Here is the question and the two answers ( the choice order is random ) :
Question : Why did people say the story about Clinton hiding under a blanket to meet a woman was untrue?
Choices :
A1A: It was published by the Washington Times
A2A: He could not have gotten back home without being found out
Bob is arguing for 1 and Alice is arguing for 2.
Here is the transcript of the debate :

####Alice says:#### 
Passage :
The claim that Clinton hid under a blanket to meet a woman was immediately dismissed as implausible because of the stringent security measures surrounding the President. < u_passage >""Clinton couldn't get his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.)"" </ u_passage > This stringent security detail and the numerous checkpoints make it virtually impossible for the President to discreetly exit and return to the White House unnoticed.  The Secret Service detail would be indispensable in any clandestine rendezvous, and the elaborate logistics make it highly improbable for the President to sneak out and back in, leaving no trace.

####Bob says:#### 
The article explicitly states: ""< v_passage >The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement</ v_passage >"" when presenting the story about Clinton. Focusing on this phrase, we can see the sensationalist tone indicative of the Washington Times. It wasn't just reporting the story; they were reveling in it. This publication has a vested interest in discrediting Clinton and a history of pushing narratives favorable to their partisan views.

Therefore, regardless of the truth of the tale about Clinton hiding under a blanket, the mere fact it originated from the Washington Times made it suspect. People dismissed the story because they understood the source's inherent bias and tendency towards sensationalism.

####Alice says:#### 
The story of Clinton sneaking out under a blanket was deemed implausible due to the stringent security protocols surrounding the President. < v_passage >""Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.)"" </ v_passage > This passage illustrates the numerous checkpoints and the constant presence of Secret Service agents, making any clandestine operation practically impossible. Given these security measures, the idea that Clinton could discreetly slip out and return unnoticed is highly improbable.

####Bob says:#### 
I am arguing that the story about Clinton hiding under a blanket was dismissed because it originated from the Washington Times, a publication known for its sensationalism and politically charged narratives. It's crucial not to concede to the other side's argument about logistics because it shifts the focus away from the immediate credibility issue. The article itself states: < v_passage >""The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement</ v_passage >"" when presenting the story. This phrase reveals the publication's bias and eagerness to promote a narrative damaging to Clinton. People understood the source's proclivity for exaggeration and partisan attacks, leading them to dismiss the story out of hand.

####Alice says:#### 
I am arguing that the story about Clinton sneaking out under a blanket was dismissed because it was logistically impossible given the tight security surrounding the President. The article clearly states this: < v_passage >""Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.)"" </ v_passage > Given these stringent security measures, the idea of Clinton escaping unnoticed, especially at 4 am, is just not feasible.

####Bob says:#### 
The reason people dismissed the story about Clinton hiding under a blanket is directly related to the source. < v_passage >""The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement</ v_passage >"" when presenting the story. This phrasing reveals the publication's predisposition to sensationalism and its clear bias against Clinton. People understood the Washington Times' tendency to promote narratives that support their political agenda, making them inherently unreliable. The source itself immediately cast doubt on the story's credibility, leading people to reject it outright.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments and the reasoning behind my choice:

**Alice's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Alice focuses on the logistics of the scenario presented in the story. She uses direct quotes from the article to highlight the stringent security measures surrounding the President, making it implausible for Clinton to sneak out unnoticed.
* **Weakness:** While Alice's point about security is strong, she doesn't address the potential bias of the source, which Bob brings up.

**Bob's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Bob correctly identifies the source of the story as The Washington Times and points out their history of sensationalism and political bias. He uses a direct quote from the article to illustrate the publication's excitement in presenting the story, suggesting they were more interested in promoting a narrative than reporting objectively.
* **Weakness:** Bob's argument relies heavily on assumptions about the Washington Times' bias. While their reputation might support this, it doesn't directly address why people dismissed the story.

**Analysis:**

Both debaters present valid points. Alice's argument is grounded in the factual impossibility of the scenario presented, while Bob's argument focuses on the source's credibility and potential bias. However, the article itself provides a quote (""The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement"") that directly supports Bob's claim about the publication's bias. This, coupled with the article's clear intention to present the story in a sensationalized manner, makes Bob's argument more compelling.

**Final Answer:** The answer is A2A.

Here is the question and the two answers ( the choice order is random ) :
Question : What made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery?
Choices :
A1A: Their staff did not know
A2A: The secret service budget was small
Bob is arguing for 1 and Alice is arguing for 2.
Here is the transcript of the debate :

####Alice says:#### 
The answer to the question of what made it easier for previous presidents to get away with adultery is the small size and limited budget of the Secret Service in earlier eras. < v_passage > During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980).  </ v_passage > This massive increase in resources and personnel makes it virtually impossible for presidents to evade their protection, as exemplified by the article's  statement: < v_passage >  ""Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. "" </ v_passage > This heightened security presence undoubtedly acts as a significant deterrent

####Bob says:#### 
The article asserts that presidential adultery was historically commonplace, stating that, ""Historically, presidential adultery is common.""

< v_passage > Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt ""entertained"" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. </ v_passage >

This casual approach was possible because their staffs were less aware of, and less likely to report, such indiscretions. The article highlights how the culture has changed, stating that, “John F. Kennedy could openly flaunt his affairs, but such behavior is practically impossible today.""

The increased security, media scrutiny, and sense of accountability have made it significantly harder for presidents to engage in adultery discreetly. The article underscores this, emphasizing how:

< v_passage > For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm

####Alice says:#### 
The article clearly states that the smaller size and budget of the Secret Service in the past made it easier for presidents to get away with adultery. <Passage> During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980).</Passage> This massive increase in resources directly translates to stricter security measures, making it practically impossible for a president to evade their protection today. <Passage>""Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.""</Passage> The size and scope of the Secret Service today are a far greater deterrent to presidential indiscretions than the potential for staff discretion in the past.

####Bob says:#### 
While it is true that the Secret Service has grown significantly since previous eras, my opponent ignores the crucial role of staff silence in enabling presidential infidelity. The article clearly states that

< v_passage > ""Historically, presidential adultery is common.""</ v_passage >

This implies that even with a smaller and less robust Secret Service, presidents were able to maintain their affairs because their staff remained complicit.

Furthermore, the article underscores that

< v_passage > ""Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members."" </ v_passage >

This reveals that these indiscretions flourished not because the Secret Service

####Alice says:#### 
The question asks what made it easier for past presidents to get away with adultery. The answer is the drastically smaller budget allocated to the Secret Service in prior eras. < Passage> During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). </ Passage>  This increase in personnel and resources directly translates to sophisticated security practices.   The article is clear:   < Passage>“Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.” </ Passage > This inescapable presence renders the Secret Service a significant hurdle for any president hoping to engage in clandestine affairs.

####Bob says:#### 
I'm arguing the smaller size of the Secret Service was not the main reason presidential adultery was easier in the past. The article itself states < v_passage > ""Historically, presidential adultery is common."" </ v_passage > This suggests that even with less robust security, presidents could get away with infidelity due to their staff's complicity. Look at the Kennedy example.  Many staff members, from aides to drivers and even family members, were aware but kept quiet. < v_passage > ""Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests."" </ v_passage >   A bigger Secret Service wouldn't have stopped this culture of silence.

##  Analysis of the Debate:

Both Alice and Bob bring up valid points, but their arguments rely on different interpretations of the article's evidence. Let's break it down:

**Alice's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Alice consistently connects the growth of the Secret Service (increased size and budget) to enhanced security and a  direct impact on presidential actions. She highlights the article's statement ""Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection.""
* **Weakness:** While she correctly points out the increased security, she doesn't fully address the article's claim that ""Historically, presidential adultery is common,"" suggesting it wasn't exclusively due to lack of security.

**Bob's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Bob focuses on the historical context of presidential adultery and emphasizes staff complicity as a key factor. He uses the Kennedy example to illustrate how widespread knowledge existed within the White House without necessarily being a result of the Secret Service size.
* **Weakness:** Bob doesn't directly address Alice's point about the modern Secret Service's ability to prevent discreet actions, relying primarily on historical examples.

##  Evaluation and Decision:

The article's core message seems to be that while presidential adultery has been common historically, the contemporary environment with a vastly larger and more robust Secret Service makes it far more difficult to conceal. 

While Bob makes valid points about the role of staff discretion, Alice's argument aligns more closely with the article's overarching message about the impact of increased security on presidential behavior.

Here is the question and the two answers ( the choice order is random ) :
Question : Where in the White House is it feasible for the president to meet a woman?
Choices :
A1A: Only the private quarters or the office restroom
A2A: Only the East Wing
Bob is arguing for 1 and Alice is arguing for 2.
Here is the transcript of the debate :

####Alice says:#### 
The article explicitly states that a president cannot avoid Secret Service scrutiny while in the White House. < v_passage >"" Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.)"" </ v_passage > This eliminates both the office restroom and the private quarters, as they are located within the heavily guarded residential area. The East Wing, however,  offers a plausible scenario for discreet entry and exit, as outlined in the “White House Sneak” scenario. 

< v_passage > A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database.

####Bob says:#### 
The article meticulously details the near-insurmountable obstacles to presidential infidelity, making locations like the East Wing improbable. < u_passage >The Secret Service Agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves</ u_passage >. Moreover, < u_passage >A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her [the woman]. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. </ u_passage >This constant surveillance makes the East Wing, and other public areas, unsuitable for clandestine meetings. Only the president’s private quarters, with limited access and fewer security personnel, and the relative privacy of a restroom offer any semblance of feasible discretion.

####Alice says:#### 
The article clearly outlines a feasible scenario for a president to meet a woman in the East Wing. Referring to the ""White House Sneak"" scenario, < u_passage >""A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer… A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing… The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor"" </ u_passage >. This detailed description underscores that access to the private quarters, situated in the East Wing, is possible through controlled checkpoints and security protocols. 

While other areas might present logistical hurdles, the East Wing remains the only plausible location given the outlined procedures.

####Bob says:#### 
The article clearly states that the president can only escape Secret Service scrutiny within his private quarters. < v_passage >"" Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.)"" </ v_passage >  This eliminates the East Wing as a viable option.  Furthermore, the article highlights the ""residence"" as a location of greater privacy, where the Secret Service presence is limited. < u_passage >The Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves.</ u_passage >  Therefore, while unconventional, the private quarters or a restroom offer the only feasible locations for a clandestine meeting.

####Alice says:#### 
The article clearly outlines a feasible scenario for a president to meet a woman in the East Wing.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments and my reasoning:

**Alice's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Alice focuses on a specific scenario outlined in the article, the ""White House Sneak,"" which details a step-by-step process for a woman to access the East Wing. She highlights the controlled checkpoints and security protocols in this scenario.
* **Weakness:**  Alice relies heavily on the ""White House Sneak"" scenario, which, while described in detail, might be presented as a hypothetical or an exception rather than the norm. Her argument doesn't sufficiently address the broader issue of constant Secret Service surveillance mentioned by Bob.

**Bob's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Bob emphasizes the pervasive nature of Secret Service surveillance throughout the White House, citing the article's statement that Clinton couldn't ""give his Secret Service agents the slip.""  He logically connects this to the difficulty of having a secret meeting in public areas like the East Wing.
* **Weakness:** Bob's reliance on the phrase ""the residence"" being a place of greater privacy might be misleading. While it's likely the residence offers more privacy than public areas, the article doesn't definitively state that the president is completely alone within the residence.  He doesn't directly engage with Alice's  ""White House Sneak"" scenario.



**Analysis and Decision**

While Alice's ""White House Sneak"" scenario presents a plausible path for a meeting in the East Wing, Bob's broader point about the relentless presence of Secret Service agents throughout the White House carries more weight. The article consistently emphasizes the difficulty of escaping surveillance.

**The answer is A1A** .

Question : What is the best way for a president to sneak a woman into the White House?
Choices :
A1A: Through the gate
A2A: Through the tunnel
Alice is arguing for 1 and Bob is arguing for 2.
Here is the transcript of the debate :

####Alice says:#### 
The article clearly states that the most plausible scenario for a President to discreetly bring a woman into the White House involves using ""the gate."" < v_passage > A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. </ v_passage >

 This method relies on established procedures and the assurance that Secret Service agents are bound by discretion. While there are risks, the article emphasizes that these risks are manageable and minimized due to the controlled environment.

####Bob says:#### 
While other methods rely on discreetly manipulating the strict security protocols surrounding the White House, the tunnel offers a clandestine path. The article mentions the ""much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department,"" implying its existence and potential use. < v_passage >The much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. </ v_passage >  While the tunnel is reportedly well-guarded, it's plausible that a clandestine entry with the aid of a trusted accomplice could be possible, especially if access points within the tunnel can be bypassed.

The logistical complexities of coordinating entries through main gates with scads of Secret Service agents present a higher risk than leveraging a less conventional route.

####Alice says:#### 
I maintain that the most secure and discreet method for a president to bring a woman into the White House is through the gate. The article clearly outlines a procedure where a woman can be escorted directly to the private quarters using existing protocols and security measures. < u_passage > A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. ...The president opens the door and welcomes her. </ u_passage >

While there are risks associated with this method, the article emphasizes that they are manageable due to the controlled environment and the understanding that Secret Service agents are bound by discretion. Relying on the tunnel, as suggested by my opponent, is highly improbable given its well-guarded nature and the likelihood of leaving a trail of suspicious activity.

####Bob says:#### 
While navigating the White House's security protocols presents a challenge, the best way for a president to sneak a woman into the White House is through the tunnel. The ""White House Sneak"" method relies on numerous individuals knowing about the visit, increasing the risk of exposure. < v_passage >A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer</ v_passage >. This vulnerability significantly undermines the secrecy required for a clandestine affair.

The tunnel, while described as ""well-guarded,"" presents a less conventional entry point that could potentially be bypassed with the help of a trusted accomplice. < v_passage >The much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer.

Here's a breakdown of the arguments and the reasoning behind my decision:

**Alice's Arguments:**

* **Strength:** Alice relies heavily on direct quotes from the article (<v_passage>) to outline a specific procedure for entering the White House through the gate.  This procedure seems well-defined and, according to the article, involves controlled checkpoints and security measures. 
* **Weakness:** While Alice cites these procedures, she doesn't fully address the potential risks Bob raises regarding the number of people who would be aware of the woman's presence.

**Bob's Arguments:**

* **Strength:** Bob focuses on the inherent risk associated with the ""Gate"" method due to the multiple individuals who would be aware of the situation. He uses the article to back up this point (<v_passage>).
* **Weakness:** Bob's argument about the tunnel relies more on speculation and less on concrete evidence from the article. He claims it could be bypassed, but doesn't provide details or quotes to support this.


**Analysis:**

Both debaters use quotes effectively, but Alice's arguments are more grounded in the concrete details provided in the article. While Bob raises valid concerns about the risks associated with the ""Gate"" method, he doesn't present a compelling alternative supported by evidence from the text. 

**Final Answer:** The answer is A1A

Here is the question and the two answers ( the choice order is random ) :
Question : Why would the president choose to let agents go with him to meet a woman?
Choices :
A1A: There is no way he can avoid it
A2A: He would have to notify a cabinet member to get out of it
Bob is arguing for 1 and Alice is arguing for 2.
Here is the transcript of the debate :

####Alice says:#### 
The assertion that the president cannot avoid meeting a woman with Secret Service agents present is flawed. As the article clearly states, the president ""could refuse all Secret Service protection,"" < v_passage >but it would be far more trouble than it's worth.</ v_passage > His departure without the necessary notification and procedure would immediately trigger alarms.  

< v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage > This implies that a high-level cabinet member would be informed before any clandestine meeting could take place. The president cannot simply ""choose"" to let agents accompany him without plausible explanation and proper channels.

####Bob says:#### 
The article examines the logistical complexities surrounding potential presidential infidelity, emphasizing the near-impossibility of a president escaping Secret Service protection. As stated, ""Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.""  < v_passage > Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. </ v_passage >   This demonstrates the constant and inescapable nature of their presence.

####Alice says:#### 
The passage states that the president ""could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. < v_passage > He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage >""

This clearly indicates that circumventing Secret Service protection is not a simple decision. Bypassing established security procedures requires notifying high-ranking cabinet members, signifying a level of transparency that directly contradicts the idea of a clandestine meeting. The president cannot simply choose to disregard Secret Service presence; he would need to engage in a formal process that would involve cabinet-level notification.

####Bob says:#### 
The statement that the president could simply ""choose"" to let agents accompany him to meet a woman is misleading.  The article makes it clear that the Secret Service's presence is not a matter of choice for the President: < v_passage >Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.</ v_passage > This relentless vigilance demonstrates that the president cannot simply bypass their protection for personal encounters.

Therefore, there is no way he can avoid having agents present.

####Alice says:#### 
While it is true that presidents have some leeway in handling security detail, suggesting they can easily ""choose"" to have agents accompany them for a clandestine meeting is misleading.  The article states,

< v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage > This clearly indicates that circumventing Secret Service protection is not a simple decision. Such a move would require formal notification and involvement of high-ranking cabinet members, making the act far from clandestine and impossible to conceal.

####Bob says:#### 
The question asks why a president would choose to let agents accompany him. The article makes it abundantly clear that the president doesn't have a choice in the matter. < v_passage >Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.</ v_passage > This shows the president is constantly under the watchful eye of the Secret Service. Even if hypothetically the president could refuse protection, as discussed later  < v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage >, the required notifications make the meeting anything but private.

As stated, ""Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.""  < v_passage > Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. </ v_passage >   This demonstrates the constant and inescapable nature of their presence.

####Alice says:#### 
The passage states that the president ""could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. < v_passage > He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage >""

This clearly indicates that circumventing Secret Service protection is not a simple decision. Bypassing established security procedures requires notifying high-ranking cabinet members, signifying a level of transparency that directly contradicts the idea of a clandestine meeting. The president cannot simply choose to disregard Secret Service presence; he would need to engage in a formal process that would involve cabinet-level notification.

####Bob says:#### 
The statement that the president could simply ""choose"" to let agents accompany him to meet a woman is misleading.  The article makes it clear that the Secret Service's presence is not a matter of choice for the President: < v_passage >Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.</ v_passage > This relentless vigilance demonstrates that the president cannot simply bypass their protection for personal encounters.

Therefore, there is no way he can avoid having agents present.

####Alice says:#### 
While it is true that presidents have some leeway in handling security detail, suggesting they can easily ""choose"" to have agents accompany them for a clandestine meeting is misleading.  The article states,

< v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage > This clearly indicates that circumventing Secret Service protection is not a simple decision. Such a move would require formal notification and involvement of high-ranking cabinet members, making the act far from clandestine and impossible to conceal.

####Bob says:#### 
The question asks why a president would choose to let agents accompany him. The article makes it abundantly clear that the president doesn't have a choice in the matter. < v_passage >Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.</ v_passage > This shows the president is constantly under the watchful eye of the Secret Service. Even if hypothetically the president could refuse protection, as discussed later  < v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage >, the required notifications make the meeting anything but private.

Let's break down the arguments:

**Alice's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Alice focuses on the article's statement that the president must inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury if they want to forgo security.  This suggests a formal process that would make a clandestine meeting difficult. 
* **Weakness:** Alice doesn't directly address Bob's point that the president can't realistically escape Secret Service presence.

**Bob's Argument:**

* **Strength:** Bob emphasizes the article's descriptions of the constant vigilance of the Secret Service and how difficult it would be for the president to arrange a private meeting.
* **Weakness:** Bob's reliance on the quote, ""Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip,"" might be overstating the case.  While it highlights the difficulty, it doesn't definitively rule out the possibility of a president finding a way to discreetly meet someone with minimal Secret Service presence.

**Analyzing the Quotes:**

* The key quotes are:
    *  < v_passage >He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury.</ v_passage > - This strengthens Alice's point about the formality involved in bypassing security. 
    * < v_passage >Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed.</ v_passage > - This supports Bob's argument about the difficulty of escaping Secret Service attention.


**Final Decision:**

While both sides make valid points, Alice's focus on the formal notification process and the requirement to inform high-ranking officials provides a more compelling explanation for why the president couldn't simply ""choose"" to have agents present for a clandestine meeting.
