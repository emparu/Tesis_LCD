0,"The logistics of presidential adultery. 

           

         The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement: ""A former FBI agent assigned to the White House describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his Secret Service detail in the dead of night, hides under a blanket in the back of a dark-colored sedan, and trysts with a woman, possibly a celebrity, at the JW Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington."" For Clinton-haters, Gary Aldrich's tale sounded too good to be true. 

         And it was. The not-so-Secret-Service agent's ""source"" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) 

         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. 

         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt ""entertained"" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. 

         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. 

          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: 

                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: 

                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. 

         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, ""There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him."" 

                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. 

         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. 

                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a ""the residence,"" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. 

         The president dials a ""friend"" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. 

         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. 

          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. 

          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. 

         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. 

                         2) The ""Off-the-Record"" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an ""off-the-record"" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. 

                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. 

                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. 

         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) 

         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.

          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. 

          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. 

         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. 

                         2) The ""Off-the-Record"" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an ""off-the-record"" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. 

                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. 

                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. 

         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) 

         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.

         The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement: ""A former FBI agent assigned to the White House describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his Secret Service detail in the dead of night, hides under a blanket in the back of a dark-colored sedan, and trysts with a woman, possibly a celebrity, at the JW Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington."" For Clinton-haters, Gary Aldrich's tale sounded too good to be true. 

         And it was. The not-so-Secret-Service agent's ""source"" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) 

         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. 

         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt ""entertained"" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. 

         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. 

          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: 

                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: 

                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. 

         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, ""There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him."" 

                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. 

         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. 

                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a ""the residence,"" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. 

         The president dials a ""friend"" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. 

         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. 

          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. 

          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her.

The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. 

         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again.

         The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement: ""A former FBI agent assigned to the White House describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his Secret Service detail in the dead of night, hides under a blanket in the back of a dark-colored sedan, and trysts with a woman, possibly a celebrity, at the JW Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington."" For Clinton-haters, Gary Aldrich's tale sounded too good to be true. 

         And it was. The not-so-Secret-Service agent's ""source"" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) 

         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. 

         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt ""entertained"" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. 

         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. 

          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: 

                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: 

                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. 

         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, ""There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him."" 

                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. 

         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. 

                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a ""the residence,"" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. 

         The president dials a ""friend"" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. 

         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. 

          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. 

          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. 

         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. 

                         2) The ""Off-the-Record"" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an ""off-the-record"" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. 

                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. 

                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. 

         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) 

         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.

         Why the human race keeps getting faster. 

                         By Andrew Berry              

         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) 

         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? 

         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. 

         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call ""secular"" trends. (In this context, ""secular"" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. 

          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls ""average economic circumstances"" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. 

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. 

         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. 

         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. 

          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as ""hybrid vigor."" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is ""better"" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. 

         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. 

         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. 

         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. 

         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.

         Why the human race keeps getting faster. 

                         By Andrew Berry              

         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) 

         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? 

         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. 

         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call ""secular"" trends. (In this context, ""secular"" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. 

          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls ""average economic circumstances"" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. 

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. 

         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since.

Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. 

         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes.

That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups.

2,"The Absurdity of Family Love 

         Don't get me wrong. Kids are great. I have some, and I adore them. Every Christmas I become a slave to my camcorder. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, and so on. But now that the radiance of the yuletide season is fading, it's time to confront a sobering scientific truth: The more you think about the biology of parental love, the more absurd it seems. The same goes for love of kin generally--brothers, sisters, nephews, etc. 

         Readers familiar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attempt to spoil everyone's fun, to replace the beautiful mystery of life with ugly Darwinian clarity. Actually, what I hope to dispel isn't pre-Darwinian mystery, but a kind of post-Darwinian mysticism, a confused exaltation of genetic affinity. You see the confusion when biological parents invoke ""blood ties"" to reclaim a child from adoptive parents. You see it when opponents of cross-ethnic adoption argue--as in a New York Times op-ed piece a few months ago--that we must respect ""the strength of the biological and cultural ties that Indian tribes can offer their own children."" In a sense, you see it every year around Christmas, when people pay lip service to the idea of universal brotherhood but believe in their hearts that it's ridiculous, that truly loving people to whom you aren't related violates some law of nature. 

         Thanks to the biologist William Hamilton, it is now clear why people feel brotherly love in the literal sense--and sisterly love, maternal love, and paternal love. It's all due to the operation of ""kin selection"" during evolution. A greatly oversimplified textbook example: Two million years ago, two hominids, Loveless Bob and Loving Bob, stand on two different riverbanks, in identical situations. Each is watching his full sibling Bill drown. Loving Bob has a gene inclining him to love his brother and thus jump in the raging river, even though his risk of dying is 10 percent. Loveless Bob has no such gene, and thus stands on the bank wondering whether his brother's corpse will attract any large, edible fish. Which Bob's genes will survive the Darwinian reaper--genes for love or for cold indifference? 

         Love triumphs. True, there's a one-in-10 chance that the love gene will sink along with Loving Bob. But consider the upside. There's a one-in-two chance that Bob's full sibling Bill has the same gene and, thus, that a successful rescue mission will pluck an otherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history. Do the math, and you'll see that, over time, Loving Bobs send more genes to posterity than Loveless Bobs. As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genes, Loveless Bobs slowly become extinct. Die, selfish scum! Genes for sibling love come to permeate our species--as, in fact, they now do. So do genes for maternal love and paternal love. All brought to you by kin selection. 

         As modern Darwinism gets popularized, the basic idea of kin selection is approaching the status of conventional wisdom. So are some attendant misconceptions. 

          Misconception No. 1: Genes are smart . People often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can magically sense copies of itself in other organisms--or, at least, can somehow ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its own host organism and thus may carry copies of itself. In truth, genes aren't omniscient, or even sentient. If kin-selected genes are going to induce love of kin, they'll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian and probably fallible way. 

         For example: Back when Loving Bob was 6 years old, if his mother was nursing some infant named Bill and sleeping by its side every night, there's a very good chance that Bill was Bob's sibling. So a gene disposing Bob to love children whom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population until everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire now and then, when a mother is for some reason nurturing a non-offspring. It's just that the misfiring wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation. 

         Little is known about which rules for identifying kin--""kin-recognition mechanisms""--do operate in our species. But clearly, they are fallible. Even mothers, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who their offspring are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital staffers for some reason handed hours-old Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers, the mother's kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This woman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter (though the mother died two years later, so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother). Meanwhile, Kimberly's genetic mother, having missed years of bonding, can never love Kimberly quite like her own child, even though Kimberly is her own child. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter. 

         This irrelevance of genes is why surrogate motherhood is so messy. Even when, thanks to in vitro fertilization, the birth mother is unrelated to the fetus she carries, she will, upon giving birth, fall in love with the child. During evolution, after all, having a baby come out of your womb was reasonably strong evidence of kinship. The power of the hormones that govern this bonding is familiar to anyone who has watched a woman clutch her just-born child and turn into a love-drunk cuddle-bunny. (When my wife went through this magic moment, I briefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an 8-by-10 glossy of myself.) This hormonal power was also observed by researchers studying oxytocin, a hormone that's present in human and other mammalian mothers at birth. The researchers put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previous records for cuddling among laboratory rats. By the way, the synthetic version of oxytocin, Pitocin, is what doctors use to induce labor. 

          Misconception No. 2: People are smart--or, at least, they are smart Darwinian robots . Darwinian theory does posit that homo sapiens were ""designed"" to get their genes into the next generation, but not that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally. As surrogate mothers have proved, knowing that you've given no genes to an infant needn't stop the bonding process. Thus, ""kin- recognition mechanism"" is a doubly misleading term--first because, as we've seen, the mechanism doesn't positively identify kin, but just identifies factors correlated with kinship; and second because people aren't really aware of doing the identifying. We don't think, ""There's strong evidence that she's my daughter, so I adore her."" More like, ""God but my daughter's adorable."" 

         It is good news for adoptive parents that neither genetic relationship nor conscious awareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love. Still, it is bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth. It is also bad news that breast-feeding, which adoptive mothers usually can't do, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin. Then again, there is no reason in principle that adoptive parents couldn't take Pitocin once a day for synthetic bonding sessions. (Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in men, too.) Besides, some genetic mothers aren't conscious at birth, and many don't breast-feed, yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their kids. As the many successful adoptive parents know, lots of the magic moments that add up to durabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breast-feeding. (Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow ... ) 

         Anyway, the main point is that when genetic parents give up a child for adoption and have second thoughts weeks, months, or even years later, their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch. Their love of their child, and their child's love of them, depends not on genetic math but on a long and complex chain of bonding, much of which they have already voluntarily missed out on. 

         Similarly, the idea that Native American babies, or black babies, or whatever, have some mystical genetic affinity with their ""own"" kind is silly. Obviously, cross-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and playground taunts, and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis. But it won't do this because of some ancestral memory in the genes. As attitudes change, cross-ethnic adoption will get easier; and as cross-ethnic adoption gets more common, attitudes will change. (There are other pop-genetics arguments against cross-ethnic adoption, and against adoption in general. One is that genes influence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated siblings is like mixing oil and water. This idea is .) 

          Misconception No. 3: Our genes, though perhaps not real smart, aren't downright stupid . Here we come, at last, to the true absurdity of familial love. As we've seen, the genes that sponsor it flourished by encouraging an ""altruism"" that was, in fact, self-serving at the genetic level (the inexorable triumph of Loving Bob's genes). As we've also seen, these genes can be ""fooled"" into encouraging altruism toward non-kin, altruism that presumably is not self-serving at the genetic level. Still, you might argue, in defense of your genes, they usually direct familial love toward genuine kin, and thus usually succeed in being efficiently selfish. Wrong! When genes confine altruism to kin, and deny it to needy non-kin, they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfish. Because nowadays, copies of these genes do reside in non-kin--in your next-door neighbor and, for that matter, your worst enemy. After all, the Darwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeated our entire species! Loveless Bob is extinct, remember? 

         You can be forgiven for doubting my logic. People like me, in writing about kin selection, often talk about full siblings sharing ""half their genes,"" implying that nonrelatives share none. But in truth, you share virtually all your genes with any randomly selected homo sapien on any continent. What people like me really mean is that full siblings share half of any genes that are newly minted--genes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is just starting to pass judgment. Genes that natural selection fully endorsed long ago--the basic genes for hunger, for lust, for familial love--are in everyone. So genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerning selfishness--by discriminating against people not containing copies of themselves--now, having spread through the species, discriminate against people who do contain copies! You may doubt that natural selection, a process that supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness, could fail so abjectly to do so. But it's true. . 

         So this past holiday season, as you rushed to buy presents for your kids or your siblings or your nieces or nephews, impelled by ""selfishly"" altruistic genes, you were operating under flawed Darwinian logic. These ""selfish"" genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging you to instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store. In fact, they could do more, since the beggar is closer to perishing than your relatives are. (Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as food, as opposed to a hair-eating Cabbage Patch doll.) But our genes are too stupid to so deftly serve their own welfare. 

         Not that I attach much weight to what is and isn't ""good"" from the standpoint of genetic self-interest. As virtually all ethical philosophers who have pondered the matter agree, it doesn't make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway; to infer ought from is --to commit the ""naturalistic fallacy""--only leads to moral confusion. For example, you might, after observing the natural behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good for females to eat males after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant and wrongheaded doctrine! (Though slightly less repugnant than the idea of eating males before the sex.) 

         Most people implicitly recognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts. They sense that there's something visceral about, say, malice; yet they'll tell you (when not in its thrall) that they disapprove of it. It's obvious, they believe, that the natural strength of hatred is not a good thing. They're right. What is equally right, but a bit less obvious, is that the ""natural"" limits of love aren't necessarily good either. And, on close inspection, these limits turn out not to be all that rigorously ""natural"" anyway.

         Similarly, the idea that Native American babies, or black babies, or whatever, have some mystical genetic affinity with their ""own"" kind is silly. Obviously, cross-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and playground taunts, and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis. But it won't do this because of some ancestral memory in the genes. As attitudes change, cross-ethnic adoption will get easier; and as cross-ethnic adoption gets more common, attitudes will change. (There are other pop-genetics arguments against cross-ethnic adoption, and against adoption in general. One is that genes influence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated siblings is like mixing oil and water. This idea is .) 

          Misconception No. 3: Our genes, though perhaps not real smart, aren't downright stupid . Here we come, at last, to the true absurdity of familial love. As we've seen, the genes that sponsor it flourished by encouraging an ""altruism"" that was, in fact, self-serving at the genetic level (the inexorable triumph of Loving Bob's genes). As we've also seen, these genes can be ""fooled"" into encouraging altruism toward non-kin, altruism that presumably is not self-serving at the genetic level. Still, you might argue, in defense of your genes, they usually direct familial love toward genuine kin, and thus usually succeed in being efficiently selfish. Wrong! When genes confine altruism to kin, and deny it to needy non-kin, they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfish. Because nowadays, copies of these genes do reside in non-kin--in your next-door neighbor and, for that matter, your worst enemy. After all, the Darwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeated our entire species! Loveless Bob is extinct, remember? 

         You can be forgiven for doubting my logic. People like me, in writing about kin selection, often talk about full siblings sharing ""half their genes,"" implying that nonrelatives share none. But in truth, you share virtually all your genes with any randomly selected homo sapien on any continent. What people like me really mean is that full siblings share half of any genes that are newly minted--genes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is just starting to pass judgment. Genes that natural selection fully endorsed long ago--the basic genes for hunger, for lust, for familial love--are in everyone. So genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerning selfishness--by discriminating against people not containing copies of themselves--now, having spread through the species, discriminate against people who do contain copies! You may doubt that natural selection, a process that supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness, could fail so abjectly to do so. But it's true. . 

         So this past holiday season, as you rushed to buy presents for your kids or your siblings or your nieces or nephews, impelled by ""selfishly"" altruistic genes, you were operating under flawed Darwinian logic. These ""selfish"" genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging you to instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store. In fact, they could do more, since the beggar is closer to perishing than your relatives are. (Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as food, as opposed to a hair-eating Cabbage Patch doll.) But our genes are too stupid to so deftly serve their own welfare. 

         Not that I attach much weight to what is and isn't ""good"" from the standpoint of genetic self-interest. As virtually all ethical philosophers who have pondered the matter agree, it doesn't make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway; to infer ought from is --to commit the ""naturalistic fallacy""--only leads to moral confusion. For example, you might, after observing the natural behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good for females to eat males after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant and wrongheaded doctrine! (Though slightly less repugnant than the idea of eating males before the sex.) 

         Most people implicitly recognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts. They sense that there's something visceral about, say, malice; yet they'll tell you (when not in its thrall) that they disapprove of it. It's obvious, they believe, that the natural strength of hatred is not a good thing. They're right. What is equally right, but a bit less obvious, is that the ""natural"" limits of love aren't necessarily good either. And, on close inspection, these limits turn out not to be all that rigorously ""natural"" anyway.

2,"The Absurdity of Family Love 

         Don't get me wrong. Kids are great. I have some, and I adore them. Every Christmas I become a slave to my camcorder. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, and so on. But now that the radiance of the yuletide season is fading, it's time to confront a sobering scientific truth: The more you think about the biology of parental love, the more absurd it seems. The same goes for love of kin generally--brothers, sisters, nephews, etc. 

         Readers familiar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attempt to spoil everyone's fun, to replace the beautiful mystery of life with ugly Darwinian clarity. Actually, what I hope to dispel isn't pre-Darwinian mystery, but a kind of post-Darwinian mysticism, a confused exaltation of genetic affinity. You see the confusion when biological parents invoke ""blood ties"" to reclaim a child from adoptive parents. You see it when opponents of cross-ethnic adoption argue--as in a New York Times op-ed piece a few months ago--that we must respect ""the strength of the biological and cultural ties that Indian tribes can offer their own children."" In a sense, you see it every year around Christmas, when people pay lip service to the idea of universal brotherhood but believe in their hearts that it's ridiculous, that truly loving people to whom you aren't related violates some law of nature. 

         Thanks to the biologist William Hamilton, it is now clear why people feel brotherly love in the literal sense--and sisterly love, maternal love, and paternal love. It's all due to the operation of ""kin selection"" during evolution. A greatly oversimplified textbook example: Two million years ago, two hominids, Loveless Bob and Loving Bob, stand on two different riverbanks, in identical situations. Each is watching his full sibling Bill drown. Loving Bob has a gene inclining him to love his brother and thus jump in the raging river, even though his risk of dying is 10 percent. Loveless Bob has no such gene, and thus stands on the bank wondering whether his brother's corpse will attract any large, edible fish. Which Bob's genes will survive the Darwinian reaper--genes for love or for cold indifference? 

         Love triumphs. True, there's a one-in-10 chance that the love gene will sink along with Loving Bob. But consider the upside. There's a one-in-two chance that Bob's full sibling Bill has the same gene and, thus, that a successful rescue mission will pluck an otherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history. Do the math, and you'll see that, over time, Loving Bobs send more genes to posterity than Loveless Bobs. As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genes, Loveless Bobs slowly become extinct. Die, selfish scum! Genes for sibling love come to permeate our species--as, in fact, they now do. So do genes for maternal love and paternal love. All brought to you by kin selection. 

         As modern Darwinism gets popularized, the basic idea of kin selection is approaching the status of conventional wisdom. So are some attendant misconceptions. 

          Misconception No. 1: Genes are smart . People often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can magically sense copies of itself in other organisms--or, at least, can somehow ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its own host organism and thus may carry copies of itself. In truth, genes aren't omniscient, or even sentient. If kin-selected genes are going to induce love of kin, they'll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian and probably fallible way. 

         For example: Back when Loving Bob was 6 years old, if his mother was nursing some infant named Bill and sleeping by its side every night, there's a very good chance that Bill was Bob's sibling. So a gene disposing Bob to love children whom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population until everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire now and then, when a mother is for some reason nurturing a non-offspring. It's just that the misfiring wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation. 

         Little is known about which rules for identifying kin--""kin-recognition mechanisms""--do operate in our species. But clearly, they are fallible. Even mothers, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who their offspring are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital staffers for some reason handed hours-old Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers, the mother's kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This woman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter (though the mother died two years later, so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother). Meanwhile, Kimberly's genetic mother, having missed years of bonding, can never love Kimberly quite like her own child, even though Kimberly is her own child. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter. 

         This irrelevance of genes is why surrogate motherhood is so messy. Even when, thanks to in vitro fertilization, the birth mother is unrelated to the fetus she carries, she will, upon giving birth, fall in love with the child. During evolution, after all, having a baby come out of your womb was reasonably strong evidence of kinship. The power of the hormones that govern this bonding is familiar to anyone who has watched a woman clutch her just-born child and turn into a love-drunk cuddle-bunny. (When my wife went through this magic moment, I briefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an 8-by-10 glossy of myself.) This hormonal power was also observed by researchers studying oxytocin, a hormone that's present in human and other mammalian mothers at birth. The researchers put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previous records for cuddling among laboratory rats. By the way, the synthetic version of oxytocin, Pitocin, is what doctors use to induce labor. 

          Misconception No. 2: People are smart--or, at least, they are smart Darwinian robots . Darwinian theory does posit that homo sapiens were ""designed"" to get their genes into the next generation, but not that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally. As surrogate mothers have proved, knowing that you've given no genes to an infant needn't stop the bonding process. Thus, ""kin- recognition mechanism"" is a doubly misleading term--first because, as we've seen, the mechanism doesn't positively identify kin, but just identifies factors correlated with kinship; and second because people aren't really aware of doing the identifying. We don't think, ""There's strong evidence that she's my daughter, so I adore her."" More like, ""God but my daughter's adorable."" 

         It is good news for adoptive parents that neither genetic relationship nor conscious awareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love. Still, it is bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth. It is also bad news that breast-feeding, which adoptive mothers usually can't do, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin. Then again, there is no reason in principle that adoptive parents couldn't take Pitocin once a day for synthetic bonding sessions. (Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in men, too.) Besides, some genetic mothers aren't conscious at birth, and many don't breast-feed, yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their kids. As the many successful adoptive parents know, lots of the magic moments that add up to durabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breast-feeding. (Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow ... ) 

         Anyway, the main point is that when genetic parents give up a child for adoption and have second thoughts weeks, months, or even years later, their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch. Their love of their child, and their child's love of them, depends not on genetic math but on a long and complex chain of bonding, much of which they have already voluntarily missed out on.

People often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can magically sense copies of itself in other organisms--or, at least, can somehow ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its own host organism and thus may carry copies of itself. In truth, genes aren't omniscient, or even sentient. If kin-selected genes are going to induce love of kin, they'll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian and probably fallible way. 

         For example: Back when Loving Bob was 6 years old, if his mother was nursing some infant named Bill and sleeping by its side every night, there's a very good chance that Bill was Bob's sibling. So a gene disposing Bob to love children whom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population until everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire now and then, when a mother is for some reason nurturing a non-offspring. It's just that the misfiring wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation. 

         Little is known about which rules for identifying kin--""kin-recognition mechanisms""--do operate in our species. But clearly, they are fallible. Even mothers, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who their offspring are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital staffers for some reason handed hours-old Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers, the mother's kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This woman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter (though the mother died two years later, so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother). Meanwhile, Kimberly's genetic mother, having missed years of bonding, can never love Kimberly quite like her own child, even though Kimberly is her own child. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter. 

         This irrelevance of genes is why surrogate motherhood is so messy. Even when, thanks to in vitro fertilization, the birth mother is unrelated to the fetus she carries, she will, upon giving birth, fall in love with the child. During evolution, after all, having a baby come out of your womb was reasonably strong evidence of kinship. The power of the hormones that govern this bonding is familiar to anyone who has watched a woman clutch her just-born child and turn into a love-drunk cuddle-bunny. (When my wife went through this magic moment, I briefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an 8-by-10 glossy of myself.) This hormonal power was also observed by researchers studying oxytocin, a hormone that's present in human and other mammalian mothers at birth. The researchers put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previous records for cuddling among laboratory rats. By the way, the synthetic version of oxytocin, Pitocin, is what doctors use to induce labor. 

          Misconception No. 2: People are smart--or, at least, they are smart Darwinian robots . Darwinian theory does posit that homo sapiens were ""designed"" to get their genes into the next generation, but not that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally. As surrogate mothers have proved, knowing that you've given no genes to an infant needn't stop the bonding process. Thus, ""kin- recognition mechanism"" is a doubly misleading term--first because, as we've seen, the mechanism doesn't positively identify kin, but just identifies factors correlated with kinship; and second because people aren't really aware of doing the identifying. We don't think, ""There's strong evidence that she's my daughter, so I adore her."" More like, ""God but my daughter's adorable."" 

         It is good news for adoptive parents that neither genetic relationship nor conscious awareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love. Still, it is bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth. It is also bad news that breast-feeding, which adoptive mothers usually can't do, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin. Then again, there is no reason in principle that adoptive parents couldn't take Pitocin once a day for synthetic bonding sessions. (Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in men, too.) Besides, some genetic mothers aren't conscious at birth, and many don't breast-feed, yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their kids. As the many successful adoptive parents know, lots of the magic moments that add up to durabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breast-feeding. (Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow ... ) 

         Anyway, the main point is that when genetic parents give up a child for adoption and have second thoughts weeks, months, or even years later, their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch. Their love of their child, and their child's love of them, depends not on genetic math but on a long and complex chain of bonding, much of which they have already voluntarily missed out on. 

         Similarly, the idea that Native American babies, or black babies, or whatever, have some mystical genetic affinity with their ""own"" kind is silly. Obviously, cross-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and playground taunts, and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis. But it won't do this because of some ancestral memory in the genes. As attitudes change, cross-ethnic adoption will get easier; and as cross-ethnic adoption gets more common, attitudes will change. (There are other pop-genetics arguments against cross-ethnic adoption, and against adoption in general. One is that genes influence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated siblings is like mixing oil and water. This idea is .) 

          Misconception No. 3: Our genes, though perhaps not real smart, aren't downright stupid . Here we come, at last, to the true absurdity of familial love. As we've seen, the genes that sponsor it flourished by encouraging an ""altruism"" that was, in fact, self-serving at the genetic level (the inexorable triumph of Loving Bob's genes). As we've also seen, these genes can be ""fooled"" into encouraging altruism toward non-kin, altruism that presumably is not self-serving at the genetic level. Still, you might argue, in defense of your genes, they usually direct familial love toward genuine kin, and thus usually succeed in being efficiently selfish. Wrong! When genes confine altruism to kin, and deny it to needy non-kin, they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfish. Because nowadays, copies of these genes do reside in non-kin--in your next-door neighbor and, for that matter, your worst enemy. After all, the Darwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeated our entire species! Loveless Bob is extinct, remember? 

         You can be forgiven for doubting my logic. People like me, in writing about kin selection, often talk about full siblings sharing ""half their genes,"" implying that nonrelatives share none. But in truth, you share virtually all your genes with any randomly selected homo sapien on any continent. What people like me really mean is that full siblings share half of any genes that are newly minted--genes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is just starting to pass judgment. Genes that natural selection fully endorsed long ago--the basic genes for hunger, for lust, for familial love--are in everyone. So genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerning selfishness--by discriminating against people not containing copies of themselves--now, having spread through the species, discriminate against people who do contain copies! You may doubt that natural selection, a process that supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness, could fail so abjectly to do so. But it's true. . 

         So this past holiday season, as you rushed to buy presents for your kids or your siblings or your nieces or nephews, impelled by ""selfishly"" altruistic genes, you were operating under flawed Darwinian logic. These ""selfish"" genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging you to instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store. In fact, they could do more, since the beggar is closer to perishing than your relatives are. (Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as food, as opposed to a hair-eating Cabbage Patch doll.) But our genes are too stupid to so deftly serve their own welfare. 

         Not that I attach much weight to what is and isn't ""good"" from the standpoint of genetic self-interest. As virtually all ethical philosophers who have pondered the matter agree, it doesn't make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway; to infer ought from is --to commit the ""naturalistic fallacy""--only leads to moral confusion. For example, you might, after observing the natural behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good for females to eat males after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant and wrongheaded doctrine! (Though slightly less repugnant than the idea of eating males before the sex.) 

         Most people implicitly recognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts. They sense that there's something visceral about, say, malice; yet they'll tell you (when not in its thrall) that they disapprove of it. It's obvious, they believe, that the natural strength of hatred is not a good thing. They're right. What is equally right, but a bit less obvious, is that the ""natural"" limits of love aren't necessarily good either. And, on close inspection, these limits turn out not to be all that rigorously ""natural"" anyway.

3,"The Absurdity of Family Love 

         Don't get me wrong. Kids are great. I have some, and I adore them. Every Christmas I become a slave to my camcorder. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, and so on. But now that the radiance of the yuletide season is fading, it's time to confront a sobering scientific truth: The more you think about the biology of parental love, the more absurd it seems. The same goes for love of kin generally--brothers, sisters, nephews, etc. 

         Readers familiar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attempt to spoil everyone's fun, to replace the beautiful mystery of life with ugly Darwinian clarity. Actually, what I hope to dispel isn't pre-Darwinian mystery, but a kind of post-Darwinian mysticism, a confused exaltation of genetic affinity. You see the confusion when biological parents invoke ""blood ties"" to reclaim a child from adoptive parents. You see it when opponents of cross-ethnic adoption argue--as in a New York Times op-ed piece a few months ago--that we must respect ""the strength of the biological and cultural ties that Indian tribes can offer their own children."" In a sense, you see it every year around Christmas, when people pay lip service to the idea of universal brotherhood but believe in their hearts that it's ridiculous, that truly loving people to whom you aren't related violates some law of nature. 

         Thanks to the biologist William Hamilton, it is now clear why people feel brotherly love in the literal sense--and sisterly love, maternal love, and paternal love. It's all due to the operation of ""kin selection"" during evolution. A greatly oversimplified textbook example: Two million years ago, two hominids, Loveless Bob and Loving Bob, stand on two different riverbanks, in identical situations. Each is watching his full sibling Bill drown. Loving Bob has a gene inclining him to love his brother and thus jump in the raging river, even though his risk of dying is 10 percent. Loveless Bob has no such gene, and thus stands on the bank wondering whether his brother's corpse will attract any large, edible fish. Which Bob's genes will survive the Darwinian reaper--genes for love or for cold indifference? 

         Love triumphs. True, there's a one-in-10 chance that the love gene will sink along with Loving Bob. But consider the upside. There's a one-in-two chance that Bob's full sibling Bill has the same gene and, thus, that a successful rescue mission will pluck an otherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history. Do the math, and you'll see that, over time, Loving Bobs send more genes to posterity than Loveless Bobs. As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genes, Loveless Bobs slowly become extinct. Die, selfish scum! Genes for sibling love come to permeate our species--as, in fact, they now do. So do genes for maternal love and paternal love. All brought to you by kin selection. 

         As modern Darwinism gets popularized, the basic idea of kin selection is approaching the status of conventional wisdom. So are some attendant misconceptions. 

          Misconception No. 1: Genes are smart . People often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can magically sense copies of itself in other organisms--or, at least, can somehow ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its own host organism and thus may carry copies of itself.

So a gene disposing Bob to love children whom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population until everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire now and then, when a mother is for some reason nurturing a non-offspring. It's just that the misfiring wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation.

Even mothers, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who their offspring are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital staffers for some reason handed hours-old Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers, the mother's kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This woman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter (though the mother died two years later, so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother). Meanwhile, Kimberly's genetic mother, having missed years of bonding, can never love Kimberly quite like her own child, even though Kimberly is her own child. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter.

(Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as food, as opposed to a hair-eating Cabbage Patch doll.) But our genes are too stupid to so deftly serve their own welfare. 

         Not that I attach much weight to what is and isn't ""good"" from the standpoint of genetic self-interest. As virtually all ethical philosophers who have pondered the matter agree, it doesn't make sense to model our moral values on the logic of nature anyway; to infer ought from is --to commit the ""naturalistic fallacy""--only leads to moral confusion. For example, you might, after observing the natural behavior of praying mantises, be tempted to conclude that it is morally good for females to eat males after sex--and this, I submit, would be a repugnant and wrongheaded doctrine! (Though slightly less repugnant than the idea of eating males before the sex.) 

         Most people implicitly recognize the naturalistic fallacy in some contexts. They sense that there's something visceral about, say, malice; yet they'll tell you (when not in its thrall) that they disapprove of it. It's obvious, they believe, that the natural strength of hatred is not a good thing. They're right. What is equally right, but a bit less obvious, is that the ""natural"" limits of love aren't necessarily good either. And, on close inspection, these limits turn out not to be all that rigorously ""natural"" anyway.

3,"The Absurdity of Family Love 

         Don't get me wrong. Kids are great. I have some, and I adore them. Every Christmas I become a slave to my camcorder. Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow, and so on. But now that the radiance of the yuletide season is fading, it's time to confront a sobering scientific truth: The more you think about the biology of parental love, the more absurd it seems. The same goes for love of kin generally--brothers, sisters, nephews, etc. 

         Readers familiar with my obsessions may fear that this column is just another attempt to spoil everyone's fun, to replace the beautiful mystery of life with ugly Darwinian clarity. Actually, what I hope to dispel isn't pre-Darwinian mystery, but a kind of post-Darwinian mysticism, a confused exaltation of genetic affinity. You see the confusion when biological parents invoke ""blood ties"" to reclaim a child from adoptive parents. You see it when opponents of cross-ethnic adoption argue--as in a New York Times op-ed piece a few months ago--that we must respect ""the strength of the biological and cultural ties that Indian tribes can offer their own children."" In a sense, you see it every year around Christmas, when people pay lip service to the idea of universal brotherhood but believe in their hearts that it's ridiculous, that truly loving people to whom you aren't related violates some law of nature. 

         Thanks to the biologist William Hamilton, it is now clear why people feel brotherly love in the literal sense--and sisterly love, maternal love, and paternal love. It's all due to the operation of ""kin selection"" during evolution. A greatly oversimplified textbook example: Two million years ago, two hominids, Loveless Bob and Loving Bob, stand on two different riverbanks, in identical situations. Each is watching his full sibling Bill drown. Loving Bob has a gene inclining him to love his brother and thus jump in the raging river, even though his risk of dying is 10 percent. Loveless Bob has no such gene, and thus stands on the bank wondering whether his brother's corpse will attract any large, edible fish. Which Bob's genes will survive the Darwinian reaper--genes for love or for cold indifference? 

         Love triumphs. True, there's a one-in-10 chance that the love gene will sink along with Loving Bob. But consider the upside. There's a one-in-two chance that Bob's full sibling Bill has the same gene and, thus, that a successful rescue mission will pluck an otherwise doomed copy of the gene from the dustbin of history. Do the math, and you'll see that, over time, Loving Bobs send more genes to posterity than Loveless Bobs. As love genes spread at the expense of indifference genes, Loveless Bobs slowly become extinct. Die, selfish scum! Genes for sibling love come to permeate our species--as, in fact, they now do. So do genes for maternal love and paternal love. All brought to you by kin selection. 

         As modern Darwinism gets popularized, the basic idea of kin selection is approaching the status of conventional wisdom. So are some attendant misconceptions. 

          Misconception No. 1: Genes are smart . People often assume that kin-selected altruism is foolproof; that a gene can magically sense copies of itself in other organisms--or, at least, can somehow ascertain with perfect accuracy which organisms are close relatives of its own host organism and thus may carry copies of itself. In truth, genes aren't omniscient, or even sentient. If kin-selected genes are going to induce love of kin, they'll have to determine who qualifies as kin in some pedestrian and probably fallible way. 

         For example: Back when Loving Bob was 6 years old, if his mother was nursing some infant named Bill and sleeping by its side every night, there's a very good chance that Bill was Bob's sibling. So a gene disposing Bob to love children whom he sees his mother nurturing could spread through the population until everyone obeys the same rule. But this rule would misfire now and then, when a mother is for some reason nurturing a non-offspring. It's just that the misfiring wouldn't happen often enough to greatly dilute the genetic math favoring the gene's proliferation. 

         Little is known about which rules for identifying kin--""kin-recognition mechanisms""--do operate in our species. But clearly, they are fallible. Even mothers, who you'd think would have a damn good idea of who their offspring are, can in principle be fooled. When hospital staffers for some reason handed hours-old Kimberly Mays to a mother who was not hers, the mother's kin-recognition mechanisms--a k a bonding processes--kicked in. This woman wound up loving Kimberly like a daughter (though the mother died two years later, so that Kimberly was reared mostly by a stepmother). Meanwhile, Kimberly's genetic mother, having missed years of bonding, can never love Kimberly quite like her own child, even though Kimberly is her own child. Because genetic relationship per se doesn't matter. 

         This irrelevance of genes is why surrogate motherhood is so messy. Even when, thanks to in vitro fertilization, the birth mother is unrelated to the fetus she carries, she will, upon giving birth, fall in love with the child. During evolution, after all, having a baby come out of your womb was reasonably strong evidence of kinship. The power of the hormones that govern this bonding is familiar to anyone who has watched a woman clutch her just-born child and turn into a love-drunk cuddle-bunny. (When my wife went through this magic moment, I briefly considered snatching the baby and replacing it with an 8-by-10 glossy of myself.) This hormonal power was also observed by researchers studying oxytocin, a hormone that's present in human and other mammalian mothers at birth. The researchers put it in a syringe and used it to shatter all previous records for cuddling among laboratory rats. By the way, the synthetic version of oxytocin, Pitocin, is what doctors use to induce labor. 

          Misconception No. 2: People are smart--or, at least, they are smart Darwinian robots . Darwinian theory does posit that homo sapiens were ""designed"" to get their genes into the next generation, but not that they were designed to do so consciously and rationally. As surrogate mothers have proved, knowing that you've given no genes to an infant needn't stop the bonding process. Thus, ""kin- recognition mechanism"" is a doubly misleading term--first because, as we've seen, the mechanism doesn't positively identify kin, but just identifies factors correlated with kinship; and second because people aren't really aware of doing the identifying. We don't think, ""There's strong evidence that she's my daughter, so I adore her."" More like, ""God but my daughter's adorable."" 

         It is good news for adoptive parents that neither genetic relationship nor conscious awareness of genetic relationship is a prerequisite for love. Still, it is bad news that maternal bonding begins with hormones at birth. It is also bad news that breast-feeding, which adoptive mothers usually can't do, releases the bonding hormone oxytocin. Then again, there is no reason in principle that adoptive parents couldn't take Pitocin once a day for synthetic bonding sessions. (Oxytocin seems to be part of the bonding formula in men, too.) Besides, some genetic mothers aren't conscious at birth, and many don't breast-feed, yet they all nonetheless wind up loving their kids. As the many successful adoptive parents know, lots of the magic moments that add up to durabonding have nothing to do with birthing or breast-feeding. (Tiny tots, with their eyes all aglow ... ) 

         Anyway, the main point is that when genetic parents give up a child for adoption and have second thoughts weeks, months, or even years later, their appeals to blood ties should count for zilch. Their love of their child, and their child's love of them, depends not on genetic math but on a long and complex chain of bonding, much of which they have already voluntarily missed out on. 

         Similarly, the idea that Native American babies, or black babies, or whatever, have some mystical genetic affinity with their ""own"" kind is silly. Obviously, cross-ethnic adoption is dicey. It draws sidelong glances and playground taunts, and it may give the adopted child an identity crisis. But it won't do this because of some ancestral memory in the genes. As attitudes change, cross-ethnic adoption will get easier; and as cross-ethnic adoption gets more common, attitudes will change. (There are other pop-genetics arguments against cross-ethnic adoption, and against adoption in general. One is that genes influence personality so powerfully that mixing unrelated siblings is like mixing oil and water. This idea is .) 

          Misconception No. 3: Our genes, though perhaps not real smart, aren't downright stupid . Here we come, at last, to the true absurdity of familial love. As we've seen, the genes that sponsor it flourished by encouraging an ""altruism"" that was, in fact, self-serving at the genetic level (the inexorable triumph of Loving Bob's genes). As we've also seen, these genes can be ""fooled"" into encouraging altruism toward non-kin, altruism that presumably is not self-serving at the genetic level. Still, you might argue, in defense of your genes, they usually direct familial love toward genuine kin, and thus usually succeed in being efficiently selfish. Wrong! When genes confine altruism to kin, and deny it to needy non-kin, they are in fact failing spectacularly to be efficiently selfish. Because nowadays, copies of these genes do reside in non-kin--in your next-door neighbor and, for that matter, your worst enemy. After all, the Darwinian logic behind love of kin was so relentless that these genes permeated our entire species! Loveless Bob is extinct, remember? 

         You can be forgiven for doubting my logic. People like me, in writing about kin selection, often talk about full siblings sharing ""half their genes,"" implying that nonrelatives share none. But in truth, you share virtually all your genes with any randomly selected homo sapien on any continent. What people like me really mean is that full siblings share half of any genes that are newly minted--genes that have recently arisen and on which natural selection is just starting to pass judgment. Genes that natural selection fully endorsed long ago--the basic genes for hunger, for lust, for familial love--are in everyone. So genes that originally flourished by bestowing love with discerning selfishness--by discriminating against people not containing copies of themselves--now, having spread through the species, discriminate against people who do contain copies! You may doubt that natural selection, a process that supposedly maximizes genetic selfishness, could fail so abjectly to do so. But it's true. . 

         So this past holiday season, as you rushed to buy presents for your kids or your siblings or your nieces or nephews, impelled by ""selfishly"" altruistic genes, you were operating under flawed Darwinian logic. These ""selfish"" genes could do just as much for themselves by encouraging you to instead spend your money on the beggar outside the department store. In fact, they could do more, since the beggar is closer to perishing than your relatives are. (Also, the beggar might buy something useful such as food, as opposed to a hair-eating Cabbage Patch doll.) But our genes are too stupid to so deftly serve their own welfare.

         Why the human race keeps getting faster. 

                         By Andrew Berry              

         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) 

         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? 

         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. 

         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call ""secular"" trends. (In this context, ""secular"" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. 

          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls ""average economic circumstances"" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. 

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. 

         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. 

         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. 

          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as ""hybrid vigor."" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is ""better"" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. 

         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. 

         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. 

         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. 

         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.

         Why the human race keeps getting faster. 

                         By Andrew Berry              

         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) 

         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? 

         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. 

         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call ""secular"" trends. (In this context, ""secular"" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. 

          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls ""average economic circumstances"" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. 

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article.

Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle.

Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. 

         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.

         Why the human race keeps getting faster. 

                         By Andrew Berry              

         ( 2,168 words; posted Thursday, July 4; to be composted Thursday, July 11 ) 

         On May 6, 1954, at Oxford University's Iffley Road track, Roger Bannister became, by just half a second, the first man to run a mile in less than four minutes. The Holy Grail of middle-distance running was his. Forty-two years later, however, that achievement seems less significant. Four-minute miles are commonplace; the current record, held by Algerian Noureddine Morceli, is 3:44 , more than 5 percent faster than Bannister's speed. What Iffley Road witnessed was just another step along the road to an ever quicker mile, part of the inexorable improvement of athletic performance that we usually take for granted, particularly when the Olympics roll around. If you stop to think about it, though, such constant progress is remarkable. After all, as biomechanical machines with a standard set of parts, humans should be subject to the same limitations we see in, say, automobiles. How come they aren't? 

         A lot of entrepreneurs and technophiles would like us to think that the answer has to do with discoveries in the world of sports technology. A new Nike shoe is trumpeted as something that will shave at least one-thousandth of a second off your 100-meter time. Trainers measure the rate of buildup of lactic acid in your muscles, then claim that their programs will control it. Nutritionists fine-tune athletes' diets. Even the old sexual-abstinence-before-the-race dogma is being re-evaluated under the all-seeing eye of science. But I consider all this little more than tinkering. Sports records would continue to tumble even if training methods or athletic clothing or sexual practices were exactly the same today as they were in 1896, when the first modern Olympics took place. These minor miracles are the product neither of technology nor of training but of demographic patterns that affect us all. 

         Over the past century, the human race has been affected by a slew of what demographers call ""secular"" trends. (In this context, ""secular"" does not refer to a trend's lack of spirituality but to its longevity: Secular trends are long-term modifications, not just brief fluctuations.) One such trend is an increase in average size. You have to stoop to get through the doorways of a Tudor cottage in England because its inhabitants were smaller than you are, not because they had a penchant for crouching. Another trend is in life expectancy. People are living longer. Life expectancy in Africa increased over the past 20 years from 46 to 53 years. Over the same period in Europe, where things were already pretty comfortable to begin with, life expectancy increased from 71 to 75 years. The global average was an increase from 58 to 65 years. 

          Probably the most striking change, though, is how much more quickly children are maturing. A 12-year-old child in 1990 who was in what the World Health Organization calls ""average economic circumstances"" was about 9 inches taller than his or her 1900 counterpart. This is not solely the product of the first trend--the increase in average size--but also due to the fact that children develop faster. Girls menstruate earlier than they used to. The age of menarche (the onset of menstruation) has decreased by three or four months per decade in average sections of Western European populations for the past 150 years. There is a good chance that our 1990 12-year-old already had started to menstruate. Her 1900 counterpart would still have had three years to wait. 

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. 

         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. 

         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. 

          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as ""hybrid vigor."" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is ""better"" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. 

         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. 

         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. 

         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. 

         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.

         What do such trends have to do with athletic performance? Well, if we're living longer and growing up faster, that must mean we're producing bigger, better bodies. Better bodies imply faster miles. We run faster and faster for the same reason it is now common for 11-year-old girls to menstruate. But why are these things happening? 

          Demographers have offered a variety of explanations, but the main one is that our diet is improving. A 12-year-old ate better in 1990 than she would have in the Victorian era. This conclusion is supported by studies of the social elite: Because its members were well-nourished even in the early years of this century, this group has experienced relatively little change, over the past 100 years, in the age girls first menstruate. Another explanation is that health care is getting better. In 1991, according to the WHO, more than 75 percent of all 1-year-olds worldwide were immunized against a range of common diseases. Smallpox, that scourge of previous generations, now is effectively extinct. Probably the best measure of how much healthier we are is the rate of infant mortality, which measures both the health of the mother (a sickly mother is more likely to produce a sickly baby) and the health of the baby. In the past 20 years, infant mortality around the world has dropped from 92 deaths per 1000 live births to just 62. A lot of this can be chalked up to primary-heath-care programs in the developing world--the African average, for instance, has dropped from 135 deaths per 1000 births to 95. But there are also significant improvements in the developed world, with infant deaths dropping in Europe over the same 20-year period from 24 per 1000 live births to just 10. 

         Better health care affects athletic ability directly. This is true in the trivial case in which, say, antibiotics cure a runner's fever before the big race, but it may also be true in a more significant way. Diseases contracted in early infancy can have a lifetime impact on health--not necessarily a big one, but an impact nevertheless. Previous generations bore scars from all sorts of non-life-threatening diseases, the stuff everyone picked up as a baby. Nowadays, though, more and more people grow up with no history of disease. Since top athletes inevitably are drawn from the healthiest sector of the population, a generally superior system of health care means a bigger pool of people to draw from. You are much more likely to find someone who can run a mile in 3:30 in a sample of several million superbly healthy people than you are in a sample of 10,000. 

         The pool of potential athletes has expanded in other ways, too. First, the population has exploded. Second, we are coming ever closer to a worldwide middle class, the class from which athletes typically are drawn. Whether, in an age of multinational capitalism, we may talk reasonably about a post-colonial era is way beyond the scope of this article. The fact remains, however, that the developing world is doing just that--developing. Even Mozambique, which ranks at, or near, the bottom of national per capita gross national product tables, has shown an increase of some 20 percent in adult literacy rates over the past 20 years. Literacy rates are merely an index of education, which itself is another way of talking about a global move away from a hand-to-mouth lifestyle. 

         The decline of empire has its Olympic corollaries. Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. This is not a reflection of declining athletic standards in Britain, however; it's a function of how much more competitive other nations have become. The Olympics originally were the preserve of the socioeconomic elite of the socioeconomic elite among nations. Consider this: Only 13 nations participated in 1896, but there were 172 in 1992. Black Africans didn't take part until the third modern games, held in St. Louis in 1908. Even this was accidental: Lentauw and Yamasami, Zulu tribesmen, entered the marathon because they happened to be in St. Louis as part of an exhibit about the Boer war. Lentauw finished ninth despite being chased into a cornfield by dogs. 

         Since all these are changes in how we live, not anything innate, we have to conclude that what we are describing here are effects of environment, not genes. Let us assume that our 1900 and 1990 12-year-olds are identical twins magically born 90 years apart. The 1990 girl still will grow up faster, end up bigger, menstruate earlier, and live longer than the 1900 girl. Perhaps way, way back in human history, when our forebears were still fleeing saber-toothed tigers, natural selection for athletic prowess came into play. But all that ended long ago. Indeed, the laws of natural selection probably work against athletes these days: Given the rigors of training schedules, it is possible that today's top athletes have fewer children than average. 

          Just because nurture has a more significant effect on athletic performance doesn't mean that nature lies dormant, though. Genetic variation exists for just about any trait you choose to study, and the ability to run quickly would be no exception. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. It is quite possible that the possession of an extra toe would hinder an aspiring miler--their genes have affected their athletic performance. One genetic factor that may be influencing performance trends is what is known as ""hybrid vigor."" Cattle breeders have known about this for a long time: Take two inbred lines of cattle, cross them, and what you have is ""better"" (say, larger) than any single individual in either of the two parental lines. This does not require natural selection; it is the accidental byproduct of combining two previously isolated stocks. There are a number of theories to account for this at the genetic level, but it has proved difficult to discriminate among them. It is possible that modern humans exhibit some form of hybrid vigor simply because migration and admixture of populations are now occurring at unprecedented rates. Perhaps, just perhaps, such hybridization is being translated into enhanced performance. 

         That doesn't mean, however, that genetic differences in athletic ability can be correlated automatically with race. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. Sure, you will find more Africans or descendants of Africans standing on the podiums at the end of Olympic track events. And you will find far fewer Asians on those same podiums. But can you, therefore, conclude that Africans have better genes for running than Asians do? No. Environmental differences between the two groups could account for differing levels of athletic success. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school. The training is what's crucial, not the blackness. The Chinese sports establishment also has carried out an enormous, and effective, experiment to help dispel the myth that race has a direct relation to athletic ability. Until recently, a quick glance at the medals table confirmed every stereotype people held about Asians and sports. Then the Chinese decided to produce record-breaking female distance runners (and swimmers), and, boy, did they ever. In 1992, China ranked fourth in the Olympic-medal haul. 

         You can bring a single generation up to speed through training, but the trends we're dealing with transcend individual generations. Which brings us to another question: Will there come a time when the human machine will hit some sort of natural limit and an Olympic Games pass without a single record tumbling? In principle, yes. 

         There are some barriers that simply cannot be broken. We will never run a mile at the same speed at which we now run 100 meters, for instance. The laws of oxygen exchange will not permit it. Race horses seem already to have hit that outer limit. For years, they were as good as human athletes at pushing back speed records, but then they simply stopped getting faster. Take the prestigious British Derby. From 1850 to 1930, winning times dropped from 2:55 to 2:39. But from 1986 to 1996, the average time has been--2:39. Unlike people, race horses are specifically bred and reared to run. Generations of careful genetic selection have ensured that today's race horse has every possible speed-enhancing characteristic. Training techniques, too, are tremendously sophisticated. But you can go only so far. You can only breed horses with ultralight thin bones to a certain point; the bones will break under stress if they get any lighter. 

         Human improvement, like race-horse improvement, must eventually bow to the basic constraints of biomechanics. The age of menarche cannot keep on falling forever. On the other hand, it is clear from the remarkable demographic changes of just the past 20 years that these long-term trends are with us still. They may be slowing down in some more developed societies, but they roar along in others. And these trends will continue to fuel the improvement in athletic performance. Several new records will be set in Atlanta. And in Sydney in 2000, and wherever the Olympics are held in 2044. We will continue running faster and jumping further for a good long while to come.

         The Washington Times could hardly contain its excitement: ""A former FBI agent assigned to the White House describes in a new book how President Clinton slips past his Secret Service detail in the dead of night, hides under a blanket in the back of a dark-colored sedan, and trysts with a woman, possibly a celebrity, at the JW Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington."" For Clinton-haters, Gary Aldrich's tale sounded too good to be true. 

         And it was. The not-so-Secret-Service agent's ""source"" turned out to be a thirdhand rumor passed on by Clinton scandalmonger David Brock. Those who know about White House security--Clinton staffers, the Secret Service, former aides to Presidents Reagan and Bush--demolished Aldrich's claims. Clinton couldn't give his Secret Service agents the slip (they shadow him when he walks around the White House), couldn't arrange a private visit without tipping off hotel staff, and couldn't re-enter the White House without getting nabbed. (Guards check all cars at the gate--especially those that arrive at 4 a.m.) 

         Even so, the image resonates. For some Americans, it is an article of faith: Bill Clinton cheated on his wife when he was governor, and he cheats on her as president. But can he? Is it possible for the president of the United States to commit adultery and get away with it? Maybe, but it's tougher than you think. 

         Historically, presidential adultery is common. Warren Harding cavorted with Nan Britton and Carrie Phillips. Franklin Roosevelt ""entertained"" Lucy Rutherford at the White House when Eleanor was away. America was none the wiser, even if White House reporters were. 

         Those who know Clinton is cheating often point to the model of John F. Kennedy, who turned presidential hanky-panky into a science. Kennedy invited mistresses to the White House for afternoon (and evening, and overnight) liaisons. Kennedy seduced women on the White House staff (including, it seems, Jackie's own press secretary). Kennedy made assignations outside the White House, then escaped his Secret Service detail by scaling walls and ducking out back doors. If Kennedy did it, so can Clinton. 

          Well, no. Though Clinton slavishly emulates JFK in every other way, he'd be a fool to steal Kennedy's MO d'amour . Here's why: 

                         1) Too many people would know. Kennedy hardly bothered to hide his conquests. According to Kennedy mistress (and mob moll) Judith Campbell's autobiography, those who knew about their affair included: Kennedy's personal aides and secretary (who pandered for him), White House drivers, White House gate guards, White House Secret Service agents, White House domestic staff, most of Campbell's friends, a lot of Kennedy's friends, and several Kennedy family members. Such broad circulation would be disastrous today because: 

                         2) The press would report it. Kennedy conducted his affairs brazenly because he trusted reporters not to write about them. White House journalists knew about, or at least strongly suspected, Kennedy's infidelity, but never published a story about it. Ask Gary Hart if reporters would exercise the same restraint today. Clinton must worry about this more than most presidents. Not only are newspapers and magazines willing to publish an adultery story about him, but many are pursuing it. 

         For the same reason, Clinton would find it difficult to hire a mistress. A lovely young secretary would set off alarm bells in any reporter investigating presidential misbehavior. Says a former Clinton aide, ""There has been a real tendency to have no good-looking women on the staff in order to protect him."" 

                         3) Clinton cannot avoid Secret Service protection. During the Kennedy era, the Secret Service employed fewer than 500 people and had an annual budget of about $4 million. Then came Lee Harvey Oswald, Squeaky Fromme, and John Hinckley. Now the Secret Service payroll tops 4,500 (most of them agents), and the annual budget exceeds $500 million (up 300 percent just since 1980). At any given time, more than 100 agents guard the president in the White House. Top aides from recent administrations are adamant: The Secret Service never lets the president escape its protection. 

         So what's a randy president to do? Any modern presidential affair would need to meet stringent demands. Only a tiny number of trusted aides and Secret Service agents could know of it. They would need to maintain complete silence about it. And no reporters could catch wind of it. Such an affair is improbable, but--take heart, Clinton-haters--it's not impossible. Based on scuttlebutt and speculation from insiders at the Clinton, Bush, Reagan, and Ford White Houses, here are the four likeliest scenarios for presidential adultery. 

                         1) The White House Sneak. This is a discreet variation of the old Kennedy/Campbell liaison. It's late at night. The president's personal aides have gone home. The family is away. He is alone in the private quarters. The private quarters, a k a ""the residence,"" occupy the second and third floors of the White House. Secret Service agents guard the residence's entrances on the first floor and ground floors, but the first family has privacy in the quarters themselves. Maids and butlers serve the family there, but the president and first lady ask them to leave when they want to be alone. 

         The president dials a ""friend"" on his private line. (Most presidents placed all their calls through the White House operators, who kept a record of each one; the Clintons installed a direct-dial line in the private quarters.) The president invites the friend over for a cozy evening at the White House. After he hangs up with the friend, he phones the guard at the East Executive Avenue gate and tells him to admit a visitor. He also notifies the Secret Service agent and the usher on duty downstairs that they should send her up to the residence. 

         A taxi drops the woman near the East gate. She identifies herself to the guard, who examines her ID, runs her name through a computer (to check for outstanding warrants), and logs her in a database. A White House usher escorts her into the East Wing of the White House. They walk through the East Wing and pass the Secret Service guard post by the White House movie theater. The agent on duty waves them on. The usher takes her to the private elevator, where another Secret Service agent is posted. She takes the elevator to the second floor. The president opens the door and welcomes her. Under no circumstances could she enter the living quarters without first encountering Secret Service agents. 

          Let us pause for a moment to demolish two of the splashier rumors about White House fornication. First, the residence is the only place in the White House where the president can have safe (i.e. uninterrupted) sex. He can be intruded upon or observed everywhere else--except, perhaps, the Oval Office bathroom. Unless the president is an exhibitionist or a lunatic, liaisons in the Oval Office, bowling alley, or East Wing are unimaginable. Second, the much-touted tunnel between the White House and the Treasury Department is all-but-useless to the presidential adulterer. It is too well-guarded. The president could smuggle a mistress through it, but it would attract far more attention from White House staff than a straightforward gate entry would. 

          Meanwhile, back in the private quarters, the president and friend get comfortable in one of the 14 bedrooms (or, perhaps, the billiard room). After a pleasant 15 minutes (or two hours?), she says goodbye. Depending on how long she stays, she may pass a different shift of Secret Service agents as she departs. She exits the White House grounds, unescorted and unbothered, at the East gate. The Risks : A gate guard, an usher, and a handful of Secret Service agents see her. All of them have a very good idea of why she was there. The White House maid who changes the sheets sees other suspicious evidence. And the woman's--real--name is entered in a Secret Service computer. None of this endangers the president too much. The computer record of her visit is private, at least for several decades after he leaves office. No personal aides know about the visit. Unless they were staking out the East gate, no journalists do either. The Secret Service agents, the guard, the steward, and the maid owe their jobs to their discretion. Leaks get them fired. 

         That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. No one seriously compares Secret Service agents (who are pros) to Arkansas state troopers (who aren't). But Clinton might not trust any security guards after the beating he took from his Arkansas posse. Also, if other Secret Service agents are anything like Aldrich, they may dislike this president. One Secret Service leak--the lamp-throwing story--already damaged Clinton. Agents could tattle again. 

                         2) The ""Off-the-Record"" Visit. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an ""off-the-record"" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. He requests two agents and an unobtrusive sedan. The Secret Service shift leader grumbles, but accepts the conditions. Theoretically, the president could refuse all Secret Service protection, but it would be far more trouble than it's worth. He would have to inform the head of the Secret Service and the secretary of the Treasury. The president and the two agents drive the unmarked car to a woman friend's house. Ideally, she has a covered garage. (An apartment building or a hotel would raise considerably the risk of getting caught.) The agents guard the outside of the house while the president and his friend do their thing. Then the agents chauffeur the president back to the White House, re-entering through the Southwest or Southeast gate, away from the press station. The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. 

                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. 

                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. 

         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) 

         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.

The Risks : Only two Secret Service agents and their immediate supervisor know about the visit. It is recorded in the Secret Service log, which is not made public during the administration's tenure. Gate guards may suspect something fishy when they see the car. A reporter or passer-by could spy the president--even through tinted windows--as the car enters and exits the White House. The friend's neighbors might spot him, or they might notice the agents lurking outside her house. A neighbor might call the police to report the suspicious visitors. All in all, a risky, though not unthinkable, venture. 

                         3. The Camp David Assignation. A bucolic, safer version of the White House Sneak. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. The girlfriend is assigned the cabin next to the president's lodge. Late at night, after the Hearts game has ended and everyone has retired to their cabins, she strolls next door. There is a Secret Service command post outside the cabin. The agents on duty (probably three of them) let her enter. A few hours later, she slips back to her own cabin. The Risks : Only a few Secret Service agents know about the liaison. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady. That would raise eyebrows if it got back to the White House press room. 

                         4. The Hotel Shuffle. The cleverest strategy, and the only one that cuts out the Secret Service. The president is traveling without his family. The Secret Service secures an entire hotel floor, reserving elevators and guarding the entrance to the president's suite. The president's personal aide (a man in his late 20s) takes the room adjoining the president's. An internal door connects the two rooms, so the aide can enter the president's room without alerting the agents in the hall. This is standard practice. 

         Late in the evening, the aide escorts a comely young woman back to the hotel. The Secret Service checks her, then waves her into the aide's room. She emerges three hours later, slightly disheveled. She kisses the aide in the hall as she leaves. Someone got lucky--but who? The Risks : The posted Secret Service agents might see through the charade. More awkwardly, the aide would be forced to play the seamy role of procurer. (He would probably do it. Kennedy's assistants performed this task dutifully.) 

         In short, presidential adultery is just barely possible in 1996. But it would be extremely inconvenient, extremely risky, and potentially disastrous. It seems, in fact, a lot more trouble than it's worth. A president these days might be wiser to imitate Jimmy Carter, not Jack Kennedy, and only lust in his heart.

6,"Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what ""everyone knows,"" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. 

         So-called ""classical"" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the ""loanable funds"" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. 

         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, ""In the long run we are all dead."" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by ""liquidity preference""--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. 

         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. 

         Consider, for example, the ""paradox of thrift."" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! 

         Or consider the ""widow's cruse"" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. 

         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. 

         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. 

          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. 

         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: ""It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!"") 

         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, ""Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (""Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,"" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. 

         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. 

          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. 

         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. 

         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. 

         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: 

                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. ""You need to stimulate the investment decision,"" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              

         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. 

         Am I missing something?

The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. 

         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. 

         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: 

                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. ""You need to stimulate the investment decision,"" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              

         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. 

         Am I missing something?

7,"I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the ""Capital of Europe,"" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: ""Taste you can trust."") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. 

         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. 

         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. 

          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. 

         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. 

         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. 

         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. 

         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. 

         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. 

          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. 

         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. 

         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest ""competence,"" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. 

         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like ""deputy director"" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. 

          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... 

         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.

8,"Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. 

         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? 

                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              

          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. 

         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the ""peculiar domestic institution"" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. 

         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. 

         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: ""At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs."" 

         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. 

          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was ""a bully pulpit,"" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, ""Let us ... ""--meaning, ""You do as I say."" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. 

         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. 

         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, ""Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,"" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, ""Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little."" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, ""In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation."" 

         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word ""women"" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase ""men and women,"" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. 

          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. ""Taxes,"" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: ""The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong."" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. 

         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls ""the supreme American problem."" The words ""black,"" ""blacks,"" ""Negro,"" or ""race"" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, ""On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?"" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer ""No one!""--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. 

         Before the Civil War the word ""slavery"" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the ""freedmen"" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, ""Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,"" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. 

         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: ""From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history."" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. 

         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.

8,"Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. 

         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? 

                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              

          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. 

         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the ""peculiar domestic institution"" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. 

         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. 

         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: ""At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs."" 

         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. 

          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was ""a bully pulpit,"" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, ""Let us ... ""--meaning, ""You do as I say."" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. 

         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. 

         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, ""Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,"" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, ""Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little."" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, ""In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation."" 

         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word ""women"" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase ""men and women,"" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. 

          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. ""Taxes,"" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: ""The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong."" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. 

         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls ""the supreme American problem."" The words ""black,"" ""blacks,"" ""Negro,"" or ""race"" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, ""On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?"" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer ""No one!""--as if there were not millions of slaves in America.

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. 

         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a ""fixed-point theorem"" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the ""fixed point."" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. 

         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for ""research and development""). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of ""smoothness"" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that ""impossible"" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. 

         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this ""genius with a penis."" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. 

         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). 

          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. ""Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,"" said one mathematician present. ""It was horrible."" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. 

         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--""I am the left foot of God on earth""--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. 

         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him ""the Phantom."" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: ""Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision."" 

         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. 

          Indeed, he has evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in ""insulbrick."") 

         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.

He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this ""genius with a penis."" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. 

         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). 

          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. ""Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,"" said one mathematician present. ""It was horrible."" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. 

         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--""I am the left foot of God on earth""--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. 

         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him ""the Phantom."" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: ""Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision."" 

         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. 

          Indeed, he has evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in ""insulbrick."") 

         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. 

         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a ""fixed-point theorem"" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the ""fixed point."" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. 

         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for ""research and development""). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of ""smoothness"" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that ""impossible"" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. 

         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems.

A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a ""fixed-point theorem"" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the ""fixed point."" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. 

         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for ""research and development""). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of ""smoothness"" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that ""impossible"" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. 

         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this ""genius with a penis."" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. 

         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). 

          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. ""Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,"" said one mathematician present. ""It was horrible."" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. 

         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--""I am the left foot of God on earth""--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. 

         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him ""the Phantom."" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: ""Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision."" 

         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. 

          Indeed, he has evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in ""insulbrick."") 

         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. 

         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still.

11,"My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: ""I saw that your father had died,"" she wrote. ""He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?"" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. 

         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. 

         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. 

         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. 

         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. 

         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. 

         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. 

         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. 

         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. 

         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. 

         ""Loyalty."" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. 

         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. 

         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. 

         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of BolÃ­var and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. 

         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. 

         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. 

         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. 

         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) 

         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. 

         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. 

         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. 

         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. 

         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as ""Suvorov,"" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. 

         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called ""Route 29"") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled ""Only You"") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. 

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, ""Let's do it together. It'll take half as long."" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. 

         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. 

         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. 

         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. 

         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, ""Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax."" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.

11,"My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: ""I saw that your father had died,"" she wrote. ""He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?"" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. 

         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. 

         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. 

         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. 

         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. 

         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. 

         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. 

         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. 

         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. 

         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. 

         ""Loyalty."" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. 

         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. 

         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. 

         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of BolÃ­var and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. 

         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. 

         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. 

         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. 

         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) 

         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. 

         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. 

         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. 

         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. 

         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as ""Suvorov,"" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. 

         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called ""Route 29"") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled ""Only You"") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. 

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give.

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, ""Let's do it together. It'll take half as long."" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. 

         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. 

         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. 

         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. 

         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, ""Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax."" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.

         The game of biographical ""gotcha"" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not ""the parable of Palestinian identity"" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said ""grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members."" 

         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to ""spin"" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) 

         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. 

         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls ""the Palestinian Versailles."" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him ""The Professor of Terror."" New York magazine once called him ""Arafat's man in New York."" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special ""Money"" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be ""on the payroll of the PLO."" 

         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's ""Algiers Declaration"" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a ""two-state solution"" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. 

         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, ""bi-national"" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with ""the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence."" 

         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. 

         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for ""post-colonial"" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to ""the other""--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) ""must be represented"" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. 

         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses ""a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure."" 

         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. ""He is easily distracted"" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , ""answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol."" 

         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. 

         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing ""criticism over solidarity,"" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .

Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, ""bi-national"" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with ""the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence."" 

         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. 

         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for ""post-colonial"" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to ""the other""--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) ""must be represented"" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. 

         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses ""a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure."" 

         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. ""He is easily distracted"" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , ""answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol."" 

         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. 

         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing ""criticism over solidarity,"" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .

         The game of biographical ""gotcha"" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not ""the parable of Palestinian identity"" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said ""grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members."" 

         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to ""spin"" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) 

         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. 

         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls ""the Palestinian Versailles."" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him ""The Professor of Terror."" New York magazine once called him ""Arafat's man in New York."" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special ""Money"" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be ""on the payroll of the PLO."" 

         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's ""Algiers Declaration"" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a ""two-state solution"" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. 

         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands.

He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls ""the Palestinian Versailles."" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him ""The Professor of Terror."" New York magazine once called him ""Arafat's man in New York."" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special ""Money"" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be ""on the payroll of the PLO."" 

         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's ""Algiers Declaration"" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a ""two-state solution"" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. 

         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, ""bi-national"" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with ""the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence."" 

         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. 

         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for ""post-colonial"" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to ""the other""--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) ""must be represented"" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. 

         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses ""a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure."" 

         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. ""He is easily distracted"" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , ""answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol."" 

         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. 

         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing ""criticism over solidarity,"" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. 

         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found .

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters.

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. 

         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found .

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested.

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint.

         ""This is not another book about civility,"" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . ""Civility,"" she explains, suggests a ""veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast."" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because ""contentious public discourse"" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. 

         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: 

         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. 

         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. 

         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. 

         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. 

         Many issues are multisided. 

         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. 

         Don't fight over small issues. 

         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. 

         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. 

          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. 

         ""When there is a need to make others wrong,"" Tannen argues, ""the temptation is great to oversimplify"" and to ""seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours."" In her need to make the ""argument culture"" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of ""totalitarian countries"" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in ""ethnically motivated assaults"" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. 

         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's ""kick 'em when they're up"" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. 

         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been ""trained to overcome their resistance to kill"" by trying ""not to think of their opponents as human beings."" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. ""Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty."" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. 

          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists """" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: ""E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient."" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: ""Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time."" 

         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing ""disastrous consequences."" Partial-birth abortion is ""surely not"" a ""very important"" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican ""politics of obstruction"" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the ""broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed."" The ""view of government as the enemy"" isn't worth debating; it's just ""another troubling aspect of the argument culture."" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that ""right-wing talk radio"" deploys phrases ""similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era."" 

         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address ""is followed immediately by a Republican response,"" which ""weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders."" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton ""broke the spell"" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' ""sense of connection"" to ""our judicial system."" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was ""cruelly unfair,"" and the Whitewater investigation--led by ""a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president""--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, ""the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history."" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. ""The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,"" she writes. 

         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become ""a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights."" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: ""Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' "" Similarly, ""the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group."" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which ""typically features a single guest."" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) 

         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. ""The purpose of most cross-examinations"" is ""not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,"" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, ""the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination."" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because ""it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,"" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, ""Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence."" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? 

         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: 

         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. 

         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the ""cruelty of cross-examination."" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country.

She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, ""Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence."" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? 

         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: 

         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. 

         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the ""cruelty of cross-examination."" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country.

         ""This is not another book about civility,"" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . ""Civility,"" she explains, suggests a ""veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast."" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because ""contentious public discourse"" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. 

         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: 

         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. 

         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. 

         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. 

         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. 

         Many issues are multisided. 

         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. 

         Don't fight over small issues. 

         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. 

         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. 

          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. 

         ""When there is a need to make others wrong,"" Tannen argues, ""the temptation is great to oversimplify"" and to ""seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours."" In her need to make the ""argument culture"" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of ""totalitarian countries"" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in ""ethnically motivated assaults"" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. 

         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's ""kick 'em when they're up"" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. 

         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been ""trained to overcome their resistance to kill"" by trying ""not to think of their opponents as human beings."" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. ""Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty."" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. 

          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists """" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: ""E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient."" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: ""Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time."" 

         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing ""disastrous consequences."" Partial-birth abortion is ""surely not"" a ""very important"" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican ""politics of obstruction"" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the ""broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed."" The ""view of government as the enemy"" isn't worth debating; it's just ""another troubling aspect of the argument culture."" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that ""right-wing talk radio"" deploys phrases ""similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era."" 

         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address ""is followed immediately by a Republican response,"" which ""weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders."" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton ""broke the spell"" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' ""sense of connection"" to ""our judicial system."" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was ""cruelly unfair,"" and the Whitewater investigation--led by ""a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president""--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, ""the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history."" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. ""The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,"" she writes. 

         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become ""a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights."" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: ""Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' "" Similarly, ""the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group."" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which ""typically features a single guest."" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) 

         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. ""The purpose of most cross-examinations"" is ""not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,"" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, ""the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination."" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because ""it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,"" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, ""Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence.""

A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton ""broke the spell"" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' ""sense of connection"" to ""our judicial system."" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was ""cruelly unfair,"" and the Whitewater investigation--led by ""a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president""--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, ""the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history."" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. ""The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,"" she writes. 

         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become ""a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights."" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: ""Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' "" Similarly, ""the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group."" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which ""typically features a single guest."" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) 

         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. ""The purpose of most cross-examinations"" is ""not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,"" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, ""the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination."" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because ""it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,"" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, ""Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence."" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? 

         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: 

         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. 

         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the ""cruelty of cross-examination."" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country.

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what ""everyone knows,"" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. 

         So-called ""classical"" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the ""loanable funds"" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. 

         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, ""In the long run we are all dead."" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by ""liquidity preference""--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. 

         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. 

         Consider, for example, the ""paradox of thrift."" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! 

         Or consider the ""widow's cruse"" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. 

         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. 

         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. 

          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. 

         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: ""It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!"") 

         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, ""Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (""Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,"" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. 

         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. 

          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. 

         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. 

         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. 

         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: 

                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. ""You need to stimulate the investment decision,"" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              

         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. 

         Am I missing something?

Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (""Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,"" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing. 

         To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth (as opposed to the quite different, more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim), you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent--that it cannot, by lowering interest rates, ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment. 

          It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment. That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car. So what? I am able to adjust that pressure, and so my car's speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive. Similarly, Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely (the Fed can double the money supply in a day, if it wants to), and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go--end of story. 

         No, to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending (try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders) or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near-zero interest rate. The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s, when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one-tenth of 1 percent; it is an arguable claim right now for Japan, where interest rates are about 1 percent. (Actually, I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk, and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance. That, however, is a subject for another column.) But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive, thank you. 

         Anyway, this is a moot point, because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent. On the contrary, they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U.S. economy over the past generation is all the Fed's fault, and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us. 

         Let's quote the Feb. 3 Business                 Week commentary: 

                         Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy, depressing investment rather than sparking it. ""You need to stimulate the investment decision,"" says University of Texas economist James K. Galbraith, a Keynesian. He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates.              

         So, increasing savings will slow the economy--presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates. Instead, the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates, which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment. 

         Am I missing something?

15,"Vulgar Keynesians 

         Economics, like all intellectual enterprises, is subject to the law of diminishing disciples. A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license. If his ideas are at first somewhat rough, if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before, no matter: Polish and perspective can come in due course. But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator's ideas but misunderstand their spirit, who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy. And as ideas spread, they become increasingly simplistic--until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness, part of what ""everyone knows,"" is no more than a crude caricature of the original. 

         Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics. John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought--call it vulgar Keynesianism--that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day. 

         Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. But macroeconomics --the study of economy-wide events like inflation and deflation, booms and slumps--was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression. 

         So-called ""classical"" macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long-run tendency to return to full employment, and focused only on that long run. Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the ""loanable funds"" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. 

         Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, ""In the long run we are all dead."" In the short run, he asserted, interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by ""liquidity preference""--the public's desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets. Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output. In particular, if investment demand should fall for whatever reason--such as, say, a stock-market crash--the result would be an economy-wide slump. 

         It was a brilliant re-imagining of the way the economy worked, one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time. True, some realized very early that Keynes' picture was oversimplified; in particular, that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates, and that this might make a lot of difference. Still, for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory , many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture, which seemed to take us into a looking-glass world in which virtue was punished and self-indulgence rewarded. 

         Consider, for example, the ""paradox of thrift."" Suppose that for some reason the savings rate--the fraction of income not spent--goes up. According to the early Keynesian models, this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment. Why? Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump, which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand; since in the end savings and investment are always equal, the total volume of savings must actually fall! 

         Or consider the ""widow's cruse"" theory of wages and employment (named after an old folk tale). You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor; but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand, because workers save less than capitalists (actually they don't, but that's another story), and therefore increase output and employment. 

         Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate; they still appear in some freshman textbooks. Nonetheless, few economists take them seriously these days. There are a number of reasons, but the most important can be stated in two words: Alan Greenspan. 

         After all, the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. You may quarrel with the Fed chairman's judgment--you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein--but you can hardly dispute his power. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. 

          But putting Greenspan (or his successor) into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy. Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run, we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. And so all the paradoxes of thrift, widow's cruses, and so on become irrelevant. In particular, an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all, because the Fed will make sure that it does. 

         To me, at least, the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy--so that they will, on average, have no effect on employment--seems both simple and entirely reasonable. Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way. For example, the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness. (In fact, when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993, a fellow panelist--a NAFTA advocate, as it happens--exploded in rage: ""It's remarks like that that make people hate economists!"") 

         What has made it into the public consciousness--including, alas, that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed--is a sort of caricature Keynesianism, the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing. In the United States, where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being, vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback. The paradox of thrift and the widow's cruse are both major themes in William Greider's latest book, which I discussed last month. (Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas--as Keynes wrote, ""Practical men, who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist."") It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B. Judis in the ; but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in (""Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places,"" Feb. 3), you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing.

16,"I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the ""Capital of Europe,"" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: ""Taste you can trust."") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. 

         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. 

         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. 

          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. 

         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. 

         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. 

         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. 

         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. 

         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. 

          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. 

         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. 

         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest ""competence,"" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. 

         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like ""deputy director"" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. 

          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... 

         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.

Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. 

         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy. Last year, the Belgian secretary-general of NATO had to quit over charges that his Flemish Socialist Party accepted $50 million in bribes from a defense contractor. Police recently arrested two other top politicians and raided the headquarters of the French Socialist Party in connection with bribes from another defense firm. 

         The European Union's Eurocrats have worthy ideas, such as persuading the continent's governments to agree on harmonious environmental and immigration policies. But the real overriding goal of the union and its executive arm, the European Commission (there's also a European Parliament here, but we can skip that), is self-aggrandizement. In conversations, Eurocrats are frank about their maneuvering for more money and empire: to wrest ""competence,"" or jurisdiction, away from national governments and vest it in Brussels is the open objective. 

         The union's command center is a cathedral to bureaucratic power, the only diplomatic structure I've ever been in that actually looks the way Hollywood depicts diplomatic life. At State Department headquarters in Foggy Bottom, paint is peeling in the halls and people with titles like ""deputy director"" work in chintzy little Dilbert cubicles. At the marble-clad European Union headquarters, even midlevel Eurocrats have large, plush suites with leather chairs and original artwork on the walls. Ranks of big black-glass BMWs and Mercedes limos are parked at the structure's circular drive, motors wastefully idling. Landing a job in the Brussels Eurocracy has become the career goal of many of Europe's best graduates. 

          The European Union's behavior synchs with its opulent circumstances. Meetings are held in secret, and few public-disclosure regulations apply. This is the future of European government? Just how competent the new organization may be is on display at Berlaymont, the first European Commission headquarters. Forerunner of the current sumptuous building, this vast skyscraper now sits near the center of Brussels unoccupied, its entire outer structure swathed in heavy tarpaulin. Berlaymont has been closed for nine years after an asbestos scare and a botched cleanup: European taxpayers have paid $50 million so far merely to keep the building closed, with air pumps running around the clock to prevent any fibers from wafting out. A mountain of scientific studies has shown that asbestos in walls is almost never dangerous: The only dangerous thing is trying to rip it out because that causes fibers to become airborne--exactly what has happened at Berlaymont. And if the European Union can't manage its continent any better than it manages its own buildings ... 

         Fortunately, Berlaymont isn't in my neighborhood, but a patisserie is. Bakeries are easier to find than gas stations in Brussels, and the neon bakery sign I can see from my office window often calls out to me the way signs for cocktail lounges once called out to earlier generations of writers. Think I'll answer now.

16,"I Have Seen the Future of Europe 

         The Eurocrats were thinking ahead when they made Brussels the ""Capital of Europe,"" headquarters of the emerging European Union. Though practically unknown in the United States, the union is one of Europe's biggest stories, an important organization trying to establish itself as a sort of metagovernment for European states. Entertainingly, the European Union is perhaps the sole bureaucracy left in the world that admits that its goal is to expand. And what better place to locate this new enterprise than Brussels, which may be a living preview of the Europe to come: swathed in red tape and pomp, paralyzed by constituency politics, declining at great cost. The European Union couldn't have picked a better home. 

         Belgian politics enjoy none of the rowdy intellectual contention of the United Kingdom, none of the nuance-loving literary polemics of France, not even a strong national identity. The primary issue in public debate is who gets what benefits, and while commerce and money are gods, neither is served particularly well. The national infrastructure is fraying, with little renewal: Belgians have a high per-capita income and spend it generously on cars and dining, but what Rousseau called the esprit social seems lacking. Crumbling, generic, enervated, debt-ridden, materialistic ... is this Europe's future? 

         Brussels is a place where you can take your dog into a restaurant, but not your kids. Where a best-selling product, in an ostensibly Catholic country, is Judas beer. (My proposed slogan: ""Taste you can trust."") Where there's no such thing as takeout coffee with lids. Anyone who wants coffee must sit languidly in a cafe, gradually feeling overcome with lethargy and despair. 

         Other European atmospherics: lobster bisque for sale from sidewalk vendors; excellent public transportation; monumental traffic jams of expensive cars crowding small streets; bare breasts common in advertisements and at beaches, miniskirts being considered acceptable attire for professional women (when, oh when will these enlightened attitudes reach the United States?); notably more pollution than in the United States; notably more government, running higher deficits; lots of well-cared-for historic buildings, such as the built-in-the-14 th -century church I attend with my family; prices far too high, except for wine and flowers, which are cheap (European staples, you know); large cemeteries, where thousands of U.S. soldiers rest beneath uniform stone markers; and ubiquitous fresh bread and great chocolates. 

         Many tongues are spoken here, but multilingualism serves mainly to delineate constituent groups, not to facilitate communication. Southern Belgium, called Wallonia, is French; the northern portion, Flanders, is Dutch. The civic sphere is entirely bilingual, down to abbreviations: Buses and trams are brightly labeled MIVB/STIB, the transit-agency acronyms in French and Flemish. But bilingualism doesn't seem to do much to bring people together. In the Flemish parts of town, most people would rather hear English than French, and in the French sections, Flemish is rarely welcome. Until recently, Belgian politics were dominated by an aging Francophone aristocracy, whose wealth was secured by Wallonian mines. But mining is a dying industry throughout Europe, and Wallonia now produces only 13 percent of Belgium's exports, vs. 68 percent for Flanders. The Flemish have jumped into electronics, trading, and other growth sectors, while the Walloons have stagnated, devoting their energies to demanding more benefits. Their economic power on the rise, the Flemish have pressured for a dominant position in politics. The result is an uneasy compromise giving Flanders and Wallonia semiautonomy. 

          Public strikes, particularly ones blocking traffic and commerce, are a regular event here, making it somewhat of a mystery how Belgium maintains its high living standard. In the past year, teachers, students, firefighters, civil servants, airline workers, and others have closed off large sections of Brussels to chant for higher benefits. Ground crews for Sabena, the national flag carrier, ran amok during a 1996 strike day at the airport, smashing the terminal's glass walls and doing millions of francs worth of damage, then demanding more money from the very government that was going to have to pay for the repairs. 

         What are the protesters striking about? Typical working conditions in Belgium include retirement at 60 or younger, full pay for 32 hours of work, six weeks' paid vacation, and essentially unlimited sick days. Much more than high wages (which a profitable enterprise can bear), such work rules are what stymie the continent's economies, with overall Western European unemployment now at 10.9 percent, double the U.S. figure. 

         Yet, sympathy is usually with strikers, and cowed politicians give in to almost all demands from almost all quarters. Polls repeatedly show that majorities think government should give the workers more, a legacy of the European class system. Europe is plagued by families that have been filthy rich for generations--based on no useful contribution to society. And a residue of estates reminds voters of the landed gentry's historic role as parasites. But the link between government giving the workers more, and taxes and public debt rising, does not seem to have sunk in on this side of the Atlantic, except perhaps in the United Kingdom, where, perhaps not coincidentally, unemployment is relatively low. 

         As in most of Europe, state-sanctioned monopolies drag down Belgian economic activity, and government barriers to entrepreneurs are much worse than anywhere in America. Sabena loses money even though it has government-protected air routes, a high percentage of business flyers, and the highest seat-mile prices in Europe. 

         The ossified state of European telecom monopolies would stun American Webheads. One reason Slate is not a national obsession in Europe (as, of course, it is in the United States) is that Internet use remains a luxury here. The phone monopolies have priced out 800 access. Belgacom charges 5 cents per minute for connections to any Internet service provider, making the connection more expensive than the provider's service. Ten years ago Robert Reich, having seen the French Minitel experiment, warned that Europe would beat the United States to the next communication revolution--instead, U.S. Web entrepreneurs left Europe in the dust. Now European telecoms and communication bureaucrats spend their energies on blocking innovation and searching for ways to monopolize a new enterprise whose entire soul is decentralization. 

         These rapacious European phone monopolies have given birth to independent call-back services. Once registered, you dial a number in the United States, where a computer with caller-ID recognizes you after one ring. You hang up to avoid a Belgacom charge, and the computer calls you back, providing you with a stateside dial tone so you can dial as if you were in the United States. Call-back services allow me to call the United States for 70 cents a minute, vs. the $2.60-per-minute Belgacom charge, and make it cheaper to call Antwerp--just 40 miles away--via California than directly. Naturally, European governments want to tax call-back services out of existence. Supposedly, the European telecom market will deregulate in 1999, and in anticipation of being phaser-blasted by true competition, Belgacom just sold 45 percent of itself to a consortium led by Ameritech. Foreign managers will now be blamed for cutting the deadwood. 

          In a sense, all European governments are angling to shift the blame for financial reality onto someone else via the euro. In theory, national currencies such as the pound, mark, and lira will all disappear, replaced by one universal tender. A unified currency makes economic sense, but trade efficiency is only one motive for many governments. Participation in the new currency requires nations to cut their national debt below 3 percent of GDP. A dirty little secret of Western Europe is that it has gone further into hock than the United States. U.S. public debt was down to 1.4 percent of GDP in 1996, and may drop below 1 percent this fiscal year. Germany, France, and Belgium all are running public debts at 3 percent or more, and Italy is at 7.4 percent. European national leaders know they've got to tackle their deficits, but none of them wants the heat for cutting featherbedding or generous social-payment systems. So the euro plan allows them to blame foreign interests for required reductions. 

         But will the spooky level of Belgian corruption rub off on the euro? Observers consider Belgium the second-most corrupt European state, trailing only Italy.

17,"Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. 

         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? 

                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              

          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. 

         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the ""peculiar domestic institution"" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. 

         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. 

         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: ""At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs."" 

         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. 

          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was ""a bully pulpit,"" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, ""Let us ... ""--meaning, ""You do as I say."" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. 

         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. 

         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, ""Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,"" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, ""Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little."" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, ""In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation."" 

         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany. But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word ""women"" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase ""men and women,"" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. 

          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. ""Taxes,"" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: ""The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong."" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. 

         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls ""the supreme American problem."" The words ""black,"" ""blacks,"" ""Negro,"" or ""race"" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, ""On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?"" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer ""No one!""--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. 

         Before the Civil War the word ""slavery"" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the ""freedmen"" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, ""Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,"" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. 

         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: ""From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history."" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. 

         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.

But what is most amazing, at least to a reader in 1997, is the silence of the inaugurals on the subject of women. The word ""women"" does not appear at all until Wilson's first inaugural, and it always appears as part of the phrase ""men and women,"" never as referring to any special concerns of women. Even Harding, the first president to be chosen in an election in which women voted nationally, does not remark on the uniqueness of the fact in his inaugural. 

          One subject that does get ample treatment is taxes. ""Taxes,"" or some equivalent word, appears in 43 of the 52 inaugural addresses to date. Coolidge said in 1925: ""The time is arriving when we can have further tax reduction. ... I am opposed to extremely high rates, because they produce little or no revenue, because they are bad for the country, and, finally, because they are wrong."" Federal taxes were then about 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Ronald Reagan said essentially the same thing in 1981, when they were 20 percent. 

         The most disturbing aspect of the whole series of inaugurals is what is said and unsaid on the subject of race relations, which Arthur Schlesinger Jr. calls ""the supreme American problem."" The words ""black,"" ""blacks,"" ""Negro,"" or ""race"" (as applied to blacks) do not appear at all until Rutherford Hayes, 1877. James Monroe asked in 1817, ""On whom has oppression fallen in any quarter of our Union? Who has been deprived of any right of person or property?"" These were rhetorical questions, intended to get the answer ""No one!""--as if there were not millions of slaves in America. 

         Before the Civil War the word ""slavery"" appears only in the Inaugural Address of Martin Van Buren, 1837, and Buchanan, 1857, and then only as something that, pursuant to the Constitution and in order to preserve the Union, should not be interfered with. But although generally unmentionable, the subject was boiling, and would boil over in 1861. After the Civil War, it is in the inaugurals of Hayes, James Garfield (1881), and Benjamin Harrison (1889) that we find the most explicit and positive discussion of the need to convert into reality the rights and freedom granted to the ""freedmen"" on paper by the 13 th , 14 th , and 15 th amendments. Garfield's was the strongest among these. (He had been a student at Williams College in the 1850s, 80 years before me, when the college had been a station on the underground railway.) But the subject then began to fade. William McKinley said in his first Inaugural Address, March 4, 1897, ""Lynchings must not be tolerated in a great and civilized country like the United States,"" but he said it without horror. Taft raised the subject of race relations in 1909 only to express satisfaction at the progress that had been made. And then the subject disappeared. FDR never mentioned it in any of his four inaugurals. 

         After World War II the subject came back to inaugural addresses, but in a weak and abstract form. That is true even of the presidents we think of as being most concerned with race relations in America--like Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, and Bill Clinton. Perhaps each thought he had made a sufficient statement by having a black woman--Marian Anderson, Leontyne Price, or Maya Angelou--perform at his ceremony. In Clinton's first inaugural, the only allusion to the race problem is in this sentence: ""From our revolution, the Civil War, to the Great Depression to the civil rights movement, our people have always mustered the determination to construct from these crises the pillars of our history."" I recall this not to suggest that their concern was not deep and sincere, but only to indicate what is acceptable to say in a speech intended to appeal to the values shared by Americans. 

         There is much more to ponder in these speeches than I have suggested here. There is much to be proud of, in what we have endured and achieved, in the peaceful transference of power, and in the reasonableness and moderation of the presidents we have elected. But there is also much humility to be learned. We look back with amazement at the ignorance and moral obtuseness revealed by what our past leaders have said and our past citizens believed. We should recognize that 50 or 100 years from now, readers will shake their heads at what we are saying and believing today.

17,"Reading the Inaugurals 

         President Clinton's Inaugural Address this month is the 53 rd in the series that began in 1789. All are worth a read--not just the highlights, such as George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and FDR. They will give you a feeling of being there, not as an omniscient historian of 1997 looking back at 1837 or 1897 but as an ordinary citizen who shares--and is limited by--the information, the concerns, and the values of those times. (Thanks to Columbia University, all the addresses can be found on the Web.) 

         Among all the past presidents and their speech writers there was only one literary genius: Lincoln. After 132 years, his second inaugural still brings tears to your eyes and chills your blood. None of the other inaugural addresses are in that league. But by and large they are dignified and intelligent speeches given by articulate men, each in touch with his times and aware that his inauguration was the most solemn occasion of his life. 

         The stance and style of the inaugurals seem to have gone through three phases. The first, lasting until Lincoln, was that of the modest, classic public servant. The second, lasting through William Howard Taft, was of the prosaic government executive. The third, in which we are still, is the phase of the assertive, theatrical leader-preacher. This classification is not waterproof. Theodore Roosevelt may belong in the third phase and Warren G. Harding-Calvin Coolidge-Herbert Hoover in the second. But the trend is clear. 

         On picking up Washington's first inaugural, one is immediately struck by the modesty. He had just been elected unanimously by the Electoral College. He was more respected than any subsequent president has been at the time of his inauguration. And what does he say? 

                         [T]he magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my country called me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens a distrustful scrutiny into his qualifications, could not but overwhelm with despondence one who (inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpracticed in the duties of civil administration) ought to be peculiarly conscious of his own deficiencies.              

          None of his successors has made the point as forcefully as that. But echoes are to be found in almost every president for the next 68 years. (John Adams was an exception. He was apparently so envious of Washington that he spent a large part of his address spelling out his own excellent qualifications for the job.) That era ended with Lincoln. Subsequent inaugurals routinely contain protestations of humility, but they are perfunctory and do not sound sincere. 

         The antebellum modesty, while in part a reflection of the conventional etiquette of the time, may also have served a political objective: to alleviate the concerns of those who--in the early days of the republic--feared it might be transformed into a monarchy, and the president into a king. A little later, perhaps after 1820, a new worry arose. Would the power of the federal government be used to interfere with the ""peculiar domestic institution"" of the Southern states? The presidents' assurance of the limitation of their powers may have been intended to give comfort to those states. 

         Lincoln faced a different situation. With the South already seceding, he could only ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"" by asserting the power of the federal government and his own power as chief executive. It was no time for modesty. Lincoln's successors inherited a federal government with much more authority--and more need to use it--than before the war, and they had less motivation to belittle themselves and their powers. 

         In the third phase, the Inaugural Address metamorphosed from describing the government's policy to inspiring the public's behavior. Presidents recognized--or, at least, believed--that the country had problems they ought to deal with but could not manage by using the instruments of government alone. Thus, in his first inaugural, Woodrow Wilson said: ""At last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole. We see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and the vital. With this vision we approach new affairs."" 

         If the country is debased and decadent, the cure has to come from uplifting the people, not from acts of government. Similar diagnoses and prescriptions appear in later inaugurals. 

          Presidents derived their license to serve as leader-preacher from Theodore Roosevelt's remark that the presidency was ""a bully pulpit,"" a remark that did not appear in his Inaugural Address. The metaphor of the pulpit suggests not reading but oral and visual contact between the preacher and his flock. Radio and--even more--television made this possible on a national scale. A telltale sign of the leader-preacher inaugural is the use of the phrase, ""Let us ... ""--meaning, ""You do as I say."" This expression appears occasionally throughout the history of inaugurals, but it has hit its stride in recent years. John F. Kennedy repeated it 16 times in his Inaugural Address, and Richard Nixon has it 22 times in his second one. 

         The change in literary style from classical to colloquial can be demonstrated by one statistic. In all the inaugurals from Washington through James Buchanan, the average number of words per sentence was 44. From Lincoln to Wilson it was 34, and since Wilson it has been 25. I do not consider this a deterioration (this article has an average of 17 words per sentence), but it does reflect the change in the size and character of the audience and in the means of communication. William Henry Harrison could talk about the governments of Athens, Rome, and the Helvetic Confederacy and expect his audience to know what he was talking about. That wouldn't be true today. But Harrison's audience would not have known what the Internet was. 

         Presidents and their speech writers have mined their predecessors for memorable words and repeated them without attribution. Kennedy's trumpet call, ""Ask not what your country can do for you: Ask what you can do for your country,"" has an ironic history. In his inaugural, Harding, surely no model for Kennedy, had said, ""Our most dangerous tendency is to expect too little of government, and at the same time do for it too little."" And even before he became president, in a speech in 1916, Harding had said, ""In the great fulfillment we must have a citizenship less concerned about what the government can do for it and more anxious about what it can do for the nation."" 

         Many an issue frets its hour on the inaugural stage and then is heard no more. That includes the Indians, the coastal fortifications, territorial expansion, the Isthmus Canal, civil-service reform, polygamy, and Prohibition. Some subjects that you expect to appear, don't. Hoover's inaugural, March 4, 1929, gives no hint of economic vulnerability. Roosevelt's second inaugural, Jan. 20, 1937, contains no reference to Hitler or to Germany.

",8,What does the author think about inaugural speech writers compared with the delivering presidents?,3,The subject is not covered,1,The writers are highly applauded
18,"Folie ࠎ 

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. 

         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a ""fixed-point theorem"" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the ""fixed point."" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. 

         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for ""research and development""). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of ""smoothness"" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that ""impossible"" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. 

         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this ""genius with a penis."" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. 

         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). 

          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. ""Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,"" said one mathematician present. ""It was horrible."" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. 

         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--""I am the left foot of God on earth""--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. 

         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him ""the Phantom."" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: ""Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision."" 

         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. 

          Indeed, he has evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in ""insulbrick."") 

         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being. 

         As a boy growing up in the hills of West Virginia, Nash enjoyed torturing animals and building homemade bombs with two other unpopular youngsters, one of whom was accidentally killed by a blast. (Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still.

(Given Nash's childhood keenness for explosives and his later penchant for sending odd packages to prominent strangers through the mail, it's a wonder the FBI never got on to him as a Unabomber suspect.) He made his way to Carnegie Tech, where he was a classmate of Andy Warhol's, and thence to Princeton--the world capital of mathematics at the time--at the age of 20. 

         In sheer appearance, this cold and aloof Southerner stood out from his fellow math prodigies. A ""beautiful dark-haired young man,"" ""handsome as a god,"" he was 6 feet 1 inch tall, with broad shoulders, a heavily muscled chest (which he liked to show off with see-through Dacron shirts), a tapered waist, and ""rather limp and beautiful hands"" accentuated by long fingernails. Within two years of entering Princeton, Nash had framed and proved the most important proposition in the theory of games. 

          Mathematically, this was no big deal. Game theory was a somewhat fashionable pursuit for mathematicians in those postwar days, when it looked as if it might do for military science and economics what Newton's calculus had done for physics. But they were bored with it by the early 1950s. Economists, after a few decades of hesitation, picked it up in the '80s and made it a cornerstone of their discipline. 

          Agame is just a conflict situation with a bunch of participants, or ""players."" The players could be poker pals, oligopolists competing to corner a market, or nuclear powers trying to dominate each other. Each player has several strategy options to choose from. What Nash showed was that in every such game there is what has become known as a ""Nash equilibrium"": a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve his situation by switching to a different strategy. His proof was elegant but slight. A game is guaranteed to have a Nash equilibrium, it turns out, for the same reason that in a cup of coffee that is being stirred, at least one coffee molecule must remain absolutely still. Both are direct consequences of a ""fixed-point theorem"" in the branch of mathematics known as topology. This theorem says that for any continuous rearrangement of a domain of things, there will necessarily exist at least one thing in that domain that will remain unchanged--the ""fixed point."" Nash found a way of applying this to the domain of all game strategies so that the guaranteed fixed point was the equilibrium for the game--clever, but the earlier topological theorem did all the work. Still, for an economics theorem, that counts as profound. Economists have been known to win Nobel Prizes for rediscovering theorems in elementary calculus. 

         Nash's breakthrough in game theory got him recruited by the Rand Corp., which was then a secretive military think tank in Santa Monica (its name is an acronym for ""research and development""). However, the achievement did not greatly impress his fellow mathematicians. To do that, Nash, on a wager, disposed of a deep problem that had baffled the profession since the 19 th century: He showed that any Riemannian manifold possessing a special kind of ""smoothness"" can be embedded in Euclidean space. Manifolds, one must understand, are fairly wild and exotic beasts in mathematics. A famous example is the Klein bottle, a kind of higher-dimensional Moebius strip whose inside is somehow the same as its outside. Euclidean space, by contrast, is orderly and bourgeois. To demonstrate that ""impossible"" manifolds could be coaxed into living in Euclidean space is counterintuitive and pretty exciting. Nash did this by constructing a bizarre set of inequalities that left his fellow mathematicians thoroughly befuddled. 

         That about marked the end of Nash's career as a mathematical genius. The next year, he was expelled from Rand as a security risk after local police caught him engaging in a lewd act in a public men's room near Muscle Beach. At MIT, where he had been given a teaching job, he hardly bothered with undergraduates and humiliated graduate students by solving their thesis problems. He carried on affairs with several men and a mistress, who bore him a son he refused to lift a finger to support. His cruel streak extended to the woman he married, a beautiful physics student named Alicia who was awed by this ""genius with a penis."" Once, at a math department picnic, he threw her to the ground and put his foot on her throat. 

         All the while, Nash was showing an intense interest in the state of Israel--often a sign of incipient insanity, at least in a non-Jew. Geniuses slipping into madness also tend to disrobe in public (I learned this from a volume on chess prodigies, who have a proclivity for disrobing on public buses). Nash showed up for an MIT New Year's Eve party clad only in a diaper. And then, of course, there was the New York Times , that old mainstay of psychotic delusion--Nash thought aliens were sending him encrypted messages through its pages (come to think of it, that could explain the Times ' odd prose). 

          When the big breakdown came, it was properly mathematical. Fearing his powers might be waning as he approached 30, Nash decided he would solve the most important unresolved problem in mathematics: the Riemann Zeta conjecture. This bold guess about the solutions to a certain complex-valued infinite series (made by the incomparable Bernhard Riemann in 1859) would, if true, have far-reaching implications for the structure of the most basic of entities, the natural numbers. Before an eager audience of hundreds of mathematicians at Columbia University in 1959, Nash presented his results: a farrago of mathematical lunacy. ""Nash's talk wasn't good or bad,"" said one mathematician present. ""It was horrible."" Some weeks before, Nash had declined a University of Chicago offer of an endowed chair on the grounds that he was scheduled to become the emperor of Antarctica. 

         Such ebullitions of insanity continued for three decades, becoming more rococo. Nash went to Europe to form a world government, attempting repeatedly to renounce his U.S. citizenship. He did stints in tony asylums, hanging out with Robert Lowell, and in dismal state institutions, where he was subjected daily to insulin-induced comas. He believed himself to be a Palestinian refugee called C.O.R.P.S.E.; a great Japanese shogun, C1423; Esau; the prince of peace; l'homme d'Or ; a mouse. As Nasar observes, his delusions were weirdly inconsistent. He felt himself simultaneously to be the epicenter of the universe--""I am the left foot of God on earth""--and an abject, persecuted petitioner. 

         He returned to the Princeton area in the 1970s, where he was taken care of by the long-suffering Alicia, now his ex-wife (she supported him partly through computer programming, partly on welfare). He haunted the campus, where students began to call him ""the Phantom."" They would come to class in the morning to find runic messages he had written on the blackboard at night: ""Mao Tse-Tung's Bar Mitzvah was 13 years, 13 months, and 13 days after Brezhnev's circumcision."" 

         Then, in the '90s, inexplicably, the voices in Nash's head began to quiet down. (Nasar gives an interesting account of just how rare such remissions are among those diagnosed with schizophrenia.) At the same time, the Nobel committee in Stockholm was deciding it was about time to award the prize in economics for game theory. Dare they make a known madman into a laureate? What might he say to King Gustav at the ceremony? Nasar shows her mettle as a reporter here by penetrating the veil of secrecy surrounding the Nobel and revealing the back-stage machinations for and against Nash's candidacy. He did fine at the ceremony, by the way. 

          Indeed, he has evolved into a ""very fine person,"" according to his ex-wife--humbled by years of psychotic helplessness, buoyed up by the intellectual world's highest accolade. The Nobel has a terrible effect on the productivity of many recipients, paralyzing them with greatness. For Nash it was pure therapy. Then, too, there is the need to take care of his son by Alicia, who--pleiotropically?--inherited both his mathematical promise and his madness. (His older son, the one born out of wedlock, got neither.) The Nobel money bought a new boiler for the little bungalow across from the Princeton train station inhabited by this shaky menage. (When Vanity Fair published an excerpt of A Beautiful Mind , Nash probably became the only person ever featured in that magazine to live in a house clad in ""insulbrick."") 

         The eeriest thing I discovered while reading this superb book was that Nash and I came within a couple of years of crossing paths in a Virginia mental hospital. I was actually working there, but psychiatric aides pick up so many mannerisms of the patients that it's hard to tell the difference after a while. A few years after that I found myself in a mathematics Ph.D. program. You'll be glad to know that I'm in remission.

         People with high IQs tend to be nearsighted. This is not because they read a lot or stare at computer screens too much. That common-sense hypothesis has been discredited by research. Rather, it is a matter of genetics. The same genes that tend to elevate IQ also tend to affect the shape of the eyeball in a way that leads to myopia. This relationship--known in genetics as ""pleiotropy""--seems to be completely accidental, a quirk of evolution. 

         Could there be a similar pleiotropy between madness and mathematics? Reading this absolutely fascinating biography by Sylvia Nasar, an economics writer for the New York Times , I began to wonder. Its subject, John Nash, is a mathematical genius who went crazy at the age of 30 and then, after several decades of flamboyant lunacy, was awarded the Nobel Prize in economics for something he had discovered as a graduate student. (He is now about to turn 70.) Nash is among the latest in a long and distinguished line of mathematicians--stretching back to that morbid paranoiac, Isaac Newton--who have been certifiably insane during parts of their lives. 

         Just in the last 100 years or so, most of the heroic figures in the foundations of mathematics have landed in mental asylums or have died by their own hand. The greatest of them, Kurt Gödel, starved himself to death in the belief that his colleagues were putting poison in his food. Of the two pioneers of game theory--the field in which Nash garnered his Nobel--one, Ernst Zermelo, was hospitalized for psychosis. The other, John Von Neumann, may not have been clinically insane, but he did serve as the real-life model for the title character in Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove . 

         So maybe there is an accidental, pleiotropic connection between madness and mathematics. Or maybe it isn't so accidental. Mathematicians are, after all, people who fancy that they commune with perfect Platonic objects--abstract spaces, infinite numbers, zeta functions--that are invisible to normal humans. They spend their days piecing together complicated, scrupulously logical tales about these hallucinatory entities, which they believe are vastly more important than anything in the actual world. Is this not a kind of a folie à n (where n equals the number of pure mathematicians worldwide)? 

          ABeautiful Mind reveals quite a lot about the psychic continuum leading from mathematical genius to madness. It is also a very peculiar redemption story: how three decades of raging schizophrenia, capped by an unexpected Nobel Prize, can transmute a cruel shit into a frail but decent human being.

         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture. All but three (Wrigley Field, Fenway Park, and Tiger Stadium) have since been razed. 

          Replacing parks built of wood, these ballyards set new standards for size, fire safety, intimacy, and convenience. As places to watch ballgames, they were vastly superior to the post-World War II parks, especially the facilities designed in the late '60s and '70s that doubled as football stadiums. But these concrete monsters, plopped into vast parking lots in Houston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and elsewhere, lack the character of the classic parks. 

         Chicago's New Comiskey Park, which opened in 1991, attempted to address the character question with a superficial postmodern facade that in some ways resembled the exterior of the golden-era park it replaced. New Comiskey was marketed as an old-fashioned park with all the modern conveniences. But inside, it was still a symmetrical concrete monster, and it sat in the middle of a 7,000-car parking lot rather than in an urban neighborhood. 

         A year later, a new--yet more genuinely old--ballpark arrived to dispel the gloom. Baltimore's Oriole Park at Camden Yards revived the idea of a quirkily asymmetrical, relatively intimate, steel-structured, city-friendly ballpark. ""Once this opens,"" predicted Commissioner of Baseball Bart Giamatti, ""everyone will want one like it."" And so it came to be: Camden Yards' successors in Cleveland, Arlington (Texas), and Denver, and those designed for Milwaukee, Seattle, and San Francisco, take their cues from Baltimore's conceptual breakthrough. Even totally nontraditional parks, like those in Phoenix, Miami, and Tampa Bay, emulate the asymmetry of the Camden Yards outfield. It's almost as though a disembodied voice intoned, ""If you build it, they will copy."" 

         While Camden Yards and its offspring are almost universally praised, some of them don't deserve the hype. The most annoying hype is that all the new parks are intimate, and that every seat is better at the new place than the old. Intimacy has two aspects--actual size and the subjective perception of size and scale. A good architect can ace the second part of the test through convincing forms, good proportions, and attractive materials. The exposed steelwork, brick, stone, tile, and well-placed wall openings of the new parks beat the cold and sterile stadiums of a generation ago. 

         For the new parks' charms, we should be thankful. But in actual size, the new ballyards are not intimate. All their amenities--elevators, wider concourses, abundant toilets (especially for women), bathrooms, escalators, plentiful food stands, and luxury suites--make them far larger than the parks they claim to emulate. These parks are larger than even the multipurpose hulks we all love to hate. Compare, for instance, the spanking new Ballpark at Arlington (49,100 seats), which rests on 13.6 acres, to Seattle's Kingdome, a 58,000-seat multipurpose stadium that opened in 1976 and covers 9.3 acres. (Ebbets Field, home to the Brooklyn Dodgers, occupied a mere 5.7 acres and seated 32,000.) 

         Or compare heights: New Comiskey Park's roof is 146 feet above field level; old Comiskey Park was about 75 feet high. This is not ballpark trivia, but an indicator of fan experience: Upper-deck seats in the new, taller stadiums are farther away from the action. At Arlington, the fan sitting in the middle-row, upper-deck seat closest to home plate is 224 feet from the batter, compared to 125 feet at Tiger Stadium, a park with 4,300 more seats. 

         Why are upper-deck seats in the new parks so far from the game? Two reasons: column placement and luxury seating. 

         In the old parks, the structural columns stood within the seating areas, placing the upper-deck seats closer to the game. The trade-off was that these columns obstructed the view of some fans. Today's architects ""remedy"" the problem by placing the columns behind the seating areas, thus moving the upper decks back from the field. (It should be noted that the new parks' claim that they have no impaired-view seats is an overstatement.) 

         Added tiers devoted to luxury seating at the new parks also push the upper deck away from the field. The retreat of that deck is a century-long process, but it can be stemmed. The Orioles pressed for several design changes that lowered Camden Yards' top deck and produced a middle-row viewing distance of 199 feet, about eight rows closer than Arlington's. 

         Design references to golden-age ballparks are only one parallel between that period and ours. We are also matching that era's frenzied pace of construction: Twenty-six of Major League Baseball's 32 franchises occupy a park that is less than 10 years old; has been, or will be, extensively remodeled; or hope to move into a new one soon. 

         One of the classic parks' merits was that they were unsubsidized. Team owners bought land and paid for stadium construction--some even built trolley lines to transport fans to the games. In all but two cases during the last 65 years, taxpayers have covered most or all of the costs of stadium building. 

         The San Francisco Giants are planning a similar arrangement for their bayfront stadium, assembling about $240 million in private funds and persuading the city to pay for some of the infrastructure. The Giants say that other team owners are rooting against their scheme, because it calls into question the profligate public subsidies. Some of the subsidies exceed capital and maintenance costs: If the White Sox fail to draw 1.5 million annual fans at New Comiskey Park in the 11th through 20th years of their lease, the state of Illinois is contractually obliged to cover the shortfall at the gate by buying upto 300,000 tickets. 

         You'd expect that the public would get something, perhaps affordable seats, in return for subsidizing stadiums. Instead, the cheap seats in the new parks are scarcer. The Seattle Mariners' proposed park, for instance, will contain about one-fourth as many general-admission seats as the present location. This erosion of low-cost seats is a long-running trend. 

         So too is the dramatic increase in luxury seating, which is the primary real reason for the ballpark-building boom. The real gold mines are the posh luxury suites that lease for between $30,000 and $200,000 a year (payable in advance). A comparable moneymaker is the club deck, just above the first-tier seating. These pricey sections are occupied usually on a season-ticket basis, and offer the best sightlines, roomier seats, and wait staff who peddle gourmet fare. 

         The gilding doesn't end there: New parks also include members-only stadium clubs and on-premises bars and restaurants. 

          Naturally, owners don't advertise their new parks as a means of making life better for elite ticketholders. They say that only a new stadium will allow them to make enough money to stay in town or to field a competitive team and to allow fans to savor that old-time baseball flavor in greater comfort and convenience. Local taxpayers tend to lay off this pitch--they have voted these measures down in Illinois, Washington state, California, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Politically savvy owners usually bypass the voters and tap state governments directly for the money. 

         Larger and more lavish stadiums translate into greater land and construction costs. Operable roofs, such as those in Toronto's SkyDome, Phoenix's BankOne Ballpark, and those proposed for Seattle and Milwaukee, are budget-busters. Since most teams put up little (if any) of their own money, they have scant incentive to economize on the parks. In Seattle, Mariner management has demanded an operable roof even though the city has the driest weather in MLB outside California. The real problem with the Seattle climate is cold weather in spring and fall, but the unsealed roof won't make the park warmer or totally free of wind. 

         Lately, the cost of stadiums has ranged from about $300 million to $500 million. The multipurpose stadium that the Yankees want built on Manhattan's lower west side tentatively carries a $1 billion price tag. Add the financing and maintenance costs, and even a midpriced project goes through the retractable roof. At one point, the cost of the Brewers' proposed stadium grew from $250 million to $845 million, and that's not counting the value of the land. 

         The good news is that not every owner is demanding a castle for his team. All Pittsburgh Pirates owner Kevin McClatchy wants is a ""35,000-to-37,000-seat park with natural grass and no roof, bells, or whistles."" Though his attitude is commendable, the proposed park will still cost about $200 million, and perhaps an equal amount in interest. 

         Why should the public chip in? Taxpayer subsidies don't produce cheaper tickets--they produce more expensive tickets. The average admission price (not counting club seats and suites) rises about 35 percent when a team moves into new digs. And independent economists (i.e., those not hired by stadium proponents) discount the claim that new stadiums spur regional economic growth. 

         But one compelling argument for subsidies is that new stadiums can pull their cities together when properly designed and sited. This requires a downtown or neighborhood location where lots of fans can take the bus or the train to the game; where they can walk to the stadium from work, hotels, restaurants, or bars; and where getting to the game is a communal event that is part of a broader urban experience. This is the case with older parks such as Wrigley Field and Fenway Park, and the new ones in Toronto, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Denver. 

         ""If you put them in the wrong place, it's a colossal waste of money,"" says the planning director of the city of Cleveland. ""But if you put them in the right place, the benefits are phenomenal,"" 

         Recent attendance patterns show that urban parks generate much better patronage than suburban ones or those in neither/nor locations. There are also strong indicators that suggest new urban parks have ""legs,"" retaining more of their patrons after the novelty wears off. But some teams deliberately seek isolated locations, where they can better monopolize parking revenues and game-related food, drink, and souvenir business. This is why the White Sox moated their park with 100 acres of parking, why the Milwaukee Brewers refuse to build downtown, and why the Mariners insisted on the most remote of Seattle's three ballpark-siting options. 

         Modern conveniences aside, the new baseball shrines are a mixed bag. Most are visually impressive, boast interestingly shaped playing fields, and start off as box-office hits. But too many of them are large and expensive, tend to live on the dole, and are hampered by seat layouts that create a caste system among fans. At their best, they strengthen their cities; at their worst, they exploit them. 

         The decision-making process behind the financing and building of new ballparks has become predictable, as have the designs. But the good news is that our stadium boom is far from over. If owners and public agencies can be persuaded to take a longer view of stadium economics and community concerns, we may yet see parks that better unite traditional character with modern convenience.

         Fourscore and seven years ago, the first steel and concrete baseball palace opened for business. Philadelphia's Shibe Park, home to the Athletics and later the Phillies, was one of 13 urban ballparks built in the seven-year period now regarded as the golden age of ballpark architecture.

20,"My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: ""I saw that your father had died,"" she wrote. ""He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?"" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. 

         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. 

         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. 

         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. 

         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. 

         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. 

         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. 

         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. 

         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. 

         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. 

         ""Loyalty."" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. 

         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. 

         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. 

         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of BolÃ­var and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. 

         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. 

         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. 

         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. 

         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) 

         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. 

         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. 

         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. 

         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. 

         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as ""Suvorov,"" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. 

         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called ""Route 29"") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled ""Only You"") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. 

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, ""Let's do it together. It'll take half as long."" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. 

         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. 

         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. 

         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. 

         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, ""Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax."" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.

20,"My Father's Estate 

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: ""I saw that your father had died,"" she wrote. ""He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?"" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. 

         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. 

         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. 

         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. 

         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. 

         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. 

         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. 

         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. 

         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. 

         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. 

         ""Loyalty."" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. 

         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. 

         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. 

         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of BolÃ­var and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. 

         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. 

         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely.

He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. 

         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. 

         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) 

         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. 

         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. 

         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. 

         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. 

         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as ""Suvorov,"" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. 

         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called ""Route 29"") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled ""Only You"") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. 

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, ""Let's do it together. It'll take half as long."" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. 

         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. 

         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. 

         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. 

         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, ""Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax."" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.

         A letter from an ill-mannered former high-school classmate of long ago, one of several like it, which I pass on in paraphrase: ""I saw that your father had died,"" she wrote. ""He was always so clever about money. Did he leave you a big estate? Did he figure out a way around the estate tax?"" It's a rude question, but it has an answer. 

         My sister and I have been going through my father's estate lately with his lawyer, and we're pawing through old, dusty files to find bank account numbers and rules for annuities, so maybe it's a good time to think about what my father, Herbert Stein, left to us. 

         He did indeed leave some money. By the standards we read about in the Wall Street Journal or Sports Illustrated , it was not worthy of much ink. In any event, because of the class-warfare-based death tax, the amount that will be left is vastly less than what he had saved. As an economist, my father was famous for defending taxes as a necessary evil. But even he was staggered, not long before his death, when he considered the taxes on his savings that would go to the Internal Revenue Service. 

         The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent, after an initial exemption and then a transition amount taxed at around 40 percent (and all that after paying estate expenses). When I think about it, I want to cry. My father and mother lived frugally all their lives. They never had a luxury car. They never flew first-class unless it was on the expense account. They never in their whole lives went on an expensive vacation. When he last went into the hospital, my father was still wearing an old pair of gray wool slacks with a sewed-up hole in them from where my dog ripped them--15 years ago. 

         They never had live-in help. My father washed the dishes after my mother made the meatloaf. My father took the bus whenever he could. His only large expenditure in his and my mom's whole lives was to pay for schools for his children and grandchildren. He never bought bottled, imported water; he said whatever came out of the tap was good enough for him. They still used bargain-basement furniture from before the war for their bedroom furniture and their couch. I never once knew them to order the most expensive thing in a restaurant, and they always took the leftovers home. 

         They made not one penny of it from stock options or golden parachutes. They made it all by depriving themselves in the name of thrift and prudence and preparing for the needs of posterity. To think that this abstemiousness and this display of virtue will primarily benefit the IRS is really just so galling I can hardly stand it. The only possible reason for it is to satisfy some urge of jealousy by people who were less self-disciplined. 

         There are a few material, tangible items that an assessor will have to come in to appraise. There are my father's books, from his days at Williams College and the University of Chicago, many of them still neatly underlined and annotated in his handwriting, which did not change from 1931 until days before his death. Most of them are about economics, but some are poetry. 

         That's another item my father left: his own poetry and his massive prose writings. Very little of it is about anything at all abstruse. There are no formulas and no graphs or charts, except from his very last years. There are many essays about how much he missed my mom when she died, about how much he loved the sights of Washington, about how dismaying it was that there was still so much confusion about basic issues in economics. And there are his satires of haiku about public policy, his takeoffs on Wordsworth and Shakespeare, often composed for a friend's birthday, then sometimes later published. I suppose there will not be much tax on these because my father was hardly a writer for the large audience. 

         Some of them will go to the Nixon Library, and some will be on bookshelves in the (very small and modest) house my wife and I own in Malibu, a place he found beguiling because he had always wanted to live by the ocean and write. And there are his furniture and his clothes, none of which has any value at all except to me because they remind me of him and because, when I stand near them in his closet, I can still smell his smell of hair and skin and leather shoes, the closet smelling a lot like he smelled when he came home from work in 1954 carrying a newspaper that said there could be no more racial segregation in schools. And there are his mementos of Richard Nixon, his White House cufflinks, photos of Camp David, certificates and honorary degrees, and clippings of great events of state. And there are his love letters to and from my mother when they were courting in 1935 and 1936, still tied with light blue ribbon in what was my mother's lingerie drawer, talking about their love triumphing over the dangers of the Depression. I suppose we'll have to place a value on these and have them taxed, too. 

         But these are the trivia of what he left me and my sister. The really valuable estate cannot be touched by the death tax. The man's legacy to his family has almost nothing to do with anything that can be appraised in dollars and cents. 

         The example of loyalty and principle: When he had just taken over as the chairman of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisers, he hired a young staff economist named Ron Hoffman (brother of Dustin Hoffman). Almost immediately, John Dean, then White House counsel, came to see my father to tell him that he had to fire Hoffman. Apparently, Ron Hoffman had signed a public anti-war letter. The FBI, or whoever, said that showed he was not loyal and not qualified. My father said that this was a free country, that Ron Hoffman was hired as an economist not as a political flack for RN, and that he would not be fired because he disagreed with some aspect of Nixon policy. After much worrying, Hoffman was allowed to stay--and performed well. 

         My father was loyal, and the IRS cannot impound that legacy. When RN ran into every kind of problem after June of 1972, most of which were unearned and a chunk of which was earned, my father never thought of disavowing him or even distancing himself from Nixon. Even though he had an appointment to the University of Virginia in his pocket, Pop several times extended his stay at the White House to help out with the struggles over inflation and recession, and never once publicly said a word against Nixon. 

         Long after, when Nixon was blasted as an anti-Semite, my father told in print and in person of the Nixon he knew: kind; concerned about all on his staff, regardless of ethnicity; pro-Israel; pro-Jewish in every important cause. My father would never turn his back on a man who had been as conscientious to the cause of peace and as kind to the Stein family as RN had been. 

         ""Loyalty."" There is no item for it in the inventory of estate assets to be taxed. 

         My father lived his life, especially in the latter years of it, in a haze of appreciation. Whatever small faults he could and did find with America, he endlessly reminded anyone who listened that the best achievement of mankind was America, whose current failings were trivial by historic standards, which was in a constant process of amelioration, and which offered its citizens the best chance in history for a good life. 

         When he did consider the failures of American life in the past, especially institutionalized racism, he did so to note the astonishing progress that had been made in his lifetime. He had no use for those who held up a mirror of fault-finding from the left or the right when he could see in his own era what vast improvements in freedom had been made for blacks, Jews, women, Asians, Hispanics, and every other minority. 

         He appreciated art, especially ballet and opera. He sat for hours in front of the television watching videos of Romeo and Juliet or Les Sylphides or Tosca . He lived to go to the Kennedy Center to see great ballet or opera, and he talked of it endlessly. But he also appreciated art in the form of obscure fountains in front of federal buildings, of the statues of BolÃ­var and George Washington and San Martin. He appreciated the intricate moldings on the ceiling of the second floor of the Cosmos Club. He was in awe of the beauty of the mighty Potomac in fall and of the rolling green hunt country around Middleburg and The Plains, Va., in summer. 

         This quality of gratitude for America and for the beauty of life cannot be taxed, at least not so far. 

         He appreciated his friends and did not differentiate between them on the basis of fame or position. He took the words of his longtime pal Murray Foss at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tank where he hung his hat for many years, into account; and the words of Mrs. Wiggins, who ran the cafeteria at the AEI; and the thoughts of Alan Greenspan or the head of Goldman, Sachs; and valued them entirely on their merits to him, not on the basis of how much press or money the speaker had. He never once in my lifetime's recall said that any man or woman deserved special respect for riches--in fact, like Adam Smith, he believed that the pleadings of the rich merited special suspicion. He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most.

He did not believe that my sister or I should devote our lives to the pursuit of money, and by his life set an example to us of pursuing only what was interesting and challenging, not what paid the most. I never knew him to chase a deal or a job (he never in his whole life applied for a job!) for any other reason except that it was of interest to him. He derived more pleasure from speaking to his pals at the book club of the Cosmos Club about John Keats than he did from giving speeches to trade associations that paid him handsomely. 

         My father's stance against seeking money for its own sake--so wildly unsuited to today's age, but so reassuring to his children--cannot be taken by the Treasury. 

         Pop had a way of putting what I thought of as catastrophes into their rightful context. If I was hysterical about losing some scriptwriting job, my father would brush it aside as a basic risk, part of the life I had chosen. If my stocks went down, even dramatically, my father would explain that if I had a roof over my head and enough to eat, I was far, far ahead of the game. Most reassuring, my father would tell me that my family and I could always come to Washington, D.C., and live quietly, keeping him company, for which not a lot of money was required. (My father lived on a fraction of the income from his savings, even allowing for paying for his grandchildren's education.) 

         Once, about 25 years ago, when my boss treated me unfairly, my father said that if it happened again, I should quit and he would take care of me until I found a job. I never needed to do it, but the offer hung in my mind as a last refuge forever. 

         This reassurance--that somehow things will be all right, that there is a lot of ruin in a man, as well as in a nation, to paraphrase his idol, Adam Smith--has become part of me, and I can still summon it up when I am terrified because of a huge quarterly tax payment due or a bad day on the market. Again, the IRS taxes it at zero. 

         My father himself, as far as I know, inherited no money at all from his father. He did inherit a belief that hard work would solve most problems, that spending beyond one's means was a recipe for disaster, that flashy showoff behavior with borrowed money was understandable but foolish. He did inherit enough common sense to tell his son that buying property he would never live in was probably a bad mistake. (He rarely spoke in moral absolutes. He believed instead that humans could and would make individual choices but that there were surely consequences to those choices that could be considered.) He passed these beliefs on to me, although they have become somewhat attenuated by my 20-plus years in the fleshpots of Hollywood. Still, I am one of the only men I know here who has never been drastically short of money (so far), and that I attribute to hearing his rules of prudence. 

         Most of all, my father believed in loving and appreciating those persons close to him. He stayed close to all his pals from the Nixon days (and would not hear personal criticism of Pat Buchanan, who had been a friend and colleague, although he was bewildered by Pat's stands on many issues). He basked in the pleasure of the company of his colleagues and friends at the American Enterprise Institute, which he thought of as one of his three homes--the Cosmos Club and his extremely modest but well-situated apartment at the Watergate were the others. 

         He could form attachments readily. Even in his last days in the hospital, he took a liking to a Ukrainian-born doctor and used to refer to him as ""Suvorov,"" after the Russian general written of glowingly in War and Peace-- which still sits on the table next to his reading chair, with his notes on little pieces of paper in it. 

         He grieved like a banshee when my mother died in 1997 and never really got over the loss of a soul mate of 61 years, who literally dreamed the same dreams he did. Once, he wrote my mother a poem (which he called ""Route 29"") about the beauty of Route 29 north of Charlottesville, Va., and the pleasure of riding along it with my mom. He filed it away for further work and never touched it again. The day after my mother's death, he found it--with her reply poem telling of how she hoped to never see those hills and those clouds and those cattle with anyone else but Pop. She had written her poem (which she titled ""Only You"") and put it back in the file without ever telling him. He survived that terrible loss with the help of a beautiful widow, whom he also came to appreciate and live for. He probably spent more time trying to help her with an annuity problem than he ever did on any financial feature of his own life. A simple call from her inviting him to dinner in her kitchen on Kalorama Circle was enough to make his life complete. 

         Even in his hospital bed, hearing my son's voice on the phone could make him smile through the fear and the pain. (""He sounds so sweet when he calls me 'Grandpa,' "" my father said, beaming even with tubes in him.) 

         Never once did my sister or I ever ask him for help that he hesitated, let alone declined, to give. Usually this was some research we were too lazy to do, but which he did without any resistance at all. When I was a child and had a chore like leaf raking that I didn't want to do, his simple answer was to say, ""Let's do it together. It'll take half as long."" I use that with my son almost every day, along with the devotion, and my father's example about his friends from long ago to make my life work. He stayed close with friends from Williams College Class of '35, especially Richard Helms of the CIA. He had lunch with one of his pals from Williams, Johnny Davis, class of '33, who got him a job as a dishwasher at Sigma Chi, days before he went into the hospital. 

         This quality of devotion and the rewards I get from it are worth far more than any stocks or bonds in my father's estate--and cannot be taken away at the marginal rate of 55 percent. Plus, I can pass it on to my son without any generation-skipping surcharge. 

         And he left something else of perhaps even greater value: a good name. Many people quarreled with my father's ideas about taxes or about when to balance the budget. He faced frequent opposition to his belief in a large defense budget. Of course, most of the people he knew disagreed with him about RN. But no one ever questioned that he came by his views honestly, by means of research and analysis and sometimes sentiment, but not for any venal reason or by the process of money changing hands. His reputation for honesty was simply without a speck of question upon it. 

         This good name cannot be taxed at all, at least not right now. My sister and I and our children will have it for as long as we keep it clean. It's priceless, incalculable in value. 

         So, in answer to the query from the forward high-school classmate, ""Yes, my father did leave an immense estate, and yes, he did manage to beat the estate tax."" The only problem is that I miss him every single minute, and I already had the best parts of the estate without his being gone, so the death part is pure loss.

         The game of biographical ""gotcha"" is a perennially popular form of ideological blood sport. The goal is to find an incriminating datum that will leave a permanent stain on the target's reputation, make his defenders look like craven apologists, and give the general public a ready-made judgment that can be wielded without too much reading or thought. If the anti-communism of George Orwell or Arthur Koestler bugs you, you can point to recent allegations that the former was a snitch and the latter a rapist. If you resent the fact that your college professors forced you to read I, Rigoberta MenchÃº , you can rejoice in the discovery that she embellished some important details of her life story. Didn't Karl Marx beat his wife? And what about Freud's thing for his sister-in-law and his taste for cocaine? 

         To this list now add Columbia literature professor Edward W. Said, the subject of a fiercely debated article in the September issue of Commentary . The article, by American-born Israeli legal scholar Justus Reid Weiner, contends that Said, who was born in Jerusalem to a Christian Arab family in 1935, has over the years deliberately obscured some facts about his early life, and amplified others, in order to create the impression that he was, of all things, Palestinian. 

         Not so fast, says Weiner: Said's childhood was not ""the parable of Palestinian identity"" marked by dispossession from a beloved homeland and the subsequent pain of exile. Instead, Said ""grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members."" 

         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to ""spin"" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) 

         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. 

         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls ""the Palestinian Versailles."" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him ""The Professor of Terror."" New York magazine once called him ""Arafat's man in New York."" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special ""Money"" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be ""on the payroll of the PLO."" 

         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's ""Algiers Declaration"" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a ""two-state solution"" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. 

         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, ""bi-national"" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with ""the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence."" 

         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. 

         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for ""post-colonial"" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to ""the other""--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) ""must be represented"" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. 

         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses ""a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure."" 

         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. ""He is easily distracted"" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , ""answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol."" 

         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. 

         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing ""criticism over solidarity,"" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .

Instead, Said ""grew up not in Jerusalem but in Cairo, where his father, an American citizen, had moved as an economic expatriate approximately nine years before Edward's birth and had become the owner of a thriving business; and there, until his own departure for the United States as a teenager in 1951, the young Edward Said resided in luxurious apartments, attended private English schools, and played tennis at the exclusive Gezira Sporting Club as the child of one of its few Arab members."" 

         A similar account of Edward Said's youth can be found in a new book called Out of Place , the author of which is Edward Said. The book, Said's 17 th , is a wrenching, intimate account of growing up in Cairo's wealthy Levantine expatriate community, of summering in the dreary Lebanese resort town of Dhour el Shweir, and of visiting the family home in Jerusalem, sometimes for as long as several months. Weiner claims that the memoir is an elaborate sleight of hand and speculates that Said decided to ""spin"" the story of his past--by telling the truth about it--when he heard about Weiner's inquiries. In the weeks since his essay appeared, Weiner's motives, methods, and assertions have been roundly attacked by Said and his friends, and Weiner has made some attempt at clarification. (Click for a recap of the controversy and links to relevant articles, or click here for my review of Out of Place .) 

         Just who is Edward Said that his family's real estate holdings and his grammar school records rate 7,000 words in Commentary , not to mention three years of research by a scholar in residence at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs? Followers of Middle East politics, as well as viewers of the NewsHour With Jim Lehrer , where Said often appears, know him as an eloquent spokesman for the Palestinian cause. Readers of The Nation know him as a formidable reviewer of opera and classical music. Several generations of graduate students in a number of disciplines know him as the author of Orientalism . The 30,000 literary scholars who make up the membership of the Modern Language Association--minus one who resigned in protest earlier this year over Said's election--know him as Mr. President. Readers of Al-Hayat , a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, and Al-Ahram , a Cairo weekly, know him as a regular commentator on politics and culture. Each of these identities--political activist, literary scholar, university professor, public intellectual--are, in Said's case, inordinately complex in and of themselves. The tensions between them--between intellectual, aesthetic, and political impulses that are felt with enormous passion and expressed with great vehemence--make Said an uncommonly interesting, and endlessly controversial, intellectual figure. 

         Most controversial--and most misunderstood--has been Said's involvement in Palestinian affairs. He has published half a dozen books on the plight of the Palestinians, including The Question of Palestine (1979), After the Last Sky (1986), and Peace and Its Discontents (1995), a scathing critique of the Oslo peace accords, which Said calls ""the Palestinian Versailles."" These writings, his relationship with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, and his many years of service in the Palestine National Council (the now-defunct Palestinian parliament in exile, from which he resigned in 1991 after being diagnosed with leukemia) have invited smears and misrepresentations: A decade ago Commentary branded him ""The Professor of Terror."" New York magazine once called him ""Arafat's man in New York."" And he showed up last spring, unnamed, in The                 New Yorker 's special ""Money"" issue as a well-dressed Columbia don rumored to be ""on the payroll of the PLO."" 

         Until very recently, Said has been an insistent voice for Palestinian statehood: He helped to draft the PLO's ""Algiers Declaration"" of 1988, which linked this aspiration to the recognition of Israel's right to exist. Over the years, he has often said that his own place in such a state would be as its toughest critic. Even as he has been unsparing in his indictments of Israeli and American policy, he has not let Arab governments--or the Palestinian leadership--off the hook. He has assailed the corrupt, authoritarian regimes that rule most of the Arab world, punctured the ideological phantasms of Pan-Arabist nationalism and reactionary Islam alike, and bemoaned the impoverished state of Arab cultural and intellectual life. He has also, within the Palestinian camp, been a consistent advocate of reconciliation with Israel and an opponent of terrorism. The Question of Palestine called for a ""two-state solution"" at a time when the official PLO ambition was total control over British Mandatory Palestine. The book, published in Israel in 1981, had, as of the mid-'90s, never been translated into Arabic or published in any Arab country. 

         In 1978, in the wake of the Camp David accords, Said delivered a message from Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to one of Arafat's top aides indicating that the United States would recognize the PLO as a legitimate party to peace talks in exchange for recognition of Israel. Arafat ignored the message. Fifteen years later, when Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands on the White House lawn, Said, who had been invited to the event by its patron, Bill Clinton, stayed home. Since then, as bien-pensant American opinion has embraced the ""peace process,"" Said has bemoaned Arafat's ""capitulation"" and grown increasingly disgusted with the chairman's dictatorial rule over a few scraps of occupied territory and with Israel's continued expropriation of Palestinian lands. In the New York Times Magazine last spring, he wrote that the Palestinian state toward which the peace process seemed, however pokily, to be tending could not provide democracy and justice for the Palestinians. Instead, he called for a single, ""bi-national"" state based on a constitution (something neither Israel nor the areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority currently has), with ""the idea and practice of citizenship, not of ethnic or racial community, as the main vehicle for coexistence."" 

         But to treat Said solely, or even primarily, as a political figure is necessarily to produce a distorted view of his life. He is, first and foremost, a literary critic, who wrote his Ph.D. at Harvard--on Joseph Conrad, a lifelong obsession--under Harry Levin, one of the champions of a comparative approach to literary study. Said's subsequent work has retained much of the expansive spirit and rigorous methodology of Levin's teachings. Beginnings: Intention and Method , the book which made Said's academic reputation, is a bulky study of how novels begin, carried out through painstakingly close formal analysis and displaying crushing erudition. 

         But Said's fame outside the American academy rests on Orientalism , his sweeping account of how Western art, literature, and scholarship have produced a deformed, biased picture of Arab and Muslim culture in the service of colonial domination. The impact of Orientalism far exceeded its subject, vast though that was. In addition to laying the groundwork for ""post-colonial"" studies as an area of inquiry, the book inspired a flurry of scholarship devoted to ""the other""--to groups of people who, by virtue of race, gender, sexuality, or geographical location, are unable to represent themselves and so (to echo the line from Karl Marx that serves as the book's epigraph) ""must be represented"" by those more powerful. And Orientalism , with its harsh critiques of European philology and American social science, contributed to an epistemological shift in the American academy: Traditional disciplines were no longer to be taken for granted as the vehicles of objective knowledge but themselves became the objects of ideological analysis. 

         Both Said's methods and his substantive claims have come under attack. Because his theoretical debt to Michel Foucault and his unabashedly political intentions marked him as an avatar of the emerging academic left, a lot of the criticism came from traditional scholars. In the New York Review of Books , for example, the Princeton historian Bernard Lewis, one of the chief modern villains of Orientalism , decried Said's inflammatory tone and questioned his knowledge of history, philology, and Arabic. (To read Lewis' piece, click here. For Said's angry response, click here.) But the most sustained assault on Orientalism 's premises, and on its prestige, came from the left. In a book called In Theory --a wholesale slaughter of the sacred cows of the postmodern Western intelligentsia--the Indian Marxist literary critic Aijaz Ahmad raised further questions about Said's mastery of his sources and accused him of self-aggrandizement and insufficient political discipline. Whereas Lewis attacks Said for trashing the norms and values of traditional scholarship, Ahmad rebukes him for hewing too closely to them. And while Lewis believes Said to be motivated by a crude anti-Western leftist animus, Ahmad finds him altogether too enamored of the canons of European literature and avers that Said possesses ""a very conservative mind, essentially Tory in its structure."" 

         Lewis and Ahmad are both right. Orientalism and its even more ambitious sequel Culture and Imperialism are works of passionate, almost agonized ambivalence. To read them is to encounter a mind at war with itself and the world (and ready to go to war with his critics, as any number of exchanges over the past quarter-century will show). Said's evident love of the literature and music of the West continually collides with his righteous anger at what the West has done to the rest. His desire to use literary criticism as a weapon on the side of the oppressed sits athwart the pleasure he takes in letting his mind play over the meaning in a novel or a poem. The results are books at once exhausting in their detail and maddening in their omissions, uneven in tone, overreaching and underargued. ""He is easily distracted"" the critic John Leonard remarked in an appreciative review of Culture and Imperialism , ""answering too many fire alarms, sometimes to pour on more petrol."" 

         O rientalism and Culture and Imperialism are unquestionably incendiary, but they are also permanent and exemplary works of late-20 th -century criticism, in no small part because they invite so much argument, because for all the intellectual authority they project they remain open, vulnerable, provisional. And they also fulfill the basic mandate of literary analysis, which is to illuminate the works they discuss: To return to Verdi's Aida , Conrad's Heart of Darkness , or Kipling's Kim after reading Said on them is to find them richer, stranger, and more complicated than you had ever imagined. 

         More than anyone else in his generation, Edward Said has sought to embody an unfashionable, perhaps obsolescent idea of the intellectual--immersed in culture and committed to politics, placing ""criticism over solidarity,"" speaking truth to power, and steering clear of gods that fail. There was a time when this idea flourished more widely--even in the pages of Commentary .

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested. 

         The detailed rankings and comments for all tasters on all beers may be found .

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters.

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this:

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers.

The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received.

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me.

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar?

The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         I love beer, but lately I've been wondering: Am I getting full value for my beer dollar? As I've stocked up on microbrews and fancy imports, I've told myself that their taste is deeper, richer, more complicated, more compelling--and therefore worth the 50 percent to 200 percent premium they command over cheap mass products or even mainstream Bud. And yet, I've started to wonder, is this just costly snobbery? If I didn't know what I was drinking, could I even tell whether it was something from Belgium, vs. something from Pabst? 

         I'm afraid we'll never know the answer to that exact question, since I'm not brave enough to expose my own taste to a real test. But I'm brave enough to expose my friends'. This summer, while working at Microsoft, I put out a call for volunteers for a ""science of beer"" experiment. Testing candidates had to meet two criteria: 1) they had to like beer; and 2) they had to think they knew the difference between mass products and high-end microbrews. 

         Twelve tasters were selected, mainly on the basis of essays detailing their background with beer. A few were selected because they had been bosses in the Microsoft department where I worked. All were software managers or developers ; all were male, but I repeat myself. Nearly half had grown up outside the United States or lived abroad for enough years to speak haughtily about American macrobrews. Most tasters came in talking big about the refinement of their palates. When they entered the laboratory (which mere moments before had been a Microsoft conference room), they discovered an experiment set up on the following lines: 

         1 Philosophy                : The experiment was designed to take place in two separate sessions. The first session, whose results are revealed here, involved beers exclusively from the lager group. Lagers are the light-colored, relatively lightly flavored brews that make up most of the vattage of beer consumption in the United States. Imported lagers include Foster's, Corona, and Heineken. Budweiser is a lager; so are Coors, Miller, most light beers, and most bargain-basement beers. 

         Beer snobs sneer at lagers, because they look so watery and because so many bad beers are in the group. But the lager test came first, for two reasons. One, lagers pose the only honest test of the ability to tell expensive from dirt-cheap beers. There are very few inexpensive nut brown ales, India pale ales, extra special bitters, or other fancy-pantsy, microbrew-style, nonlager drinks. So if you want to see whether people can taste a money difference among beers of the same type, you've got to go lager. Two, the ideal of public service requires lager coverage. This is what most people drink, so new findings about lager quality could do the greatest good for the greatest number. 

         In the second stage of the experiment, held several weeks later, the same testers reassembled to try the fancier beers. The results of that tasting will be reported separately, once Microsoft's mighty Windows 2000-powered central computers have . 

         2 Materials                : Ten lagers were selected for testing, representing three distinct price-and-quality groups. Through the magic of the market, it turns out that lager prices nearly all fall into one of three ranges: 

         a) High end at $1.50 to $1.60 per pint. (""Per pint"" was the unit-pricing measure at the Safeway in Bellevue, Wash., that was the standard supply source for the experiment. There are 4.5 pints per six pack, so the high-end price point is around $7 per six pack.) 

         b) Middle at around 80 cents per pint, or under $4 per six pack. 

         c) Low at 50 cents to 55 cents per pint, or under $3 per six pack. 

         The neat 6:3:2 mathematical relationship among the price groups should be noted. The high-end beers cost roughly three times as much as the cheapest ones, and twice as much as the middle range. The beers used in the experiment were as follows: 

                         High End              

                         Grolsch. Import lager (Holland). $1.67 per pint. (See an important .) Chosen for the test because of its beer-snob chic; also, one of my favorite beers. 

                         Heineken. Import lager (Holland). $1.53 per pint. (Sale price. List price was $1.71 per pint.) Chosen because it is America's long-standing most popular import. 

                         Pete's Wicked Lager. National-scale ""microbrew."" $1.11 per pint. (Deep-discount sale. List price $1.46 per pint.) Like the next one, this put us into the gray zone for a lager test. Few American ""microbreweries"" produce lagers of any sort. Pete's is called a lager but was visibly darker than, say, Bud. 

                         Samuel Adams Boston Lager. National macro-microbrew. $1.56 per pint. (That was list price. The following week it was on sale for $1.25 per pint, which would have made it do far better in the value rankings.) Calls itself America's Best Beer. Has dark orangey-amber color that was obviously different from all other lagers tested. 

                         Mid-Range              

                         Budweiser. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) Self-styled King of Beers. 

                         Miller Genuine Draft. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint.) 

                         Coors Light. $.84 per pint. (Sale. List price $.89 per pint. Isn't price competition a wonderful thing?) The Silver Bullet That Won't Slow You Down. 

                         Cheap              

                         Milwaukee's Best. $.55 per pint. (Sale. List price $.62 per pint.) A k a ""Beast."" 

                         Schmidt's. $.54 per pint. (Sale. List $.62 per pint.) Box decorated with a nice painting of a trout. 

                         Busch. $.50 per pint. (Sale. List $.69 per pint.) Painting of mountains. 

         The Safeway that supplied the beers didn't carry any true bargain-basement products, such as ""Red, White, and Blue,"" ""Old German,"" or the one with generic printing that just says ""Beer."" The experiment was incomplete in that regard, but no tester complained about a shortage of bad beer. Also, with heavy heart, the test administrator decided to leave malt liquors, such as Mickey's (with its trademark wide-mouth bottles), off the list. They have the air of cheapness but actually cost more than Bud, probably because they offer more alcohol per pint. 

         3 Experimental                 procedure: Each taster sat down before an array of 10 plastic cups labeled A through J. The A-to-J coding scheme was the same for all tasters. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the sample beers. (Total intake, for a taster who drank all of every sample: 30 ounces, or two and a half normal beers. Not lethal; also, they were just going back to software coding when they were done.) Saltines were available to cleanse the palate. The cups were red opaque plastic, so tasters could judge the beer's color only from above. There was no time limit for the tasting, apart from the two-hour limit in which we had reserved the conference room. One experimenter (the boss of most of the others there) rushed through his rankings in 10 minutes and gave the lowest overall scores. The taster who took the longest, nearly the full two hours, had the ratings that came closest to the relative price of the beers. (This man grew up in Russia.) The experimenters were asked not to compare impressions until the test was over. 

         After tasting the beers, each taster rated beers A through J on the following standards: 

                         Overall quality points: Zero to 100, zero as undrinkable and 100 as dream beer. Purely subjective measure of how well each taster liked each beer. 

                         Price category: The tasters knew that each beer came from the expensive, medium, or cheap category--and they had to guess where A through J belonged. A rating of 3 was most expensive, 2 for average, 1 for cheap. 

                         Description: ""Amusing presumption,"" ""fresh on the palate,"" ""crap,"" etc. 

                         Best and Worst: Tasters chose one Best and one Worst from the ""flight"" (as they would call it if this were a wine test). 

         When the session was over, results for each beer were collected in a grid like this: 

           

         To see all the grids for all the beers, click . 

         4 Data                 Analysis: The ratings led to four ways to assess the quality of the beers. 

                         1. Best and Worst. Least scientific, yet clearest cut in its results. Eleven tasters named a favorite beer. Ten of them chose Sam Adams . The other one chose Busch , the cheapest of all beers in the sample. (The taster who made this choice advises Microsoft on what new features should go into the next version of Word.) Busch was the only beer to receive both a Best and a Worst vote. 

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         Bottom rankings were also clear. Of the 11 naming a Worst beer, five chose Grolsch , the most expensive beer in the survey. Results by best/worst preference: 

           

                         2. Overall                 preference points                . This was a subtler and more illuminating look at similar trends. The beers were ranked on ""corrected average preference points""--an average of the zero-to-100 points assigned by each taster, corrected, just like ice skating scores, by throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. The tasters used widely varying scales--one confining all beers to the range between zero and 30, another giving 67 as his lowest mark. But the power of our corrected ranking system surmounted such difficulties to provide these results: 

           

         Here again one costly beer-- Sam Adams --shows up well, while another, Grolsch , continues to struggle, but not as badly as the medium-price Miller Genuine Draft . Sam's success could reflect its quasi-mislabeling, presenting a strong-flavored beer as a ""lager."" It could also reflect that participants simply thought it was good. (Only one guessed it was Sam Adams.) As for Grolsch ... it is very strongly hopped, which can seem exotic if you know you're drinking a pricey import but simply bad if you don't. MGD overtook Grolsch in the race for the bottom because, while many people hated Grolsch, some actually liked it; no one liked MGD. There are some other important findings buried in the chart, but they're clearest if we move to ... 

         3) Value for Money: the Taste-o-meter® . Since this experiment's real purpose was to find the connection between cost and taste, the next step was to adjust subjective preference points by objective cost. The Taste-o-meter rating for each beer was calculated by dividing its corrected average preference rating by its price per pint . If Beer X had ratings twice as high as Beer Y, but it cost three times as much, Beer Y would have the higher Taste-o-meter rating. When the 10 beers are reranked this way, the results are: 

           

         In a familiar pattern, we have Grolsch bringing up the rear, with less than one-quarter the Taste-o-meter power of Busch , the No. 1 value beer. The real news in this ranking is: the success of Busch ; the embarrassment of Heineken and Miller Genuine Draft , an expensive and a medium beer, respectively, which share the cellar with the hapless Grolsch ; and the nearly Busch-like value of Milwaukee's Best and Schmidt's . It is safe to say that none of our testers would have confessed respect for Busch, Milwaukee's Best, or Schmidt's before the contest began. But when they didn't know what they were drinking, they found these beers much closer in quality to ""best"" beers than the prices would indicate. 

                         4) Social Value for Money: the Snob-o-meter® . In addition to saying which beers they preferred, the tasters were asked to estimate whether the beers were expensive or not--in effect, to judge whether other people would like and be impressed by the beers. One taster perfectly understood the intention of this measure when he said, in comments about Beer B (Heineken), ""I don't like it, but I bet it's what the snobs buy."" The Snob-o-meter rating for each beer is similar to the Taste-o-meter. You start with the ""group"" ranking--whether the tasters thought the beer belonged in Group 1 (cheap), 2, or 3--and then divide by the price per pint. The result tells you the social-mobility power of the beer--how impressive it will seem, relative to how much it costs. The Snob-o-meter rankings are: 

           

         We won't even speak of poor Grolsch or MGD any more. The story here is the amazing snob-power-per-dollar of Busch , closely followed by Schmidt's . A dollar spent on Busch gets you three times the impressiveness of a dollar spent in Grolsch, useful information when planning a party. Not everyone liked Busch--one called it ""crap""; another, ""Water. LITE."" But the magic of statistics lets us see the larger trends. 

          5 Conclusions                . Further study is needed. But on the basis of evidence to date, we can say: 

          

            One and only one beer truly survived the blind taste test. This is Sam Adams , which 10 tasters independently ranked ""best"" without knowing they were drinking a fancy beer. (They knew it was darker than the others but couldn't have known whether this was some trick off-brand sneaked into the test.) 

            Don't serve Grolsch unless you know people will consider it exotic, or unless you've invited me. 

            Apart from Sam Adams and Grolsch, the tasters really had trouble telling one beer from another . This conclusion is implicit in many of the findings, but it was really obvious during the experiment itself, when the confident look of men-who-know-their-beer quickly turned to dismay and panic as they realized that all the lagers tasted pretty much the same. 

          

         The evidence suggests other implications about specific beers. For instance, the comments about Coors Light are much less enthusiastic than the average-or-better numerical rankings. Most tasters paused to complain about it--""fizzy and soapy""--before giving it reasonable marks. But the main implication, and the most useful consumer news from this study, is a radically simplified buying philosophy for lager beers. Based on this study, rational consumers should: 

         1) Buy Sam Adams when they want an individual glass of lager to be as good as it can be. 

         2) Buy Busch at all other times, since it gives them the maximum taste and social influence per dollar invested.

         ""This is not another book about civility,"" Deborah Tannen promises in the first sentence of The Argument Culture . ""Civility,"" she explains, suggests a ""veneer of politeness spread thin over human relations like a layer of marmalade over toast."" Instead, Tannen has written something less: a book about other books about civility. Quoting from Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, political scientist Larry Sabato, and others who have studied the rise of belligerence in politics, journalism, and law, Tannen spreads their insights thin over all human relations, painting a general theory of discord. The whole is less perceptive than its parts and more pernicious. 

         In her previous books-- That's Not What I Meant! (1986), You Just Don't Understand (1990), and Talking From 9 to 5 (1994)--Tannen carved out a niche as the nation's pre-eminent intergender translator and couples counselor. A professor of linguistics at Georgetown University, she transformed the comparative study of male and female conversational patterns from a linguistic subdiscipline into a self-help movement. Until recently, though, Tannen confined her analysis to conversations among dysfunctional individuals. (For an illustration, click .) But in The Argument Culture , she takes her movement one step further, peddling the elixir of mutual understanding as a remedy for the whole damned dysfunctional country. This is necessary, she argues, because ""contentious public discourse"" not only poisons the political atmosphere, it also risks infecting our most intimate relationships. 

         Tannen, like some grandmotherly creature from an Aesop fable, admonishes us to recognize what is good in the work of others, and it is only fair to extend her the same courtesy. Here's what's worth gleaning from her book: 

         Don't just quarrel; listen and learn. 

         Don't nit-pick other people's ideas; build your own. 

         Don't argue for the sake of arguing. 

         Truth and courage often lie in the middle, not the extremes. 

         Many issues are multisided. 

         Focus on the substance of debates, not on strategy, theater, or the opponents' personal flaws. 

         Don't fight over small issues. 

         Don't obstruct good ideas just so you can win. 

         If you portray everything as a scandal, no one will care when something really is scandalous. 

          All this is sage advice--for couples, for families, for bosses and employees, maybe even for book reviewers. But when she applies her precepts to our great national conversation, Tannen gets confused. She conflates belligerence, divisiveness, polarization, titillation, jealousy, incivility, aloofness, ruthlessness, cruelty, savagery, contempt, glibness, cynicism, anomie, partisanship, obstructionism, and gridlock. She makes culprits out of answering machines, electronic mail, campaign money, malpractice litigation, HMOs, corporate takeovers, and the demise of house calls by the family doctor. 

         ""When there is a need to make others wrong,"" Tannen argues, ""the temptation is great to oversimplify"" and to ""seize upon the weakest examples, ignore facts that support your opponent's views, and focus only on those that support yours."" In her need to make the ""argument culture"" wrong, she succumbs to these temptations. She blames the mainstream press, not just the paparazzi , for torturing Princess Diana and driving Adm. Mike Boorda to suicide. She compares to the propaganda of ""totalitarian countries"" (because falsehoods are spread) and to the dehumanization involved in ""ethnically motivated assaults"" (because reporters hound politicians). She blames communications technology for obscene and threatening phone calls made by former university President Richard Berendzen and former Judge Sol Wachtler. 

         Tannen's main mistake is failing to appreciate the difference between two distinct social spheres: the sphere of snuggle and the sphere of struggle. Some people--say, your spouse or your kids--you should snuggle with. Others--say, Saddam Hussein--you shouldn't. Tannen's antagonism toward antagonism makes sense in the former case but not in the latter. Among her illustrations of belligerence are William Safire's ""kick 'em when they're up"" philosophy of journalism and the media's use of war metaphors to describe Alan Greenspan's policies against inflation. To which one might sensibly reply: Good for Greenspan and Safire--and for us. The Federal Reserve's war on inflation and the press corps' scrutiny of powerful people safeguard the country. Some things are worth fighting for, and some things are worth fighting. 

         Vigilance and combat are particularly essential to law enforcement and foreign policy, which must deal with thugs and tyrants, not thoughtless husbands. Tannen laments that cops and soldiers have been ""trained to overcome their resistance to kill"" by trying ""not to think of their opponents as human beings."" She neglects to mention that our safety depends on the ability of these officers to kill their adversaries. Comparing Vietnam to World War II, Tannen focuses strictly on the soldiers' social experience. In World War II, she observes, they trained, served, and went home together. ""Vietnam, in contrast, was a 'lonely war' of individuals assigned to constantly shifting units for year-long tours of duty."" She ignores the more important difference: In World War II, they were fighting Hitler. 

          Tannen doesn't trust in the power of good argumentation to keep society honest, much less correct itself, because she rather shockingly insists """" that people can distinguish lies from the truth. Nor does she trust our competence to manage unfettered communication: ""E-mail makes it too easy to forward messages, too easy to reply before your temper cools, too easy to broadcast messages to large numbers of people without thinking about how every sentence will strike every recipient."" Lexis-Nexis is an equally unwelcome troublemaker: ""Technology also exacerbates the culture of critique by making it much easier for politicians or journalists to ferret out inconsistencies in a public person's statements over time."" 

         Given this oddly paternalistic (or maternalistic) diagnosis, it's not surprising that Tannen should wish to cover our ears, filtering out strife, deception, and debate. She assures us that all reasonable people can agree that disseminating birth control and sex education is the best way to reduce the abortion rate; that stiff sentences for small drug offenses don't reduce drug abuse; that global warming is producing ""disastrous consequences."" Partial-birth abortion is ""surely not"" a ""very important"" issue, and Congress should not have let the Republican ""politics of obstruction"" defeat President Clinton's health care proposal in 1994, given the ""broad bipartisan and public consensus that it was desperately needed."" The ""view of government as the enemy"" isn't worth debating; it's just ""another troubling aspect of the argument culture."" Indeed, Tannen embraces a colleague's claim that ""right-wing talk radio"" deploys phrases ""similar to verbal manipulations employed by propagandists in the Nazi era."" 

         Tannen finds it particularly unseemly that reporters and independent counsels treat the nation's ultimate father figure with such irreverence. She complains that Clinton's weekly radio address ""is followed immediately by a Republican response,"" which ""weakens the public's ability to see leaders as leaders."" A reporter's skeptical question to Clinton ""broke the spell"" of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's remarks upon being nominated to the Supreme Court, thereby injuring citizens' ""sense of connection"" to ""our judicial system."" The investigation of former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was excessive, the campaign against former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was ""cruelly unfair,"" and the Whitewater investigation--led by ""a prominent Republican known for his animosity toward the president""--is, in the words of Arkansas journalist Gene Lyons, ""the result of the nastiest and most successful political 'dirty tricks' campaign in recent American history."" Is Tannen a Clinton apologist? She rules that criticism out of bounds. ""The very fact that defending our nation's elected leader makes one suspect--an 'apologist'--is in itself evidence of the culture of critique,"" she writes. 

         The First Amendment, in Tannen's view, has often become ""a pretext to justify the airing of just those views that make for the most entertaining fights."" As an alternative, she offers Asian authoritarianism: ""Disputation was rejected in ancient China as 'incompatible with the decorum and harmony cultivated by the true sage.' "" Similarly, ""the minimal human unit in Japan is not the individual but the group."" Instead of the American practice of having two guests debate policy questions on TV news programs, she suggests a Japanese format, which ""typically features a single guest."" (Click to learn how she puts this into practice.) 

         Tannen even wants to protect us from the possibility of unpleasant confrontations in the courtroom. ""The purpose of most cross-examinations"" is ""not to establish facts but to discredit the witness,"" she asserts, as though the two objectives were unrelated. Thus, ""the adversary system ... is inhumane to the victims of cross-examination."" She simply assumes the very thing the trial is supposed to prove and what cross-examination might disprove (if this is, in fact, the point of the trial): that the witness is a victim. Conversely, she assumes that the defendant cannot be a victim. While objecting to cross-examination of alleged rape victims because ""it is easy to distort events so that a rape can appear to be consensual sex,"" she ignores the reverse implication--that it is easy to make consensual sex look like rape. She complains that when Anita Hill accused Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, ""Framing these hearings as a two-sides dispute between Hill and Thomas allowed the senators to focus their investigation on cross-examining Hill rather than seeking other sorts of evidence."" Did the dispute not have two sides? Should Hill not have been cross-examined? 

         Instead of the American system, Tannen proposes consideration of the French and German systems. Under French law, after Princess Diana's death: 

         The photographers were held for two days without charges being filed and without being allowed to confer with lawyers. ... The judges do most of the questioning; though lawyers can also ask questions, they cannot cross-examine witnesses. Guilt ... need not be established 'beyond a reasonable doubt' but simply by ... the judge's intimate belief, or deeply held sense, of what happened. 

         Likewise, Tannen recalls the trial of a Canadian man who had denied the Holocaust. The defendant's lawyer interrogated concentration camp survivors, asking whether they had seen their parents gassed. The adversarial system permitted such questions to be asked and answered--admittedly a vexatious experience for the survivors but one that does entail an airing of the facts of the Holocaust. Tannen, however, treats it only as a display of the ""cruelty of cross-examination."" She raises no objection to the Canadian hate-speech ban under which the defendant was prosecuted. Would Tannen argue that the United States should adopt such a law, along with, say, a ban on the cross-examination of accusers? If so, she'd be wrong. But hey, so far, it's still a free country.

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, ""To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!""? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening ""crawl"" begins: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute."" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. 

         Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace , too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given Ed Wood $115 million to remake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like this, although Wood's dialogue would surely have been more memorable. 

         The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucas, who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a movie. Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars (1977) concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out, and overseeing productions that other people storyboard and stage, he has come to lack what one might Michelangelistically term ""the spark of life."" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up. 

         Advance word has been cruel to the actors, but advance word has it only half right. Yes, they're terrible, but Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are not terrible actors, they've just been given scenes that no human could be expected to play. As a sage Jedi Master called Qui-Gon Jinn, Neeson must maintain a Zen-like detachment from the universe around him--probably not a challenge when that universe will be added in later by computers. ""I don't sense anything,"" he tells his uneasy young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), as the two sit waiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray, fish-faced Federation officers who talk like extras in a samurai movie. McGregor furrows his brow. ""There's something ... elusive,"" he says, working to enunciate like a young Alec Guinness but succeeding only in nullifying his natural Scots charm. ""Master,"" he adds, ""you said I should be mindful of the future."" Neeson thinks a bit. ""I do sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute."" 

         A hologram of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the ""Sith,"" commands the Federation to sic its battle droids on the Jedi ambassadors before they can apprise Queen Amidala (Portman) of the imminent invasion of the peaceful planet of Naboo. In come the battle droids and out come the light sabers, which still hum like faulty fluorescents. Clack, clack, clack. Lucas can't edit fight scenes so that they're fluid--he cuts on the clack. You get the gist, though. The Jedi make their getaway, but with gas and tolls and droid destroyers, it takes them over an hour to land on Naboo, by which time the queen and the Galactic Senate have already got the grim message. For one thing, communications have been disrupted: ""A communications disruption can mean only one thing,"" says someone. ""Invasion."" 

         Queen Amidala, done up like a white-faced Chinese empress in hanging beads and glass balls and a hat with curly horns, speaks in tones from which emotion has been expunged, perhaps on the theory that subjects won't argue with a ruler who puts them to sleep: ""I ... will ... not ... condone ... a ... course ... of ... action ... that ... will ... lead ... us ... to ... war,"" she drones. Meanwhile, the Jedi whiz through the underwater core of a planet in a man-of-warlike submersible pursued by 3-D dragony beasties and a giant catfish with extra movable parts. Potentially thrilling stuff, but Neeson and McGregor remain peculiarly unruffled. ""The Force will guide us,"" says Neeson blandly, and the director seems to share his lack of urgency. There's Zen detachment and there's Quaalude detachment, and The Phantom                 Menace falls into the second camp: It really does take place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. When R2-D2 showed up, I thought: At last, a character with the potential for intimacy!              

         Say this for Lucas, he doesn't whip up a lot of bogus energy, the way the makers of such blockbusters as The Mummy (1999) and Armageddon (1998) do. It's as if he conceived The Phantom Menace as a Japanese No pageant and has purposely deadened his actors, directing them to stand stiffly in the dead center of the screen against matte paintings of space or some futuristic metropolis and deliver lines alternately formal or bemusing. (""This is an odd move for the Trade Federation."") Lucas considers himself an ""independent"" filmmaker and an artist of integrity. Had he not been such a pretentious overlord, a platoon of screenwriters would doubtless have been engaged to rewrite him and make the movie halfway human. A buddy specialist would have punched up the Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi badinage, and a black dialogue specialist would have given the comic-relief character, Jar Jar Binks, a man-size dinosaur with pop eyes and a vaguely West Indian patois, something fresher than ""Ex-squeeze me!"" and a lot of Butterfly McQueen-style simpering and running away from battles. Those of us who complain about the assembly-line production of ""blockbuster"" scripts need an occasional reminder that assembly lines can do much to make empty thrill machines more lively. 

                         The Phantom Menace didn't need to be barren of feeling, but it took a real writer, Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill , 1983), to draft the best and most inspiring of the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a real director, Irvin Kershner, to breathe Wagnerian grandeur into Lucas' cartoonish fantasies. Having lived with the saga for so many years, the audience was prepared to set aside some of its narrative expectations here to plumb the origins of Lucas' universe. In The Phantom Menace , however, the Jedi already exist and the Force is taken for granted--we're still in the middle of the damn story. The only dramatic interest comes from a young Tatooine slave named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom we know will grow up to father Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and then surrender to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader. But that transformation won't happen until the third episode; meanwhile, Anakin is a conventionally industrious juvenile with a penchant for building droids from scratch and ""pod racing""--an activity that he demonstrates in one of the movie's most impressive but irrelevant special effects set pieces, a whiplash hyperdrive permutation of the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959). 

         Later in the film, when Anakin goes before something called the Jedi Council and meets Yoda and Samuel L. Jackson (together again!), Lucas dramatizes the interrogation so ineptly that you either have to take Yoda's word that there's something wrong with the boy (""Clouded this boy's future is"") or to conclude that Yoda, like us, is moving backward through time and has already seen Episodes 4 through 6. Anakin, he says smugly, has fear in him, and fear leads to anger and anger to the dark side--which would mean, as I interpret it, that only people without fear (i.e., people who don't exist) are suitable candidates for Jedi knighthood (perhaps Yoda will enlarge his definition of fear in subsequent episodes). There's also some quasireligious, quasiscientific blather to the effect that the boy was conceived without a father by ""metachorians""--symbiont, microscopic life forms that will speak to you if you ""quiet your mind."" In other words, the Force. So, it's not nebulous, after all! It can be measured. It can be quantified. It can even, perhaps, be merchandised. 

         Yes, the effects are first-rate, occasionally breathtaking. But the floating platforms in the Galactic Senate do little to distract you from parliamentary machinations that play like an especially dull day on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine . The final military engagement, in which long-headed attack droids are rolled onto the field as the spokes of a giant wheel, would be awesome if Lucas didn't routinely cut away from the battle just when he seems on the verge of actually thrilling you. The chief villain, bombastically named Darth Maul, is a horned, red, Kabuki-style snake demon with orange pingpong-ball eyes who challenges the Jedi to a couple of clackety light-saber battles. His appearances are underscored by demonic chants; he might as well wear a neon beanie that flashes ""Bad Guy."" Like all revisionist historians, Lucas cheats like mad. If Darth Vader had built C-3PO as a young man, how come he never paid much attention to him in the other movies--and vice versa? As Yoda himself puts it, in another context, ""See through you we can."" 

          Still, it's worth reprinting a blistering e-mail sent to my wife by a relative, after she'd let him know that I hated The Phantom Menace : 

                         Surprise, Surprise. Star Wars was never reviewed well by critics. Sometimes a basic story that rests on great special effects and stupid dialogue can be very entertaining--it's called a cult movie, and no critic can have an effect on the obvious outcome that this is going to be the highest grossing movie ever. I myself stood in line for five hours and already have tickets to see it three times, and I know I'll enjoy it. Why? Because it plays on my childhood imagination. And I'm sure it's not as bad as Return of the Jedi , which was the weakest one--but I still liked it and saw it a dozen times. I get tired of being told I'm not going to like it because it doesn't adhere to certain basic critic criteria. I say bpthhhh (sticking my tongue out to review)--don't be sending me anything dissing my movie:):):)              

         I'll be curious to know whether he sees The Phantom Menace a dozen times, or even the three for which he has paid. (I could imagine seeing it three times only if they sold adrenaline shots at the concession stand.) Or maybe he'll come out of the movie and say: ""No, you didn't get it, Mr. Snot-Nosed-Criteria Critic Person. It's not supposed to be exciting. It's laying the foundation for the next chapter, when Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat the Mandalorian warriors in the Clone Wars and Anakin marries Queen Amidala. And listen, I'm getting in line even earlier for tickets to Episode 2 . The Force is with me, butt-head.""

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, ""To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!""? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening ""crawl"" begins: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute."" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. 

         Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace , too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given Ed Wood $115 million to remake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like this, although Wood's dialogue would surely have been more memorable. 

         The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucas, who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a movie. Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars (1977) concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out, and overseeing productions that other people storyboard and stage, he has come to lack what one might Michelangelistically term ""the spark of life."" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up.

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the ""intra-oral camera."" As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. ""You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth,"" says one recent victim of the camera. ""You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth."" 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funded dental-school construction, spilling new dentists into a saturated market. Many found themselves cleaning teeth for $10 an hour in mall clinics. In 1984, Forbes magazine forecast the end of the profession. Only a few lonely dentists would survive to fill the few remaining cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on Long Island. 

         Instead, the number of dentists has jumped 20 percent, and the average salary soared from $76,000 in 1987 to $124,000 in 1996. What happened? In part, the oversupply of dentists and the declining demand for fillings forced the profession to change. Dentists had to become nicer and visits less unpleasant. The Marathon Man has been replaced by Dr. Soothe. ""People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an ass, patients would not come to you,"" says Dr. William Hartel, a St. Louis dentist. Many dentists' offices let you don virtual reality glasses and watch movies on them. Others offer massage therapy and hot tubs. Does your dentist have a certificate of pain management on her wall? I bet she does. 

         The most important discovery dentists made was the endless vanity of aging baby boomers. ""We are dealing now with the boomers who are the runners and the joggers and the dieters, and they are very concerned with how they look,"" says American Dental Association President Dr. Timothy Rose. Since going to the dentist was no longer a necessary evil, dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied themselves with the self-improvement movement. ""You still go for the needs, for the cavity that has to get filled, but more and more people ... come here to feel better about themselves,"" says Dr. Stephen Friedman, a Maryland dentist. 

         People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough choppers to chew. But boomers, lured by media images of the Great American Smile, expect more. According to an ADA poll, the percentage of people who are ""very satisfied"" with their teeth has dropped from 57 percent to 46 percent in the past decade. Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety, encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractive to patients. ""It's as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a disease and he said you needed a nose job,"" says Dr. John Dodes, author of Healthy Teeth: A User's Manual . 

         To flog $500 teeth whitenings and multi-thousand dollar adult orthodontic treatments, dentists run computer simulations of your whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is measured on a scale that starts at A1. ""My dentist showed me these disgusting color charts and told me, 'You're an A2 now, but by the time you want to get married you are going to be an A4. And no one wants to marry an A4,' "" says one woman who got her teeth bleached. Dentists also prod patients to replace perfectly functional gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic ones and to dump their solid gold crowns for white porcelain. Other dentists sell the psychology of tooth appearance. One dentist specializing in porcelain caps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem ""weak."" 

         Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medical scare talk. A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him to whiten his teeth as a ""preventive measure."" (To prevent what? Yellow teeth?) Many dentists claim, without scientific evidence, that the mercury in amalgam fillings is dangerous. They urge patients to replace the excellent amalgam with plastic fillings at four times the price. 

         Dentists make a killing on bad breath--or ""halitosis,"" as they prefer to call it. Breath clinics have sprouted up all over the country and are heavily advertised on the Web. They terrify patients with a ""halimeter,"" a new gadget that measures a nasty smelling chemical called methyl mercaptan. Armed with the halimeter proof, the dentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue scrapers in front of the patient. Never mind that you can get the same results for free with careful brushing and basic tongue-scraping. The machine makes the sale. ""Now that there is this machine that can document your complaint and can put a number on it, it motivates a patient to actually do something about it. But the treatments available now are the same ones that have been available for 15 years,"" says Hartel. 

         Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care with trained aggression. Dental management organizations often require their employees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward profitable cosmetics. Ads in the Journal of the American Dental Association and on the Web promote tapes and classes on marketing techniques. One person I know quit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in the office instructing the dentist in how to get his patients to ""trade up"" to more expensive treatment. The ADA's annual conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as ""how to move your patients to 'yes.' "" 

         The industry calls this technique ""treatment acceptance,"" a marvelous euphemism for parting you from your money. According to the ADA's journal, this year's ADA conference will include an all-day ""Treatment Acceptance"" seminar ""for the dental team that is fed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or asking for alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire team in creating the strategies for patients to accept optimum care."" 

         This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it isn't in other medicine because of the profession's brutal economics. Dental insurance covers only 44 percent of Americans (compared to more than 80 percent for health insurance), and provides skimpy coverage for those who do have it. As a result, patients pay most dental costs--about 60 percent of them--out of their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to spend discretionary income, competing with a vacation or a new car. Dentists have to make patients want adult orthodontics in a way physicians don't have to make patients want a quadruple bypass. 

         It's tempting to dismiss the whole industry as a scam, particularly when dentists keep coming up with new ailments such as bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal disease, malocclusion (bad bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A generation ago, dentists filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all they knew. Decay killed so many teeth that fancier problems seldom arose. Since then, researchers have studied bonding, implants, and periodontal disease. Dentists can now make crowns that last forever, bridges that stay anchored, dentures that behave almost like real teeth. A generation ago, implants were a joke. Today's implants, affixed to your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of your life. 

         Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gaps in the gum, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder teeth. New research links these periodontal bacteria to heart disease, diabetes, low birth-weight babies, and other nastiness you'd expect from bacteria running wild in the bloodstream. This is why your dentist hectors you to rubber-tip your gums, brush with a superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wear a night guard to control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between teeth and gum, etc.). It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery. It all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night guard is ""an excellent form of birth control,"" as one wearer puts it--but the alternative is losing your teeth at 40, getting dentures, and gumming your food. Dentistry is a hassle now because it works. 

         ""If you think back a couple of generations, it was considered inevitable that people would lose their teeth when they reached midlife. Around 40 or 45, you would have your teeth taken out. Periodontal disease was not understood, and decay was rampant. But now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime. I have gone in 18 years from learning how to make dentures and thinking it is OK for people to lose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses teeth. It is a failure,"" says Dr. Judith Penski, my own fabulous D.C. dentist. 

         Which brings us to the irony of dentistry's comeback: Just as patients love the dental care they should suspect, they resent the care they should appreciate. Aesthetic dentistry is the most profitable segment of the business because it is an easy sell. Put a camera in your mouth and you'll want whiter teeth, too. It is much harder to convince someone to poke her gums every night with a piece of rubber, to sleep with a choking plastic tooth guard, and to undergo four surgeries to fix a gum flap, all for a benefit that is decades away. The very success of dentistry has raised expectations so high that patients now object to any inconvenience. Americans under 60 believe keeping all their teeth is an entitlement: Telling them they need gum surgery to preserve their teeth makes them angry, not grateful--even though those teeth would have been goners 20 years ago. 

         When I surveyed 100 friends and acquaintances about their dental complaints, few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foisted on them. They like their whiter, straighter teeth. No, they griped about the medically advisable treatments that their dentists prescribed, especially gum surgeries and mouth guards. Pity the poor dentist who abjures cosmetic dentistry but vigorously protects patients' teeth. Patients don't like periodontal treatment, so they suspect it's a rip-off. This could not be further from the truth. 

         ""Dentists are aware of providing what patients want,"" says Hartel. ""I had a woman come in with a terrible toothache. She needed a root canal, but she did not want it. But she did want her teeth bleached, and she paid cash for it.""

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the ""intra-oral camera."" As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. ""You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth,"" says one recent victim of the camera. ""You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth."" 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funded dental-school construction, spilling new dentists into a saturated market. Many found themselves cleaning teeth for $10 an hour in mall clinics. In 1984, Forbes magazine forecast the end of the profession. Only a few lonely dentists would survive to fill the few remaining cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on Long Island. 

         Instead, the number of dentists has jumped 20 percent, and the average salary soared from $76,000 in 1987 to $124,000 in 1996. What happened? In part, the oversupply of dentists and the declining demand for fillings forced the profession to change. Dentists had to become nicer and visits less unpleasant. The Marathon Man has been replaced by Dr. Soothe. ""People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an ass, patients would not come to you,"" says Dr. William Hartel, a St. Louis dentist. Many dentists' offices let you don virtual reality glasses and watch movies on them. Others offer massage therapy and hot tubs. Does your dentist have a certificate of pain management on her wall? I bet she does. 

         The most important discovery dentists made was the endless vanity of aging baby boomers. ""We are dealing now with the boomers who are the runners and the joggers and the dieters, and they are very concerned with how they look,"" says American Dental Association President Dr. Timothy Rose. Since going to the dentist was no longer a necessary evil, dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied themselves with the self-improvement movement. ""You still go for the needs, for the cavity that has to get filled, but more and more people ... come here to feel better about themselves,"" says Dr. Stephen Friedman, a Maryland dentist. 

         People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough choppers to chew. But boomers, lured by media images of the Great American Smile, expect more. According to an ADA poll, the percentage of people who are ""very satisfied"" with their teeth has dropped from 57 percent to 46 percent in the past decade. Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety, encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractive to patients. ""It's as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a disease and he said you needed a nose job,"" says Dr. John Dodes, author of Healthy Teeth: A User's Manual . 

         To flog $500 teeth whitenings and multi-thousand dollar adult orthodontic treatments, dentists run computer simulations of your whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is measured on a scale that starts at A1. ""My dentist showed me these disgusting color charts and told me, 'You're an A2 now, but by the time you want to get married you are going to be an A4. And no one wants to marry an A4,' "" says one woman who got her teeth bleached. Dentists also prod patients to replace perfectly functional gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic ones and to dump their solid gold crowns for white porcelain. Other dentists sell the psychology of tooth appearance. One dentist specializing in porcelain caps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem ""weak."" 

         Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medical scare talk. A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him to whiten his teeth as a ""preventive measure."" (To prevent what? Yellow teeth?) Many dentists claim, without scientific evidence, that the mercury in amalgam fillings is dangerous. They urge patients to replace the excellent amalgam with plastic fillings at four times the price. 

         Dentists make a killing on bad breath--or ""halitosis,"" as they prefer to call it. Breath clinics have sprouted up all over the country and are heavily advertised on the Web. They terrify patients with a ""halimeter,"" a new gadget that measures a nasty smelling chemical called methyl mercaptan. Armed with the halimeter proof, the dentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue scrapers in front of the patient. Never mind that you can get the same results for free with careful brushing and basic tongue-scraping. The machine makes the sale. ""Now that there is this machine that can document your complaint and can put a number on it, it motivates a patient to actually do something about it. But the treatments available now are the same ones that have been available for 15 years,"" says Hartel. 

         Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care with trained aggression. Dental management organizations often require their employees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward profitable cosmetics. Ads in the Journal of the American Dental Association and on the Web promote tapes and classes on marketing techniques. One person I know quit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in the office instructing the dentist in how to get his patients to ""trade up"" to more expensive treatment. The ADA's annual conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as ""how to move your patients to 'yes.' "" 

         The industry calls this technique ""treatment acceptance,"" a marvelous euphemism for parting you from your money. According to the ADA's journal, this year's ADA conference will include an all-day ""Treatment Acceptance"" seminar ""for the dental team that is fed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or asking for alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire team in creating the strategies for patients to accept optimum care."" 

         This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it isn't in other medicine because of the profession's brutal economics. Dental insurance covers only 44 percent of Americans (compared to more than 80 percent for health insurance), and provides skimpy coverage for those who do have it. As a result, patients pay most dental costs--about 60 percent of them--out of their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to spend discretionary income, competing with a vacation or a new car. Dentists have to make patients want adult orthodontics in a way physicians don't have to make patients want a quadruple bypass. 

         It's tempting to dismiss the whole industry as a scam, particularly when dentists keep coming up with new ailments such as bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal disease, malocclusion (bad bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A generation ago, dentists filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all they knew. Decay killed so many teeth that fancier problems seldom arose. Since then, researchers have studied bonding, implants, and periodontal disease. Dentists can now make crowns that last forever, bridges that stay anchored, dentures that behave almost like real teeth. A generation ago, implants were a joke. Today's implants, affixed to your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of your life. 

         Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gaps in the gum, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder teeth. New research links these periodontal bacteria to heart disease, diabetes, low birth-weight babies, and other nastiness you'd expect from bacteria running wild in the bloodstream. This is why your dentist hectors you to rubber-tip your gums, brush with a superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wear a night guard to control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between teeth and gum, etc.). It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery. It all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night guard is ""an excellent form of birth control,"" as one wearer puts it--but the alternative is losing your teeth at 40, getting dentures, and gumming your food. Dentistry is a hassle now because it works. 

         ""If you think back a couple of generations, it was considered inevitable that people would lose their teeth when they reached midlife. Around 40 or 45, you would have your teeth taken out. Periodontal disease was not understood, and decay was rampant. But now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime. I have gone in 18 years from learning how to make dentures and thinking it is OK for people to lose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses teeth. It is a failure,"" says Dr. Judith Penski, my own fabulous D.C. dentist. 

         Which brings us to the irony of dentistry's comeback: Just as patients love the dental care they should suspect, they resent the care they should appreciate. Aesthetic dentistry is the most profitable segment of the business because it is an easy sell. Put a camera in your mouth and you'll want whiter teeth, too. It is much harder to convince someone to poke her gums every night with a piece of rubber, to sleep with a choking plastic tooth guard, and to undergo four surgeries to fix a gum flap, all for a benefit that is decades away. The very success of dentistry has raised expectations so high that patients now object to any inconvenience. Americans under 60 believe keeping all their teeth is an entitlement: Telling them they need gum surgery to preserve their teeth makes them angry, not grateful--even though those teeth would have been goners 20 years ago. 

         When I surveyed 100 friends and acquaintances about their dental complaints, few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foisted on them. They like their whiter, straighter teeth. No, they griped about the medically advisable treatments that their dentists prescribed, especially gum surgeries and mouth guards. Pity the poor dentist who abjures cosmetic dentistry but vigorously protects patients' teeth. Patients don't like periodontal treatment, so they suspect it's a rip-off. This could not be further from the truth. 

         ""Dentists are aware of providing what patients want,"" says Hartel. ""I had a woman come in with a terrible toothache. She needed a root canal, but she did not want it. But she did want her teeth bleached, and she paid cash for it."" 

         Such is the triumph of American dentists: If they can't sell you what you need, they'll sell you what you want.

26,"Kick Me 

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of balance? Take karate. Do you want to know what to do if someone tries to choke you? Take jujitsu. Just remember that if you're jumped by a mugger, the only thing Tae-Bo will be good for is making your attacker collapse into uncontrollable fits of laughter. 

          

            Kung Fu              

          

            Reputation: 1960s martial arts movies; Bruce Lee. 

                         Intimidation Factor: 4              

         In the all-levels group I observed at Seven Star Women's Kung Fu, there were a dozen or so women dressed completely in black. (Most classes I took were co-ed.) The school wouldn't let me take the class--I could only watch--but that was better than Temple Kung Fu, which made me sit for an interview before they'd even reveal any information on their classes. There seemed to be an active screening process to keep out those with only a casual interest. 

                         Strength Workout: 3              

         After meditating for a few minutes, students launched into traditional strengthening exercises (push-ups and sit-ups) and then broke into pairs, with one person kicking pads held by the other. It looked to be decent strength training. Their arms got a good workout from the push-ups and punching; abs, from the sit-ups; and the lower body, from the kicking. It was not extreme, and nobody seemed exhausted. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 2              

         After the strength work and partner work, the class broke into a few groups (according to skill level) and repeated choreographed routines called ""kata ,"" which involve a series of punches, kicks, and blocks with an imaginary foe. The class had broken into a light sweat, but was not gasping for air. 

                         Coordination and Balance:                 4              

         The rounded slinky movements of the dancelike kata looked specifically designed to develop grace, coordination, and balance. 

                         Degree of Contact: 1              

         Almost none. No direct body-to-body contact, but plenty of punching and kicking with pads. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 2              

         The moves were neat to look at, but they did not seem practical. And without sparring practice, it would be difficult to apply the drills in real life. 

          

            Overall: Kicking, punching, and an aura of mystery. 

          

            Tae Kwon Do              

          

            Reputation: World's most popular martial art, new Olympic sport; lots of kicking; the martial art of the 1990s. 

                         Intimidation Factor: 1              

         I was instantly welcomed into the beginners class at Lee's Martial Arts. People called each other by their first name; there was laughing, joking, and none of the aloofness or self-importance of the kung fu class. 

                         Strength Workout: 3              

         This rating is a little misleading. The lower-body strength workout was fantastic--my legs and hips were sore for days--but there was almost no strength training for the upper body. We used our arms only for balance and blocking kicks. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 5              

         We began with everyone standing in lines and kicking into the air. Then we did a long series of running drills up and down the mats. Then there was more kicking: Turning kicks, straight kicks, low kicks, kicks with punching bags, kicks with partners â€¦ the list goes on. It was an excellent workout. 

                         Coordination and Balance: 4              

         Learning how to make contact with the pad (and not, say, the face of the person holding it) was important. Balance was crucial in the sparring. 

                         Degree of Contact: 4              

         At the end of class came a session of sparring (which I, alas, was not allowed to participate in). The students strapped on protective chest pads and helmets and began kicking the stuffing out of each other. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 4              

         Tae kwon do emphasizes sparring and gets students accustomed to dealing with an assault. 

          

            Overall: More a sport than an art; will make short work of flabby legs. 

          

            Karate              

          

            Reputation: Ralph Macchio in The                 Karate Kid ; the martial art of the 1980s. 

                         Intimidation Factor: 1              

         When I watched a class at the Feminist Karate Union, I asked some of the students how their class was different from the Seven Star Women's Kung Fu class, which is held in the same building. One woman immediately said, ""Oh, kung fu? That's what the mean people downstairs do."" This class was approachable and open. And karate's so familiar that you feel like you already know how to do it. 

                         Strength Workout: 2              

         We started with sit-ups and push-ups, which were the most demanding parts of the class. The kicking and punching made for decent exercise, but I wasn't aching the next day. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 3              

         The drills (lots of punches, blocking, and kicking) provided some aerobic workout, but were not particularly intense. 

                         Coordination and Balance: 4              

         Keeping yourself centered while kicking and punching develops your balance. 

                         Degree of Contact: 2              

         There was some contact in the paired kicking drills with a partner and pads, but most of the physical contact came during the sparring. Yet this was nothing like the tae kwon do sparring: They weren't clocking each other, just repeating the motions of punching and blocking over and over again. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 2              

         This was entirely focused on form; no full-force contact between students. 

          

            Overall: Kicks and punches galore, with a dash of moral and spiritual teaching about self-discipline and obedience.

                         Intimidation Factor: 1              

         Despite its reputation, aikido is decidedly nonaggressive--it's about deflecting punches and immobilizing your attacker--and there was a mellow, pleasantly upbeat atmosphere to the class. 

                         Strength Workout: 3              

         No sit-ups or push-ups, but pulling and yanking on other people looked like it would build muscle, and the rolls worked on your abs. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 2              

         There was little aerobic work, save for the rolling on the mats (which may explain Seagal's ever-increasing flabbiness). 

                         Coordination and Balance: 5              

         The goal is to destabilize and control the other guy, so maintaining your balance--and learning to topple your opponent--is crucial. 

                         Degree of Contact: 4              

         To complete the partner exercises, you had to grab your partner, spin him this way and that, and generally come in very close contact. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 5              

         Learning how to neutralize a threat was the main goal of the class. 

          

            Overall: You don't get to land any punches and it's noncompetitive, but you'll learn how to knock people over.

                         Strength Workout: 2              

         While my heart didn't get pumping, the slow, controlled movements did give my arms, legs, back, and stomach a good resistance workout. You may just be working against gravity, but holding your arms up in the air for several minutes will give you a new appreciation for those slow-moving people in the park. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 0              

         Tai chi involves moving your body slowly in circular patterns, shifting weight from foot to foot, and lifting your arms in rounded gestures, all at a pace slower than you ever thought possible. The motions had names like ""parting the wild horse's mane"" and ""repulsing the monkey."" I did not break a sweat, but I was bored to tears. 

                         Coordination and Balance: 4              

         Balance and control of your body position are the heart of this art.

                         Self-Defense Value: 0              

         I learned how to repulse a monkey, not a person. 

          

            Overall: A yawner, slightly embarrassing to perform, but I'm sure if done correctly it brings high-quality inner peace.

                         Intimidation Factor: 5              

         Although the listing in the phone book advertised the ""Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Academy,"" the sign on the door said ""Northwest Fight Club."" Inside the club, huge holes had been punched in the walls--some back-size, some fist-size. Huge letters painted on the wall said ""TRAIN &amp; FIGHT HARD."" The instructor, a handsome young Brazilian man, had a long scar curling out from the left side of his mouth and a fresh-looking purple one by his left eye. When I asked to try the class, he shrugged and lent me a gi (the white outfit most martial artists wear), on the back of which was a drawing of massive snarling pit bull and the slogan ""PIT PULLING PURE POWER."" I wondered if I was going to need an ambulance to take me home. 

                         Strength Workout: 5              

         The next day every inch of my body was sore--my stomach, arms, legs, feet, and neck. For Olympians only. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 5              

         This ranks as one of the hardest and most complete workouts I've ever had. After some stretching, we launched directly into hundreds of lightning-fast sit-ups, crunches, push-ups, leg lifts, and scissor kicks. I was quickly panting and my face turned a deep fuchsia. We did forward and backward rolls, learned to escape from various holds, and executed the sort of belly-crawl that marines always seem to be doing in movies about basic training. After an hour and a half I felt close to death, but there was still another hour to go. 

                         Coordination and Balance: 2              

         Coordination is important, but since you're tussling on a mat most of the time, balance isn't. 

                         Degree of Contact: 5              

         After drills, the instructor paired me with Isabella for partner work. He demonstrated how to get Isabella into choke-holds and leg-locks, as well as how to escape from them. We practiced on each other. It was a little unnerving to be choking Isabella so soon after meeting her, but she didn't seem to mind. I learned how to go from sitting on top of her with a knee in her stomach to a position where her arm was between my legs and I could break it over my stomach. The end of the class was spent with full-on grappling. Getting your face mashed into someone's armpit was de rigueur . 

                         Self-Defense Value: 5              

         Jujitsu's few-holds-barred grappling is far more effective when push comes to shove (and worse) than standing arts such as karate. 

                         Overall: Lots of grappling, throwing, and choking. Pragmatic, not pretty. High badass quotient.

         Not long ago, out of curiosity, I picked up some exercise videos by Billy Blanks, the king of Tae-Bo. What a flop. The sets were cheesy, the music was awful 1980s synth-pop, and despite their martial-arts pretensions, the routines felt more like aerobics in disguise than like kung fu. But after flailing away in my living room for a few nights, my interest was piqued, and I decided to find out more about the real thing. Which martial art teaches good self-defense tactics? Which one would give me a good aerobic workout? How daunting would it be to jump into a class as a complete beginner? And would I get pummeled by the other students? 

         To find out, I tried a handful of karate, tae kwon do, aikido, jujitsu, and kung fu classes in the Seattle area. I scored each one in several areas: how intimidating the class would be to a novice; how much the exercises worked my muscles; how much of an I got; whether it would develop coordination and balance; how much physical contact with other people was involved; and, of course, its value in self-defense. All ratings are on a scale of one to five, with five being the hardest, most intimidating, or most valuable. 

         To experts, this will look like a hopelessly biased and superficial inquiry. It is. But to beginners, it is one step toward figuring out which martial art might be right for you. Do you want a chance to kick the stuffing out of someone? Take tae kwon do. Do you want to improve your sense of balance? Take karate. Do you want to know what to do if someone tries to choke you? Take jujitsu. Just remember that if you're jumped by a mugger, the only thing Tae-Bo will be good for is making your attacker collapse into uncontrollable fits of laughter.

         In the all-levels group I observed at Seven Star Women's Kung Fu, there were a dozen or so women dressed completely in black. (Most classes I took were co-ed.) The school wouldn't let me take the class--I could only watch--but that was better than Temple Kung Fu, which made me sit for an interview before they'd even reveal any information on their classes. There seemed to be an active screening process to keep out those with only a casual interest.

         After meditating for a few minutes, students launched into traditional strengthening exercises (push-ups and sit-ups) and then broke into pairs, with one person kicking pads held by the other. It looked to be decent strength training. Their arms got a good workout from the push-ups and punching; abs, from the sit-ups; and the lower body, from the kicking. It was not extreme, and nobody seemed exhausted. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 2              

         After the strength work and partner work, the class broke into a few groups (according to skill level) and repeated choreographed routines called ""kata ,"" which involve a series of punches, kicks, and blocks with an imaginary foe. The class had broken into a light sweat, but was not gasping for air. 

                         Coordination and Balance:                 4              

         The rounded slinky movements of the dancelike kata looked specifically designed to develop grace, coordination, and balance. 

                         Degree of Contact: 1              

         Almost none. No direct body-to-body contact, but plenty of punching and kicking with pads. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 2              

         The moves were neat to look at, but they did not seem practical. And without sparring practice, it would be difficult to apply the drills in real life. 

          

            Overall: Kicking, punching, and an aura of mystery.

         I was instantly welcomed into the beginners class at Lee's Martial Arts. People called each other by their first name; there was laughing, joking, and none of the aloofness or self-importance of the kung fu class. 

                         Strength Workout: 3              

         This rating is a little misleading. The lower-body strength workout was fantastic--my legs and hips were sore for days--but there was almost no strength training for the upper body. We used our arms only for balance and blocking kicks. 

                         Aerobic Workout: 5              

         We began with everyone standing in lines and kicking into the air. Then we did a long series of running drills up and down the mats. Then there was more kicking: Turning kicks, straight kicks, low kicks, kicks with punching bags, kicks with partners â€¦ the list goes on. It was an excellent workout. 

                         Coordination and Balance: 4              

         Learning how to make contact with the pad (and not, say, the face of the person holding it) was important. Balance was crucial in the sparring. 

                         Degree of Contact: 4              

         At the end of class came a session of sparring (which I, alas, was not allowed to participate in). The students strapped on protective chest pads and helmets and began kicking the stuffing out of each other. 

                         Self-Defense Value: 4              

         Tae kwon do emphasizes sparring and gets students accustomed to dealing with an assault.

         When I watched a class at the Feminist Karate Union, I asked some of the students how their class was different from the Seven Star Women's Kung Fu class, which is held in the same building. One woman immediately said, ""Oh, kung fu? That's what the mean people downstairs do."" This class was approachable and open. And karate's so familiar that you feel like you already know how to do it.

27,"I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist. And, as it also turned out, he didn't really feel bad for saying what he said. In fact, he was more convinced than ever that the Antichrist is a Jew who walks among us. 

         Let me pause for a moment to give three concise reasons why I'm so curious about the identity of the Antichrist: 

         1) I think I speak for all the approximately 4.5 million adult male Jews in the world when I say that we get a little antsy when Christians start looking at us like we're the devil. This is on account of Christian behavior over the past 2,000 years, by which I mean blood libels and pogroms and inquisitions, those sorts of things. 

         2) I've always been possessed by the delusional notion that I am to play a major role in world history, so why not a role in the End of Days? And I don't mean the Schwarzenegger movie. 

         3) Now that we stand on the lip of the millennium, much of the evangelical Christian world is in the grip of Armageddon fever, and, according to the evangelical interpretation of the books of Daniel and Revelation, the Antichrist will make his appearance before Christ makes his, and his is looking kinda imminent. The Antichrist, in this reading, will be a world leader who strikes a peace deal with Israel, only to betray the Jewish state and make war on it, until Jesus comes to the rescue. The thankful Jews, those who are still alive, will then become Christians and live happily ever after. These beliefs, held by tens of millions of Christians are, journalistically speaking, worthy of note. 

         The day before my visit with the Rev. Falwell, I had just finished reading a novelistic treatment of these events, Assassins , which is subtitled Assignment: Jerusalem, Target: Antichrist . Assassins is the sixth book in the ""Left Behind"" series, ""left behind"" referring to those unfortunate nonevangelical Christians who are not taken up to heaven in the Rapture--the opening act in God's end days plan--and are forced to contend with the Antichrist's evil reign on Earth. The ""Left Behind"" series, co-written by Tim LaHaye, the prominent right-wing screwball and husband of Beverly LaHaye, the even more prominent right-wing screwball, and Jerry B. Jenkins, who, his biography states, is the author of 130 books, which is a lot of books for one guy to write, is a phenomenon. Ten million copies of the series have sold already--hundreds in my local PriceClub alone. ""Left Behind"" is the Harry Potter of the Armageddon set. 

         The notable thing for me about the ""Left Behind"" series--beside the fact that few in the secular media have noticed that millions of Americans are busy reading books warning about the imminence of one-world government, mass death, and the return of the Messiah, is that all the Jewish characters are Christian. LaHaye and Jenkins are both active participants in the absurd and feverish campaign by some evangelical Christians to redefine Judaism in a way that allows for belief in Jesus. 

         Jews (and again, I feel comfortable speaking for all of us here) find this sort of Christian imperialism just a wee bit offensive. Just imagine if Jews began an official campaign calling Muhammad irrelevant to Islam--can you imagine the fatwas that would produce? 

         But evangelical leaders, who are, in my experience, uniformly kind and generous in their personal relations, can also be terribly obnoxious in their relations with Jews. 

         There is only one road to salvation for Jews, and that road runs through Jesus, LaHaye told me. To his credit, though, LaHaye doesn't believe that the Antichrist will be Jewish. He will be a European gentile, who will kill lots of Jews. ""The Jews will be forced to accept the idolatry of the Antichrist or be beheaded,"" he said. This will take place during the seven-year Tribulation. 

         Jewish suffering, though, is divinely ordained. Even though the Antichrist will not be Jewish, Jews are still capable of great evil and have often been punished for their evil, LaHaye explained. ""Some of the greatest evil in the history of the world was concocted in the Jewish mind,"" LaHaye told me, for reasons that aren't entirely clear--he knew what the name ""Goldberg"" generally signifies. ""Sigmund Freud, Marx, these were Jewish minds that were infected with atheism."" 

         I asked LaHaye to tell me more about the Jewish mind. 

         ""The Jewish brain also has the capacity for great good,"" he explained. ""God gave the Jews great intelligence. He didn't give them great size or physical power--you don't see too many Jews in the NFL--but he gave them great minds."" 

         Of all the evangelical leaders I have interviewed, LaHaye is capable of some of the most anti-Semitic utterances, which is troublesome, because he is also the most popular author in the evangelical world. 

         The Rev. Falwell is smoother than LaHaye. He acknowledges ""where the sensitivity comes from,"" though he shows no understanding of the role the myth of the Antichrist played in the history of anti-Semitism, and he refuses to back away from his opinion that somewhere in Great Neck or West L.A. or Shaker Heights is living Satan's agent. 

         ""In my opinion,"" he told me, ""the Antichrist will be a counterfeit of the true Christ, which means that he will be male and Jewish, since Jesus was male and Jewish."" 

         I asked him if he understood that such statements strip Jews of their humanity, which is the first step anti-Semites take before they kill them. He responded, ""All the Jewish people we do business with on a daily basis, not one has ever got upset over this."" It is not Jews who picked this most recent fight, he said, it is supporters of President Clinton. 

         ""Billy Graham made the same statement a dozen times last year, but there was no comment about that,"" Falwell said. ""But Billy Graham was not calling for the resignation of the president."" Falwell, you'll recall, is no fan of Clinton's; he has even peddled a video accusing the president of murder. 

         Falwell is right: Evangelical preachers are constantly accusing the Jews of harboring the Antichrist. 

         I asked Falwell if he knew the actual identity of the Antichrist. No, he said. ""People might say, it's a certain person, it's Henry Kissinger, like that, but the Lord does not let us know that."" 

         So there's a chance, then, that I'm the Antichrist? 

         Falwell chuckled a condescending chuckle. ""It's almost amusing, that question. Of course not. I know that you're not."" 

         Why? 

         ""The Antichrist will be a world leader, he'll have supernatural powers,"" he said. 

         He got me there--I have no supernatural powers. I can't even drive a stick shift. 

         I pressed him further on the identity of the Antichrist, but Falwell wouldn't play. ""We'll know the Antichrist when he arrives,"" he said. 

         Most evangelical leaders, in fact, refuse to publicly guess the name of the Antichrist--though, as Falwell suggests, Kissinger is a perennial favorite, at least among those evangelicals who believe the Antichrist will be Jewish. For most of their history, Christian leaders had been content to ascribe the characteristics of the Antichrist to the Jewish people as a whole. ""Ever since the 2 nd century CE, the very beginning of the Antichrist legend, Christians have associated Jews with everything unholy,"" Andrew Gow, who teaches Christian history at the University of Alberta, told me. In the minds of early Christian leaders, the church was the new Israel; God's covenant with the Jews was obsolete. Therefore, the Jews who remained on Earth were there to serve devilish purposes, Gow explained. 

         There are plenty of evangelical thinkers who differ with Falwell, who believe, like LaHaye, that the Antichrist will be a gentile who rises out of Europe. ""The Antichrist is supposed to make a peace treaty with Israel,"" Ed Hindson, the author of Is the Antichrist Alive and Well? , explained. ""Why would a Jew make a peace treaty with a Jewish state?"" 

         Hindson suggested that Satan will make the Antichrist the leader of the European Union--the revived Roman Empire, eternal enemy of Israel--though Hindson disputed one popular idea advocated by Monte Judah, an Oklahoma-based prophecy-teacher, that Prince Charles is the Antichrist. 

         ""There's no way Prince Charles is the Antichrist,"" Hindson said. ""Satan can do better than that."" 

         In his book, Hindson runs through a list of potential candidates. Bill Clinton is there, of course, as well as Saddam Hussein and Ronald Wilson Reagan (six letters in each of his three names. Get it?). 

         Of course, none of these men are gay. 

         ""It says in the Bible that the Antichrist will have 'no regard for women,' and so many evangelicals interpret that to mean that he will be a homosexual,"" Hindson said, though he added that he's not entirely convinced. 

         This idea--the Antichrist as gay--strikes a chord with many evangelicals, just as the idea that the Antichrist is Jewish strikes a chord. 

         I gradually came to see how far-fetched it was to think that I might be the Antichrist. I'm not gay, I'm not famous, I wouldn't know a euro if I found one in my wallet. 

         Then it struck me: Barry Diller is the Antichrist. 

         There's no way to know for sure. But if you wake up one morning to read that Barry Diller is the head of the European Union (and that David Geffen is his deputy), well, remember where you read it first.

28,"Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps ""broadly"" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "","" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: ""How's this for a fast start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative."" Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of ""topsy-turvydom""--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit London, theater attendance is down, and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic ""soufflés."" Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends: ""How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."" 

         The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea (""spinach water""). When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988). The Mikado is a triumph--it would be the Savoy's biggest hit--but there's no transformation in the lives of its makers. Gilbert can't bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife (Lesley Manville), and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, Leonora, is drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature--a Nature that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of Art: Leonora on stage singing Yum-Yum's sublime ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze …"" As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made. Topsy-Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless. 

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

28,"Grand Finale 

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps ""broadly"" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "","" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: ""How's this for a fast start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative."" Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of ""topsy-turvydom""--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit London, theater attendance is down, and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic ""soufflés."" Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends: ""How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."" 

         The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea (""spinach water""). When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988). The Mikado is a triumph--it would be the Savoy's biggest hit--but there's no transformation in the lives of its makers. Gilbert can't bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife (Lesley Manville), and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, Leonora, is drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature--a Nature that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of Art: Leonora on stage singing Yum-Yum's sublime ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze …"" As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made. Topsy-Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless. 

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera.

30,"I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist. And, as it also turned out, he didn't really feel bad for saying what he said. In fact, he was more convinced than ever that the Antichrist is a Jew who walks among us. 

         Let me pause for a moment to give three concise reasons why I'm so curious about the identity of the Antichrist: 

         1) I think I speak for all the approximately 4.5 million adult male Jews in the world when I say that we get a little antsy when Christians start looking at us like we're the devil. This is on account of Christian behavior over the past 2,000 years, by which I mean blood libels and pogroms and inquisitions, those sorts of things. 

         2) I've always been possessed by the delusional notion that I am to play a major role in world history, so why not a role in the End of Days? And I don't mean the Schwarzenegger movie. 

         3) Now that we stand on the lip of the millennium, much of the evangelical Christian world is in the grip of Armageddon fever, and, according to the evangelical interpretation of the books of Daniel and Revelation, the Antichrist will make his appearance before Christ makes his, and his is looking kinda imminent. The Antichrist, in this reading, will be a world leader who strikes a peace deal with Israel, only to betray the Jewish state and make war on it, until Jesus comes to the rescue. The thankful Jews, those who are still alive, will then become Christians and live happily ever after. These beliefs, held by tens of millions of Christians are, journalistically speaking, worthy of note. 

         The day before my visit with the Rev. Falwell, I had just finished reading a novelistic treatment of these events, Assassins , which is subtitled Assignment: Jerusalem, Target: Antichrist . Assassins is the sixth book in the ""Left Behind"" series, ""left behind"" referring to those unfortunate nonevangelical Christians who are not taken up to heaven in the Rapture--the opening act in God's end days plan--and are forced to contend with the Antichrist's evil reign on Earth. The ""Left Behind"" series, co-written by Tim LaHaye, the prominent right-wing screwball and husband of Beverly LaHaye, the even more prominent right-wing screwball, and Jerry B. Jenkins, who, his biography states, is the author of 130 books, which is a lot of books for one guy to write, is a phenomenon. Ten million copies of the series have sold already--hundreds in my local PriceClub alone. ""Left Behind"" is the Harry Potter of the Armageddon set. 

         The notable thing for me about the ""Left Behind"" series--beside the fact that few in the secular media have noticed that millions of Americans are busy reading books warning about the imminence of one-world government, mass death, and the return of the Messiah, is that all the Jewish characters are Christian. LaHaye and Jenkins are both active participants in the absurd and feverish campaign by some evangelical Christians to redefine Judaism in a way that allows for belief in Jesus. 

         Jews (and again, I feel comfortable speaking for all of us here) find this sort of Christian imperialism just a wee bit offensive. Just imagine if Jews began an official campaign calling Muhammad irrelevant to Islam--can you imagine the fatwas that would produce? 

         But evangelical leaders, who are, in my experience, uniformly kind and generous in their personal relations, can also be terribly obnoxious in their relations with Jews. 

         There is only one road to salvation for Jews, and that road runs through Jesus, LaHaye told me. To his credit, though, LaHaye doesn't believe that the Antichrist will be Jewish. He will be a European gentile, who will kill lots of Jews. ""The Jews will be forced to accept the idolatry of the Antichrist or be beheaded,"" he said. This will take place during the seven-year Tribulation. 

         Jewish suffering, though, is divinely ordained. Even though the Antichrist will not be Jewish, Jews are still capable of great evil and have often been punished for their evil, LaHaye explained. ""Some of the greatest evil in the history of the world was concocted in the Jewish mind,"" LaHaye told me, for reasons that aren't entirely clear--he knew what the name ""Goldberg"" generally signifies. ""Sigmund Freud, Marx, these were Jewish minds that were infected with atheism."" 

         I asked LaHaye to tell me more about the Jewish mind. 

         ""The Jewish brain also has the capacity for great good,"" he explained. ""God gave the Jews great intelligence. He didn't give them great size or physical power--you don't see too many Jews in the NFL--but he gave them great minds."" 

         Of all the evangelical leaders I have interviewed, LaHaye is capable of some of the most anti-Semitic utterances, which is troublesome, because he is also the most popular author in the evangelical world. 

         The Rev. Falwell is smoother than LaHaye. He acknowledges ""where the sensitivity comes from,"" though he shows no understanding of the role the myth of the Antichrist played in the history of anti-Semitism, and he refuses to back away from his opinion that somewhere in Great Neck or West L.A. or Shaker Heights is living Satan's agent. 

         ""In my opinion,"" he told me, ""the Antichrist will be a counterfeit of the true Christ, which means that he will be male and Jewish, since Jesus was male and Jewish."" 

         I asked him if he understood that such statements strip Jews of their humanity, which is the first step anti-Semites take before they kill them. He responded, ""All the Jewish people we do business with on a daily basis, not one has ever got upset over this."" It is not Jews who picked this most recent fight, he said, it is supporters of President Clinton. 

         ""Billy Graham made the same statement a dozen times last year, but there was no comment about that,"" Falwell said. ""But Billy Graham was not calling for the resignation of the president."" Falwell, you'll recall, is no fan of Clinton's; he has even peddled a video accusing the president of murder. 

         Falwell is right: Evangelical preachers are constantly accusing the Jews of harboring the Antichrist. 

         I asked Falwell if he knew the actual identity of the Antichrist. No, he said. ""People might say, it's a certain person, it's Henry Kissinger, like that, but the Lord does not let us know that."" 

         So there's a chance, then, that I'm the Antichrist? 

         Falwell chuckled a condescending chuckle. ""It's almost amusing, that question. Of course not. I know that you're not."" 

         Why? 

         ""The Antichrist will be a world leader, he'll have supernatural powers,"" he said. 

         He got me there--I have no supernatural powers. I can't even drive a stick shift. 

         I pressed him further on the identity of the Antichrist, but Falwell wouldn't play. ""We'll know the Antichrist when he arrives,"" he said. 

         Most evangelical leaders, in fact, refuse to publicly guess the name of the Antichrist--though, as Falwell suggests, Kissinger is a perennial favorite, at least among those evangelicals who believe the Antichrist will be Jewish. For most of their history, Christian leaders had been content to ascribe the characteristics of the Antichrist to the Jewish people as a whole. ""Ever since the 2 nd century CE, the very beginning of the Antichrist legend, Christians have associated Jews with everything unholy,"" Andrew Gow, who teaches Christian history at the University of Alberta, told me. In the minds of early Christian leaders, the church was the new Israel; God's covenant with the Jews was obsolete. Therefore, the Jews who remained on Earth were there to serve devilish purposes, Gow explained. 

         There are plenty of evangelical thinkers who differ with Falwell, who believe, like LaHaye, that the Antichrist will be a gentile who rises out of Europe. ""The Antichrist is supposed to make a peace treaty with Israel,"" Ed Hindson, the author of Is the Antichrist Alive and Well? , explained. ""Why would a Jew make a peace treaty with a Jewish state?"" 

         Hindson suggested that Satan will make the Antichrist the leader of the European Union--the revived Roman Empire, eternal enemy of Israel--though Hindson disputed one popular idea advocated by Monte Judah, an Oklahoma-based prophecy-teacher, that Prince Charles is the Antichrist. 

         ""There's no way Prince Charles is the Antichrist,"" Hindson said. ""Satan can do better than that."" 

         In his book, Hindson runs through a list of potential candidates. Bill Clinton is there, of course, as well as Saddam Hussein and Ronald Wilson Reagan (six letters in each of his three names. Get it?). 

         Of course, none of these men are gay. 

         ""It says in the Bible that the Antichrist will have 'no regard for women,' and so many evangelicals interpret that to mean that he will be a homosexual,"" Hindson said, though he added that he's not entirely convinced. 

         This idea--the Antichrist as gay--strikes a chord with many evangelicals, just as the idea that the Antichrist is Jewish strikes a chord. 

         I gradually came to see how far-fetched it was to think that I might be the Antichrist. I'm not gay, I'm not famous, I wouldn't know a euro if I found one in my wallet. 

         Then it struck me: Barry Diller is the Antichrist. 

         There's no way to know for sure. But if you wake up one morning to read that Barry Diller is the head of the European Union (and that David Geffen is his deputy), well, remember where you read it first.

He responded, ""All the Jewish people we do business with on a daily basis, not one has ever got upset over this."" It is not Jews who picked this most recent fight, he said, it is supporters of President Clinton. 

         ""Billy Graham made the same statement a dozen times last year, but there was no comment about that,"" Falwell said. ""But Billy Graham was not calling for the resignation of the president."" Falwell, you'll recall, is no fan of Clinton's; he has even peddled a video accusing the president of murder. 

         Falwell is right: Evangelical preachers are constantly accusing the Jews of harboring the Antichrist. 

         I asked Falwell if he knew the actual identity of the Antichrist. No, he said. ""People might say, it's a certain person, it's Henry Kissinger, like that, but the Lord does not let us know that."" 

         So there's a chance, then, that I'm the Antichrist? 

         Falwell chuckled a condescending chuckle. ""It's almost amusing, that question. Of course not. I know that you're not."" 

         Why? 

         ""The Antichrist will be a world leader, he'll have supernatural powers,"" he said. 

         He got me there--I have no supernatural powers. I can't even drive a stick shift. 

         I pressed him further on the identity of the Antichrist, but Falwell wouldn't play. ""We'll know the Antichrist when he arrives,"" he said. 

         Most evangelical leaders, in fact, refuse to publicly guess the name of the Antichrist--though, as Falwell suggests, Kissinger is a perennial favorite, at least among those evangelicals who believe the Antichrist will be Jewish. For most of their history, Christian leaders had been content to ascribe the characteristics of the Antichrist to the Jewish people as a whole. ""Ever since the 2 nd century CE, the very beginning of the Antichrist legend, Christians have associated Jews with everything unholy,"" Andrew Gow, who teaches Christian history at the University of Alberta, told me. In the minds of early Christian leaders, the church was the new Israel; God's covenant with the Jews was obsolete. Therefore, the Jews who remained on Earth were there to serve devilish purposes, Gow explained. 

         There are plenty of evangelical thinkers who differ with Falwell, who believe, like LaHaye, that the Antichrist will be a gentile who rises out of Europe. ""The Antichrist is supposed to make a peace treaty with Israel,"" Ed Hindson, the author of Is the Antichrist Alive and Well? , explained. ""Why would a Jew make a peace treaty with a Jewish state?"" 

         Hindson suggested that Satan will make the Antichrist the leader of the European Union--the revived Roman Empire, eternal enemy of Israel--though Hindson disputed one popular idea advocated by Monte Judah, an Oklahoma-based prophecy-teacher, that Prince Charles is the Antichrist. 

         ""There's no way Prince Charles is the Antichrist,"" Hindson said. ""Satan can do better than that."" 

         In his book, Hindson runs through a list of potential candidates. Bill Clinton is there, of course, as well as Saddam Hussein and Ronald Wilson Reagan (six letters in each of his three names. Get it?). 

         Of course, none of these men are gay. 

         ""It says in the Bible that the Antichrist will have 'no regard for women,' and so many evangelicals interpret that to mean that he will be a homosexual,"" Hindson said, though he added that he's not entirely convinced. 

         This idea--the Antichrist as gay--strikes a chord with many evangelicals, just as the idea that the Antichrist is Jewish strikes a chord. 

         I gradually came to see how far-fetched it was to think that I might be the Antichrist. I'm not gay, I'm not famous, I wouldn't know a euro if I found one in my wallet. 

         Then it struck me: Barry Diller is the Antichrist. 

         There's no way to know for sure. But if you wake up one morning to read that Barry Diller is the head of the European Union (and that David Geffen is his deputy), well, remember where you read it first.

30,"I, Antichrist? 

         Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That Antichrist. 

         I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda. And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the Antichrist. 

         The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive. These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he made earlier this year. 

         I was actually going to see the Rev. Falwell on a different matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it anyway. 

         As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the Antichrist. And, as it also turned out, he didn't really feel bad for saying what he said. In fact, he was more convinced than ever that the Antichrist is a Jew who walks among us. 

         Let me pause for a moment to give three concise reasons why I'm so curious about the identity of the Antichrist: 

         1) I think I speak for all the approximately 4.5 million adult male Jews in the world when I say that we get a little antsy when Christians start looking at us like we're the devil. This is on account of Christian behavior over the past 2,000 years, by which I mean blood libels and pogroms and inquisitions, those sorts of things. 

         2) I've always been possessed by the delusional notion that I am to play a major role in world history, so why not a role in the End of Days? And I don't mean the Schwarzenegger movie. 

         3) Now that we stand on the lip of the millennium, much of the evangelical Christian world is in the grip of Armageddon fever, and, according to the evangelical interpretation of the books of Daniel and Revelation, the Antichrist will make his appearance before Christ makes his, and his is looking kinda imminent. The Antichrist, in this reading, will be a world leader who strikes a peace deal with Israel, only to betray the Jewish state and make war on it, until Jesus comes to the rescue. The thankful Jews, those who are still alive, will then become Christians and live happily ever after. These beliefs, held by tens of millions of Christians are, journalistically speaking, worthy of note. 

         The day before my visit with the Rev. Falwell, I had just finished reading a novelistic treatment of these events, Assassins , which is subtitled Assignment: Jerusalem, Target: Antichrist . Assassins is the sixth book in the ""Left Behind"" series, ""left behind"" referring to those unfortunate nonevangelical Christians who are not taken up to heaven in the Rapture--the opening act in God's end days plan--and are forced to contend with the Antichrist's evil reign on Earth. The ""Left Behind"" series, co-written by Tim LaHaye, the prominent right-wing screwball and husband of Beverly LaHaye, the even more prominent right-wing screwball, and Jerry B. Jenkins, who, his biography states, is the author of 130 books, which is a lot of books for one guy to write, is a phenomenon. Ten million copies of the series have sold already--hundreds in my local PriceClub alone. ""Left Behind"" is the Harry Potter of the Armageddon set. 

         The notable thing for me about the ""Left Behind"" series--beside the fact that few in the secular media have noticed that millions of Americans are busy reading books warning about the imminence of one-world government, mass death, and the return of the Messiah, is that all the Jewish characters are Christian. LaHaye and Jenkins are both active participants in the absurd and feverish campaign by some evangelical Christians to redefine Judaism in a way that allows for belief in Jesus. 

         Jews (and again, I feel comfortable speaking for all of us here) find this sort of Christian imperialism just a wee bit offensive. Just imagine if Jews began an official campaign calling Muhammad irrelevant to Islam--can you imagine the fatwas that would produce? 

         But evangelical leaders, who are, in my experience, uniformly kind and generous in their personal relations, can also be terribly obnoxious in their relations with Jews. 

         There is only one road to salvation for Jews, and that road runs through Jesus, LaHaye told me. To his credit, though, LaHaye doesn't believe that the Antichrist will be Jewish. He will be a European gentile, who will kill lots of Jews. ""The Jews will be forced to accept the idolatry of the Antichrist or be beheaded,"" he said. This will take place during the seven-year Tribulation. 

         Jewish suffering, though, is divinely ordained. Even though the Antichrist will not be Jewish, Jews are still capable of great evil and have often been punished for their evil, LaHaye explained. ""Some of the greatest evil in the history of the world was concocted in the Jewish mind,"" LaHaye told me, for reasons that aren't entirely clear--he knew what the name ""Goldberg"" generally signifies. ""Sigmund Freud, Marx, these were Jewish minds that were infected with atheism."" 

         I asked LaHaye to tell me more about the Jewish mind. 

         ""The Jewish brain also has the capacity for great good,"" he explained. ""God gave the Jews great intelligence. He didn't give them great size or physical power--you don't see too many Jews in the NFL--but he gave them great minds."" 

         Of all the evangelical leaders I have interviewed, LaHaye is capable of some of the most anti-Semitic utterances, which is troublesome, because he is also the most popular author in the evangelical world. 

         The Rev. Falwell is smoother than LaHaye. He acknowledges ""where the sensitivity comes from,"" though he shows no understanding of the role the myth of the Antichrist played in the history of anti-Semitism, and he refuses to back away from his opinion that somewhere in Great Neck or West L.A. or Shaker Heights is living Satan's agent. 

         ""In my opinion,"" he told me, ""the Antichrist will be a counterfeit of the true Christ, which means that he will be male and Jewish, since Jesus was male and Jewish."" 

         I asked him if he understood that such statements strip Jews of their humanity, which is the first step anti-Semites take before they kill them. He responded, ""All the Jewish people we do business with on a daily basis, not one has ever got upset over this.""

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, ""To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!""? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening ""crawl"" begins: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute."" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. 

         Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace , too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given Ed Wood $115 million to remake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like this, although Wood's dialogue would surely have been more memorable. 

         The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucas, who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a movie. Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars (1977) concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out, and overseeing productions that other people storyboard and stage, he has come to lack what one might Michelangelistically term ""the spark of life."" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up.

Yes, they're terrible, but Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are not terrible actors, they've just been given scenes that no human could be expected to play. As a sage Jedi Master called Qui-Gon Jinn, Neeson must maintain a Zen-like detachment from the universe around him--probably not a challenge when that universe will be added in later by computers. ""I don't sense anything,"" he tells his uneasy young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), as the two sit waiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray, fish-faced Federation officers who talk like extras in a samurai movie. McGregor furrows his brow. ""There's something ... elusive,"" he says, working to enunciate like a young Alec Guinness but succeeding only in nullifying his natural Scots charm.

         Say this for Lucas, he doesn't whip up a lot of bogus energy, the way the makers of such blockbusters as The Mummy (1999) and Armageddon (1998) do. It's as if he conceived The Phantom Menace as a Japanese No pageant and has purposely deadened his actors, directing them to stand stiffly in the dead center of the screen against matte paintings of space or some futuristic metropolis and deliver lines alternately formal or bemusing. (""This is an odd move for the Trade Federation."") Lucas considers himself an ""independent"" filmmaker and an artist of integrity. Had he not been such a pretentious overlord, a platoon of screenwriters would doubtless have been engaged to rewrite him and make the movie halfway human. A buddy specialist would have punched up the Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi badinage, and a black dialogue specialist would have given the comic-relief character, Jar Jar Binks, a man-size dinosaur with pop eyes and a vaguely West Indian patois, something fresher than ""Ex-squeeze me!"" and a lot of Butterfly McQueen-style simpering and running away from battles. Those of us who complain about the assembly-line production of ""blockbuster"" scripts need an occasional reminder that assembly lines can do much to make empty thrill machines more lively. 

                         The Phantom Menace didn't need to be barren of feeling, but it took a real writer, Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill , 1983), to draft the best and most inspiring of the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a real director, Irvin Kershner, to breathe Wagnerian grandeur into Lucas' cartoonish fantasies. Having lived with the saga for so many years, the audience was prepared to set aside some of its narrative expectations here to plumb the origins of Lucas' universe. In The Phantom Menace , however, the Jedi already exist and the Force is taken for granted--we're still in the middle of the damn story. The only dramatic interest comes from a young Tatooine slave named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom we know will grow up to father Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and then surrender to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader. But that transformation won't happen until the third episode; meanwhile, Anakin is a conventionally industrious juvenile with a penchant for building droids from scratch and ""pod racing""--an activity that he demonstrates in one of the movie's most impressive but irrelevant special effects set pieces, a whiplash hyperdrive permutation of the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959). 

         Later in the film, when Anakin goes before something called the Jedi Council and meets Yoda and Samuel L. Jackson (together again!), Lucas dramatizes the interrogation so ineptly that you either have to take Yoda's word that there's something wrong with the boy (""Clouded this boy's future is"") or to conclude that Yoda, like us, is moving backward through time and has already seen Episodes 4 through 6. Anakin, he says smugly, has fear in him, and fear leads to anger and anger to the dark side--which would mean, as I interpret it, that only people without fear (i.e., people who don't exist) are suitable candidates for Jedi knighthood (perhaps Yoda will enlarge his definition of fear in subsequent episodes). There's also some quasireligious, quasiscientific blather to the effect that the boy was conceived without a father by ""metachorians""--symbiont, microscopic life forms that will speak to you if you ""quiet your mind."" In other words, the Force. So, it's not nebulous, after all! It can be measured. It can be quantified. It can even, perhaps, be merchandised. 

         Yes, the effects are first-rate, occasionally breathtaking. But the floating platforms in the Galactic Senate do little to distract you from parliamentary machinations that play like an especially dull day on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine . The final military engagement, in which long-headed attack droids are rolled onto the field as the spokes of a giant wheel, would be awesome if Lucas didn't routinely cut away from the battle just when he seems on the verge of actually thrilling you. The chief villain, bombastically named Darth Maul, is a horned, red, Kabuki-style snake demon with orange pingpong-ball eyes who challenges the Jedi to a couple of clackety light-saber battles. His appearances are underscored by demonic chants; he might as well wear a neon beanie that flashes ""Bad Guy."" Like all revisionist historians, Lucas cheats like mad. If Darth Vader had built C-3PO as a young man, how come he never paid much attention to him in the other movies--and vice versa? As Yoda himself puts it, in another context, ""See through you we can.""

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, ""To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!""? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening ""crawl"" begins: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute."" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. 

         Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace , too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given Ed Wood $115 million to remake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like this, although Wood's dialogue would surely have been more memorable. 

         The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucas, who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a movie. Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars (1977) concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out, and overseeing productions that other people storyboard and stage, he has come to lack what one might Michelangelistically term ""the spark of life."" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up. 

         Advance word has been cruel to the actors, but advance word has it only half right. Yes, they're terrible, but Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are not terrible actors, they've just been given scenes that no human could be expected to play. As a sage Jedi Master called Qui-Gon Jinn, Neeson must maintain a Zen-like detachment from the universe around him--probably not a challenge when that universe will be added in later by computers. ""I don't sense anything,"" he tells his uneasy young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), as the two sit waiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray, fish-faced Federation officers who talk like extras in a samurai movie. McGregor furrows his brow. ""There's something ... elusive,"" he says, working to enunciate like a young Alec Guinness but succeeding only in nullifying his natural Scots charm.

         Those poor souls who've been camping out in front of theaters for six weeks: Who can blame them for saying, ""To hell with the critics, we know it will be great!""? The doors will open, and they'll race to grab the best seats and feel a surge of triumph as their butts sink down. We've made it: Yeeehaww!! They'll cheer when the familiar John Williams fanfare erupts and the title-- Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace --rises out of the screen and the backward-slanted opening ""crawl"" begins: ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away ..."" Yaaahhhhhhh!!! Then, their hearts pounding, they'll settle back to read the rest of the titles: ""Turmoil has engulfed the Galactic Republic. The taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute."" Taxation of trade routes: Waaahoooo!!!!              

         How long will they go with it? At what point will they realize that what they've heard is, alas, true, that the picture really is a stiff? Maybe they never will. Maybe they'll want to love The 

            Phantom Menace so much--because they have so much emotional energy invested in loving it, and in buying the books, magazines, dolls, cards, clothes, soap, fast food, etc.--that the realization will never sink in. In successful hypnosis, the subject works to enter a state of heightened susceptibility, to surrender to a higher power. Maybe they'll conclude that common sense is the enemy of the Force and fight it to the death. 

         Look, I wanted to love The Phantom Menace , too. I was an adolescent boy and would enjoy being one again for a couple of hours. But the movie has a way of deflating all but the most delusional of hopes. If someone had given Ed Wood $115 million to remake Plan Nine From Outer Space it might have looked like this, although Wood's dialogue would surely have been more memorable. 

         The first thing that will strike you is that George Lucas, who wrote and directed the movie, has forgotten how to write and direct a movie. Having spent the two decades since the original Star Wars (1977) concocting skeletons of screenplays that other people flesh out, and overseeing productions that other people storyboard and stage, he has come to lack what one might Michelangelistically term ""the spark of life."" If the first Star Wars was a box of Cracker Jacks that was all prizes, The Phantom Menace is a box of Cracker Jacks that's all diagrams of prizes. It's there on paper, but it's waiting to be filled in and jazzed up. 

         Advance word has been cruel to the actors, but advance word has it only half right. Yes, they're terrible, but Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Natalie Portman are not terrible actors, they've just been given scenes that no human could be expected to play. As a sage Jedi Master called Qui-Gon Jinn, Neeson must maintain a Zen-like detachment from the universe around him--probably not a challenge when that universe will be added in later by computers. ""I don't sense anything,"" he tells his uneasy young apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor), as the two sit waiting to conduct trade negotiations with a bunch of gray, fish-faced Federation officers who talk like extras in a samurai movie. McGregor furrows his brow. ""There's something ... elusive,"" he says, working to enunciate like a young Alec Guinness but succeeding only in nullifying his natural Scots charm. ""Master,"" he adds, ""you said I should be mindful of the future."" Neeson thinks a bit. ""I do sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute."" 

         A hologram of Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the ""Sith,"" commands the Federation to sic its battle droids on the Jedi ambassadors before they can apprise Queen Amidala (Portman) of the imminent invasion of the peaceful planet of Naboo. In come the battle droids and out come the light sabers, which still hum like faulty fluorescents. Clack, clack, clack. Lucas can't edit fight scenes so that they're fluid--he cuts on the clack. You get the gist, though. The Jedi make their getaway, but with gas and tolls and droid destroyers, it takes them over an hour to land on Naboo, by which time the queen and the Galactic Senate have already got the grim message. For one thing, communications have been disrupted: ""A communications disruption can mean only one thing,"" says someone. ""Invasion."" 

         Queen Amidala, done up like a white-faced Chinese empress in hanging beads and glass balls and a hat with curly horns, speaks in tones from which emotion has been expunged, perhaps on the theory that subjects won't argue with a ruler who puts them to sleep: ""I ... will ... not ... condone ... a ... course ... of ... action ... that ... will ... lead ... us ... to ... war,"" she drones. Meanwhile, the Jedi whiz through the underwater core of a planet in a man-of-warlike submersible pursued by 3-D dragony beasties and a giant catfish with extra movable parts. Potentially thrilling stuff, but Neeson and McGregor remain peculiarly unruffled. ""The Force will guide us,"" says Neeson blandly, and the director seems to share his lack of urgency. There's Zen detachment and there's Quaalude detachment, and The Phantom                 Menace falls into the second camp: It really does take place a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away. When R2-D2 showed up, I thought: At last, a character with the potential for intimacy!              

         Say this for Lucas, he doesn't whip up a lot of bogus energy, the way the makers of such blockbusters as The Mummy (1999) and Armageddon (1998) do. It's as if he conceived The Phantom Menace as a Japanese No pageant and has purposely deadened his actors, directing them to stand stiffly in the dead center of the screen against matte paintings of space or some futuristic metropolis and deliver lines alternately formal or bemusing. (""This is an odd move for the Trade Federation."") Lucas considers himself an ""independent"" filmmaker and an artist of integrity. Had he not been such a pretentious overlord, a platoon of screenwriters would doubtless have been engaged to rewrite him and make the movie halfway human. A buddy specialist would have punched up the Qui-Gon Jinn/Obi-Wan Kenobi badinage, and a black dialogue specialist would have given the comic-relief character, Jar Jar Binks, a man-size dinosaur with pop eyes and a vaguely West Indian patois, something fresher than ""Ex-squeeze me!"" and a lot of Butterfly McQueen-style simpering and running away from battles. Those of us who complain about the assembly-line production of ""blockbuster"" scripts need an occasional reminder that assembly lines can do much to make empty thrill machines more lively. 

                         The Phantom Menace didn't need to be barren of feeling, but it took a real writer, Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill , 1983), to draft the best and most inspiring of the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and a real director, Irvin Kershner, to breathe Wagnerian grandeur into Lucas' cartoonish fantasies. Having lived with the saga for so many years, the audience was prepared to set aside some of its narrative expectations here to plumb the origins of Lucas' universe. In The Phantom Menace , however, the Jedi already exist and the Force is taken for granted--we're still in the middle of the damn story. The only dramatic interest comes from a young Tatooine slave named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), whom we know will grow up to father Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and then surrender to the dark side of the Force and become Darth Vader. But that transformation won't happen until the third episode; meanwhile, Anakin is a conventionally industrious juvenile with a penchant for building droids from scratch and ""pod racing""--an activity that he demonstrates in one of the movie's most impressive but irrelevant special effects set pieces, a whiplash hyperdrive permutation of the chariot race in Ben-Hur (1959). 

         Later in the film, when Anakin goes before something called the Jedi Council and meets Yoda and Samuel L. Jackson (together again!), Lucas dramatizes the interrogation so ineptly that you either have to take Yoda's word that there's something wrong with the boy (""Clouded this boy's future is"") or to conclude that Yoda, like us, is moving backward through time and has already seen Episodes 4 through 6. Anakin, he says smugly, has fear in him, and fear leads to anger and anger to the dark side--which would mean, as I interpret it, that only people without fear (i.e., people who don't exist) are suitable candidates for Jedi knighthood (perhaps Yoda will enlarge his definition of fear in subsequent episodes). There's also some quasireligious, quasiscientific blather to the effect that the boy was conceived without a father by ""metachorians""--symbiont, microscopic life forms that will speak to you if you ""quiet your mind."" In other words, the Force. So, it's not nebulous, after all! It can be measured. It can be quantified. It can even, perhaps, be merchandised. 

         Yes, the effects are first-rate, occasionally breathtaking. But the floating platforms in the Galactic Senate do little to distract you from parliamentary machinations that play like an especially dull day on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine . The final military engagement, in which long-headed attack droids are rolled onto the field as the spokes of a giant wheel, would be awesome if Lucas didn't routinely cut away from the battle just when he seems on the verge of actually thrilling you. The chief villain, bombastically named Darth Maul, is a horned, red, Kabuki-style snake demon with orange pingpong-ball eyes who challenges the Jedi to a couple of clackety light-saber battles. His appearances are underscored by demonic chants; he might as well wear a neon beanie that flashes ""Bad Guy."" Like all revisionist historians, Lucas cheats like mad. If Darth Vader had built C-3PO as a young man, how come he never paid much attention to him in the other movies--and vice versa? As Yoda himself puts it, in another context, ""See through you we can."" 

          Still, it's worth reprinting a blistering e-mail sent to my wife by a relative, after she'd let him know that I hated The Phantom Menace : 

                         Surprise, Surprise. Star Wars was never reviewed well by critics. Sometimes a basic story that rests on great special effects and stupid dialogue can be very entertaining--it's called a cult movie, and no critic can have an effect on the obvious outcome that this is going to be the highest grossing movie ever. I myself stood in line for five hours and already have tickets to see it three times, and I know I'll enjoy it. Why? Because it plays on my childhood imagination. And I'm sure it's not as bad as Return of the Jedi , which was the weakest one--but I still liked it and saw it a dozen times. I get tired of being told I'm not going to like it because it doesn't adhere to certain basic critic criteria. I say bpthhhh (sticking my tongue out to review)--don't be sending me anything dissing my movie:):):)              

         I'll be curious to know whether he sees The Phantom Menace a dozen times, or even the three for which he has paid. (I could imagine seeing it three times only if they sold adrenaline shots at the concession stand.) Or maybe he'll come out of the movie and say: ""No, you didn't get it, Mr. Snot-Nosed-Criteria Critic Person. It's not supposed to be exciting. It's laying the foundation for the next chapter, when Anakin and Obi-Wan defeat the Mandalorian warriors in the Clone Wars and Anakin marries Queen Amidala. And listen, I'm getting in line even earlier for tickets to Episode 2 . The Force is with me, butt-head.""

         If you haven't visited a dentist in the past few years, first of all, that's gross. (Checkups are every six months, and don't pretend you forgot.) Second, be grateful that you have avoided the ""intra-oral camera."" As the dentist (or assistant) navigates this horrifying little gadget through the graveyard of your mouth, a color television magnifies the florid pustulance of your gums and the puke-yellow dinge of your smile. A harmless crevice in your silver-mercury amalgam filling looks like Hell's Canyon. The microcracks in your enamel look like a broken window. All this can be fixed, of course, with 10 grand of straightening, filling, sealing, and whitening. ""You will agree to anything the second they put that thing in your mouth,"" says one recent victim of the camera. ""You can't believe you are walking around with that, that, that ick in your mouth."" 

         The transformation of American dentistry from drill-and-fill to shoot-and-loot is an unlikely business success story of the '90s, a case study in how a profession can work itself out of a job and still prosper. Dentists, after all, are supposed to be extinct by now. While they happily (and profitably) scraped teeth and filled cavities during the '60s and '70s, fluoride was quietly choking off their revenue stream. The percentage of children with cavities fell by half and kept falling. People stopped going to the dentist, because they didn't need to. At the same time, the government funded dental-school construction, spilling new dentists into a saturated market. Many found themselves cleaning teeth for $10 an hour in mall clinics. In 1984, Forbes magazine forecast the end of the profession. Only a few lonely dentists would survive to fill the few remaining cavities, the last vestiges of a once-great civilization on Long Island. 

         Instead, the number of dentists has jumped 20 percent, and the average salary soared from $76,000 in 1987 to $124,000 in 1996. What happened? In part, the oversupply of dentists and the declining demand for fillings forced the profession to change. Dentists had to become nicer and visits less unpleasant. The Marathon Man has been replaced by Dr. Soothe. ""People figured out pretty darn quickly that if you were an ass, patients would not come to you,"" says Dr. William Hartel, a St. Louis dentist. Many dentists' offices let you don virtual reality glasses and watch movies on them. Others offer massage therapy and hot tubs. Does your dentist have a certificate of pain management on her wall? I bet she does. 

         The most important discovery dentists made was the endless vanity of aging baby boomers. ""We are dealing now with the boomers who are the runners and the joggers and the dieters, and they are very concerned with how they look,"" says American Dental Association President Dr. Timothy Rose. Since going to the dentist was no longer a necessary evil, dentists made it an unnecessary pleasure. They allied themselves with the self-improvement movement. ""You still go for the needs, for the cavity that has to get filled, but more and more people ... come here to feel better about themselves,"" says Dr. Stephen Friedman, a Maryland dentist. 

         People used to be happy if they made it to old age with enough choppers to chew. But boomers, lured by media images of the Great American Smile, expect more. According to an ADA poll, the percentage of people who are ""very satisfied"" with their teeth has dropped from 57 percent to 46 percent in the past decade. Dentists have learned to play on this vanity and anxiety, encouraging dental care that is medically unnecessary but attractive to patients. ""It's as if you went to a physician for a treatment for a disease and he said you needed a nose job,"" says Dr. John Dodes, author of Healthy Teeth: A User's Manual . 

         To flog $500 teeth whitenings and multi-thousand dollar adult orthodontic treatments, dentists run computer simulations of your whitened, straightened teeth. Tooth color is measured on a scale that starts at A1. ""My dentist showed me these disgusting color charts and told me, 'You're an A2 now, but by the time you want to get married you are going to be an A4. And no one wants to marry an A4,' "" says one woman who got her teeth bleached. Dentists also prod patients to replace perfectly functional gray-metal fillings with tooth-colored plastic ones and to dump their solid gold crowns for white porcelain. Other dentists sell the psychology of tooth appearance. One dentist specializing in porcelain caps advises that male bosses with small teeth seem ""weak."" 

         Some dentists dress up these cosmetic measures in medical scare talk. A friend of mine just quit a dentist who was pressuring him to whiten his teeth as a ""preventive measure."" (To prevent what? Yellow teeth?) Many dentists claim, without scientific evidence, that the mercury in amalgam fillings is dangerous. They urge patients to replace the excellent amalgam with plastic fillings at four times the price. 

         Dentists make a killing on bad breath--or ""halitosis,"" as they prefer to call it. Breath clinics have sprouted up all over the country and are heavily advertised on the Web. They terrify patients with a ""halimeter,"" a new gadget that measures a nasty smelling chemical called methyl mercaptan. Armed with the halimeter proof, the dentist then dangles expensive mouthwashes and tongue scrapers in front of the patient. Never mind that you can get the same results for free with careful brushing and basic tongue-scraping. The machine makes the sale. ""Now that there is this machine that can document your complaint and can put a number on it, it motivates a patient to actually do something about it. But the treatments available now are the same ones that have been available for 15 years,"" says Hartel. 

         Entrepreneurial dentists market this elective care with trained aggression. Dental management organizations often require their employees to recite a quasisales script guiding patients toward profitable cosmetics. Ads in the Journal of the American Dental Association and on the Web promote tapes and classes on marketing techniques. One person I know quit his dentist when he spied a pamphlet in the office instructing the dentist in how to get his patients to ""trade up"" to more expensive treatment. The ADA's annual conference is overflowing with seminars on topics such as ""how to move your patients to 'yes.' "" 

         The industry calls this technique ""treatment acceptance,"" a marvelous euphemism for parting you from your money. According to the ADA's journal, this year's ADA conference will include an all-day ""Treatment Acceptance"" seminar ""for the dental team that is fed up with patients accepting only what insurance covers or asking for alternative cheaper treatment plans. Involve the entire team in creating the strategies for patients to accept optimum care."" 

         This hard sell is critical in dentistry in a way that it isn't in other medicine because of the profession's brutal economics. Dental insurance covers only 44 percent of Americans (compared to more than 80 percent for health insurance), and provides skimpy coverage for those who do have it. As a result, patients pay most dental costs--about 60 percent of them--out of their own pockets. Dental care is just another way to spend discretionary income, competing with a vacation or a new car. Dentists have to make patients want adult orthodontics in a way physicians don't have to make patients want a quadruple bypass. 

         It's tempting to dismiss the whole industry as a scam, particularly when dentists keep coming up with new ailments such as bruxism (teeth grinding), periodontal disease, malocclusion (bad bite), and microcracks. But these ailments are real, and our awareness of them shows how far dentistry has come. A generation ago, dentists filled teeth and cast dentures because that's all they knew. Decay killed so many teeth that fancier problems seldom arose. Since then, researchers have studied bonding, implants, and periodontal disease. Dentists can now make crowns that last forever, bridges that stay anchored, dentures that behave almost like real teeth. A generation ago, implants were a joke. Today's implants, affixed to your jawbone by a titanium screw, can hold for the rest of your life. 

         Scientists have learned how bacteria can build up in gaps in the gum, cause infection, weaken the jawbone, and eventually murder teeth. New research links these periodontal bacteria to heart disease, diabetes, low birth-weight babies, and other nastiness you'd expect from bacteria running wild in the bloodstream. This is why your dentist hectors you to rubber-tip your gums, brush with a superconcentrated fluoride toothpaste, and wear a night guard to control your bruxing (which loosens teeth, opening pockets between teeth and gum, etc.). It's also why your dentist may bully you into gum surgery. It all seems unpleasant and slightly absurd--the night guard is ""an excellent form of birth control,"" as one wearer puts it--but the alternative is losing your teeth at 40, getting dentures, and gumming your food. Dentistry is a hassle now because it works. 

         ""If you think back a couple of generations, it was considered inevitable that people would lose their teeth when they reached midlife. Around 40 or 45, you would have your teeth taken out. Periodontal disease was not understood, and decay was rampant. But now teeth are resistant to decay and are lasting a lifetime. I have gone in 18 years from learning how to make dentures and thinking it is OK for people to lose teeth to being appalled if anyone loses teeth. It is a failure,"" says Dr. Judith Penski, my own fabulous D.C. dentist. 

         Which brings us to the irony of dentistry's comeback: Just as patients love the dental care they should suspect, they resent the care they should appreciate. Aesthetic dentistry is the most profitable segment of the business because it is an easy sell. Put a camera in your mouth and you'll want whiter teeth, too. It is much harder to convince someone to poke her gums every night with a piece of rubber, to sleep with a choking plastic tooth guard, and to undergo four surgeries to fix a gum flap, all for a benefit that is decades away. The very success of dentistry has raised expectations so high that patients now object to any inconvenience. Americans under 60 believe keeping all their teeth is an entitlement: Telling them they need gum surgery to preserve their teeth makes them angry, not grateful--even though those teeth would have been goners 20 years ago. 

         When I surveyed 100 friends and acquaintances about their dental complaints, few bitched about cosmetic dentistry that was foisted on them. They like their whiter, straighter teeth. No, they griped about the medically advisable treatments that their dentists prescribed, especially gum surgeries and mouth guards. Pity the poor dentist who abjures cosmetic dentistry but vigorously protects patients' teeth. Patients don't like periodontal treatment, so they suspect it's a rip-off. This could not be further from the truth. 

         ""Dentists are aware of providing what patients want,"" says Hartel. ""I had a woman come in with a terrible toothache. She needed a root canal, but she did not want it. But she did want her teeth bleached, and she paid cash for it."" 

         Such is the triumph of American dentists: If they can't sell you what you need, they'll sell you what you want.

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps ""broadly"" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "","" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: ""How's this for a fast start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative."" Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of ""topsy-turvydom""--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit London, theater attendance is down, and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic ""soufflés."" Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends: ""How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."" 

         The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea (""spinach water""). When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988). The Mikado is a triumph--it would be the Savoy's biggest hit--but there's no transformation in the lives of its makers. Gilbert can't bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife (Lesley Manville), and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, Leonora, is drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature--a Nature that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of Art: Leonora on stage singing Yum-Yum's sublime ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze …"" As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made. Topsy-Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless. 

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

         Mike Leigh's 

               Topsy-Turvy                 broadly recounts the creation of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera The Mikado at London's Savoy Theatre in 1885. Perhaps ""broadly"" is putting too fine a point on it. The first hour, in which Arthur Sullivan (Allan Corduner) attempts to sever his ties with W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and the owner of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte (Ron Cook), is a mess: The order of scenes feels arbitrary, and characters pop up and vanish with bewildering frequency. You might be tempted to vanish, too. (Friends of mine did.) Be patient. Leigh's movies, born of actors' improvisations and loosely shaped, always take a while to find their rhythm--and, frequently, their point. This one finds everything. By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. And to something more: the fundamental sadness of people who labor to make beautiful things--who soar--and then come down to a not-so-beautiful earth. 

         It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. As Elvis Mitchell pointed out in 

               Slate                's "","" Leigh's opening shot features an usher who moves along a row of the Savoy Theatre lifting and peering under every seat. That's every seat. You can almost hear Leigh cackling: ""How's this for a fast start?--you bourgeois slaves to narrative."" Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of ""topsy-turvydom""--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. A heat wave has hit London, theater attendance is down, and Sullivan is itching to go off and become the English Mendelssohn--to write operas and symphonies instead of comic ""soufflés."" Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. He must also love that those scenes are narrative dead ends: ""How's this for conflict?--you bourgeois slaves to melodrama."" 

         The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. Gilbert attends a popular exposition of Japanese culture at Knightsbridge and watches Kabuki routines and women in kimonos pouring green tea (""spinach water""). When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988).

When a Japanese sword he has purchased falls off his wall, he hefts it; mimes a fight while issuing strangled, samurailike cries; then has a brainstorm. We hear the horns of The Mikado overture, then Leigh cuts to the fully realized opening scene on stage at the Savoy: ""We are gentlemen of Japan …"" Just that chorus is enough to reanimate the audience--to make people sit up and grin. And Leigh's technique of leaping back and forth between the finished Mikado and painstaking scenes of rehearsal has magic in it: You're watching straw, then gold, then straw, then gold. And you see the connection. 

         A central section of the drama is missing. What exactly fired Sullivan up about doing The Mikado ? What was different about this collaboration? No answer. Topsy-Turvy turns into something other than the Gilbert and Sullivan story: a portrait of life in the theater. A group portrait. D'Oyly Carte becomes a quiet third protagonist, a humane businessman. He softly negotiates a salary increase with the company's lead comic (Martin Savage), a neurasthenic junkie. He gently seeks the assurance of a tipsy ingénue (the tremulous Shirley Henderson) that her ""little weakness"" will not re-emerge. In the dressing room, performers gossip and complain, drink and shoot themselves up with drugs. Leigh's ensemble casts strive to be ""microcosms"" of society, so issues of class are ever present. You see it in Sullivan's banter with the working-class musicians in the pit and in Gilbert's with the uppity actors (the movie's posturing middle class), whom he drills on pronunciation and poise. The chorus is presented as some sort of collective folk conscience when it lobbies Gilbert to restore the rashly cut solo (""A more humane Mikado never did in Japan exist"") of the sad, fat fellow (Timothy Spall) in the title role. 

         Who would have predicted that Leigh would make Gilbert and Sullivan into Mike Leigh characters? Gilbert could be a stand-in for Leigh himself--a haughty, ill-humored man with an obsession for tiny details and a glowering dedication to process. Gilbert haggles with his actors over small things that shouldn't resonate but which somehow add up. Leigh's small things add up, too. The joke of The Mikado is that its Japanese lords are thinly disguised English bureaucrats; the joke of Topsy-Turvy is that the opera's English performers seem culturally incapable of playing Japanese. They rehearse in long coats and top hats, and some of the women (and men!) express horror at appearing on stage without corsets. Behind the satire, however, is a reverence for Gilbert and Sullivan: The tempos are slower than modern audiences are used to, and the staging has been stripped of high-camp accretions. I saw a D'Oyly Carte production of The Mikado in the late '70s: It was played fast and to the groundlings and made me never want to see a G&amp;S opera again. Now I can't wait for the next production. 

         Only a lunatic would call Topsy-Turvy , with its lame first hour and host of loose ends, a masterpiece, but by the finale I was ready to have myself committed. The finale itself must have done it. Leigh's endings are often wondrous, and this one is up there with the rooftop scene in High Hopes (1988). The Mikado is a triumph--it would be the Savoy's biggest hit--but there's no transformation in the lives of its makers. Gilbert can't bring himself to reach out to his brokenhearted wife (Lesley Manville), and Sullivan has a melancholy inkling that he has reached his artistic peak. The ingénue, Leonora, is drinking again, toasting herself in the mirror and praising the loveliness of Nature--a Nature that will, of course, destroy her. The final image is of Art: Leonora on stage singing Yum-Yum's sublime ""The sun whose rays are all ablaze …"" As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made. Topsy-Turvy leaves you upside down and breathless. 

         Like Mike Leigh, Errol Morris rarely begins a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be. Sometimes he doesn't end a project with a clear idea of what he wants it to be, either. His newest documentary, 

               Mr. Death : The Rise and Fall of Fred D. Leuchter, Jr.                , kicks up all sorts of messy emotions that his coolly ironic technique can't begin to handle. 

         The director is in his weird element only in the first half-hour, in which he sits his subject down and gets out of his way. Leuchter, who looks a little like the archetypal movie dweeb Charles Martin Smith and has a heavy exurbs-of-Boston accent, explains how he became involved in redesigning problematic electric chairs. ""Excess current cooks the tissue,"" he says, barely suppressing a smirk at his own expertise. ""There've been occasions where a great amount of current has been applied, and the meat actually will come off the executee's bone like the meat coming off a cooked chicken."" Leuchter set about making capital punishment more ""humane."" He moves on to talking about his redesigns for lethal-injection systems, gas chambers, and even a gallows, while underneath, Caleb Sampson provides macabre funhouse music and wistful calliope waltzes. Morris' distance from his subject implies condescension--Leuchter looks like something in a jar. But that's OK, because the man is an interesting specimen. Is he a monster or a humanist committed to eliminating the ""deplawrable tawchaw"" of capital punishment? It could go either way. 

         M r. Death gets into deeper waters when it recounts the trial of Ernst Zundel in Canada for proclaiming that the Holocaust never happened. Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the ""alleged"" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Leuchter smuggled specimens of rock and concrete back to the United States, where chemical analysis revealed no cyanide gas. Furthermore, Leuchter can't figure out how the gas would even have been administered without killing the Nazis themselves--proof, he argues, that mass extermination at Auschwitz never took place. The subsequent ""Leuchter Report"" became the backbone of Zundel's defense (he lost anyway) and of the burgeoning revisionist movement led by David Irving. But if Leuchter became a hero to neo-Nazis, he also became a target of Jewish groups and a pariah even in the execution business. When Morris hooks up with him for the last time, he's in hiding from creditors. 

         Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? The film suggests the latter. It certainly produces no evidence of malice. Plenty of monstrous insensitivity and hubris, though. Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter ""a fffool "" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. ""If he had spent time in the archives,"" says van Pelt, ""he would have found evidence about ventilation systems, ways to introduce Zyclon B into these buildings--but of course I don't think he knows German so it wouldn't have helped very much."" The most devastating rebuttal is from the chemist in charge of the Auschwitz analysis, who explains that the gas wouldn't have penetrated more than 10 microns into the wall (a human hair is 100 microns thick), so by crushing the samples (standard procedure), he had effectively diluted the cyanide 100,000 times. Against all this, Morris shows footage of Leuchter chiseling at Auschwitz and even adds some of his own, along with slow-motion shots of hammers bashing rocks, walls, floors, etc. It's an obscenity. 

         After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object. The director's beautiful detachment suggests a kind of cowardice. His technique is based on standing back--maintaining a fixed distance--while his subjects hang themselves, and for a while that works stunningly. But at a certain point, isn't it only human to want to engage this man? You don't need to play Mike Wallace and demolish Leuchter on camera. You could just ask him what he makes of, say, van Pelt's assertion that the answer to the riddle of the gas chambers was all over the archives, or what he thought of the chemist's declaration that the test performed for cyanide was the wrong test. Morris can be heard asking one question only: ""Have you ever thought you might be wrong or that you made a mistake?""--sufficiently broad that Leuchter can casually affirm his own inanity. 

         My concern here isn't so much for Leuchter or even the Holocaust revisionists, who'll just think he was sandbagged. The problem is that when a documentary filmmaker seems too scared or cool or arty to violate his own immaculate aesthetic, he ends up weakening his case. He also provides no emotional release, which isn't a small matter when the subject is Holocaust denial. Morris was close enough to Leuchter to have gotten something more, to have gone a little deeper in search of a poison that does penetrate surfaces.

""Just
 suppose,"" said Morgan, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the restaurant
 table. ""Where would we go from here?""


 The man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring
 down at his plate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought.
 Rather ordinary, in fact. A plain face, nose a little too long,
 fingers a little too dainty, a suit that doesn't quite seem to fit,
 but all in all, a perfectly ordinary looking man.


 Maybe
too
ordinary, Morgan thought.


 Finally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a
 hunted look in their depths that chilled Morgan a little. ""Where
 do we go? I don't know. I've tried to think it out, and I get
 nowhere. But you've
got
to believe me, Morgan. I'm lost,
 I mean it. If I can't get help, I don't know where it's going to
 end.""


 ""I'll tell you where it's going to end,"" said Morgan. ""It's
 going to end in a hospital. A mental hospital. They'll lock you
 up and they'll lose the key somewhere."" He poured himself
 another cup of coffee and sipped it, scalding hot. ""And that,""
 he added, ""will be that.""
The place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary
 fan swished patiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand
 through his dark hair. ""There must be some other way,"" he
 said. ""There has to be.""


 ""All right, let's start from the beginning again,"" Morgan
 said. ""Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You
 say your name is Parks—right?""


 The man nodded. ""Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps
 any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.""


 ""All right. And you got into town on Friday—right?""


 Parks nodded.


 ""Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened
 first?""


 The man thought for a minute. ""As I said, first there was
 a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was
 shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going
 to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway
 and tried to flag down a ride.""


 ""How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that
 you noticed?""


 ""
Strange!
"" Parks' eyes widened. ""I—I was speechless. At
 first I hadn't noticed too much—I was concerned with the fall,
 and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much
 else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars
 coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was
 crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the
 city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.""


 Morgan's mouth took a grim line. ""You understood the
 language?""


 ""Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked
 all the way into New York—nothing very important, but we
 understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but—""


 Morgan nodded. ""I know, I noticed. What did you do when
 you got to New York?""


 ""Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There
 had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd
 taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the
 man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.
 Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he
 sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.
 So I found a place—""


 ""Let me see the coins.""


 Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were
 perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a
 thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.
 Morgan looked up at the man sharply. ""What did you get for
 these?""


 Parks shrugged. ""Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the
 small one, five for the larger.""


 ""You should have gone to a bank.""


 ""I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that
 with everything else so similar, principles of business would
 also be similar.""


 Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. ""Well, then
 what?""


 Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,
 Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup
 to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down
 the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.
 ""First, I went to the mayor's office,"" he said. ""I kept trying to
 think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed
 a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went
 there.""


 ""But you didn't get to see him.""


 ""No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,
 and that I would have to have an appointment. She let
 me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.""


 ""And you told him?""


 ""No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was
 the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until
 another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor
 wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first."" He drew in
 a deep breath. ""So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly
 ushered back into the street again.""


 ""They didn't believe you,"" said Morgan.


 ""Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.""


 Morgan nodded. ""I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what
 did you do next?""


 ""Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,
 only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They
 muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and
 when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was—what
 did they call it?—a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come
 back with any more wild stories.""


 ""I see,"" said Morgan.


 Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the
 plate away. ""By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been
 prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.
 I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't
 that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.
 Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to
 them. I began to look for things that were
different
, things that
 I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling
 the truth, look at it—"" He looked up helplessly.


 ""And what did you find?""


 ""Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your
 calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your
 frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we
 don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.""
 The man gave a short laugh. ""And your house dogs!
 We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.
 But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely
 nothing.""


 ""Except yourself,"" Morgan said.


 ""Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,
 obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just
 looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,
 fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still
 couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.""


 Morgan's eyebrows lifted. ""Good,"" he said.


 Parks shrugged tiredly. ""Not really. He examined me. He
 practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying
 anything about who I was or where I came from; just said
 I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go
 to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me
 on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry
 about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human
 being as I've ever seen.' And that was that."" Parks laughed
 bitterly. ""I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,
 and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it
 defied reason, it was infuriating.""


 Morgan nodded sourly. ""Because you're not a human
 being,"" he said.


 ""That's right. I'm not a human being at all.""
""How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?""
 Morgan asked curiously. ""There must have been a million
 others to choose from.""


 Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin
 unhappily. ""I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.
 Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket
 you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you
 pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.
 The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned
 scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until
 it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When
 it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it
 and send through a manned scout."" He grinned sourly. ""Like
 me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they
 leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until
 we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the
 directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an
 infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting
 from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of
 space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.""


 He shook his head wearily. ""We're new at it, Morgan. We've
 only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in
 technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for
 over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much
 good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it
 looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner
 picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then
 something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried
 to make contact again, the scanner was gone!""


 ""And you found things here the same as back home,"" said
 Morgan.


 ""The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.
 Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are
 the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the
 same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.
 Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on
 the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent
 life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to
 tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,
they
 won't believe me
!""


 ""Why should they?"" asked Morgan. ""You look like a human
 being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.
 What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.""


 ""
But it's true.
""


 Morgan shrugged. ""So it's true. I won't argue with you. But
 as I asked before, even if I
did
believe you, what do you
 expect
me
to do about it? Why pick
me
, of all the people you've
 seen?""


 There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. ""I was tired, tired
 of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as
 though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.
 You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then
 I found out you wrote stories."" He looked up eagerly. ""I've
 got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.
 And think what it would mean to both of our worlds—contact
 with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,
 our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!""


 He leaned forward, his thin face intense. ""I need money and
 I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,
 know some of the design, some of the power and wiring
 principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.
 They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.
 But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government
 won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.""


 ""Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their
 hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and
 rockets to the moon to sink their money into."" Morgan stared
 at the man. ""But what can
I
do?""


 ""You can
write
! That's what you can do. You can tell the
 world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I
 know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must
 be the same in yours.""


 Morgan didn't move. He just stared. ""How many people
 have you talked to?"" he asked.


 ""A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.""


 ""And how many believed you?""


 ""None.""


 ""You mean
nobody
would believe you?""


 ""
Not one soul.
Until I talked to you.""


 And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears
 rolling down his cheeks. ""And I'm the one man who couldn't
 help you if my life depended on it,"" he gasped.


 ""You believe me?""


 Morgan nodded sadly. ""I believe you. Yes. I think your
 warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own
 planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.""


 ""Then you
can
help me.""


 ""I'm afraid not.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""Because I'd be worse than no help at all.""


 Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white.
 ""Why?"" he cried hoarsely. ""If you believe me, why can't you
 help me?""


 Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. ""I write,
 yes,"" he said sadly. ""Ever read stories like this before?""


 Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover.
 ""I barely looked at it.""


 ""You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue.
 The readers thought it was very interesting,"" Morgan grinned.
 ""Go ahead, look at it.""


 The stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine,
 stopped at a page that carried Roger Morgan's name. His eyes
 caught the first paragraph and he turned white. He set the
 magazine down with a trembling hand. ""I see,"" he said, and
 the life was gone out of his voice. He spread the pages viciously,
 read the lines again.


 The paragraph said:


 ""Just suppose,"" said Martin, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the table.

 obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just
 looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,
 fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still
 couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.""


 Morgan's eyebrows lifted. ""Good,"" he said.


 Parks shrugged tiredly. ""Not really. He examined me. He
 practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying
 anything about who I was or where I came from; just said
 I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go
 to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me
 on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry
 about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human
 being as I've ever seen.' And that was that."" Parks laughed
 bitterly. ""I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,
 and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it
 defied reason, it was infuriating.""


 Morgan nodded sourly. ""Because you're not a human
 being,"" he said.


 ""That's right. I'm not a human being at all.""
""How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?""
 Morgan asked curiously. ""There must have been a million
 others to choose from.""


 Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin
 unhappily. ""I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.
 Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket
 you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you
 pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.
 The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned
 scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until
 it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When
 it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it
 and send through a manned scout."" He grinned sourly. ""Like
 me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they
 leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until
 we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the
 directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an
 infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting
 from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of
 space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.""


 He shook his head wearily. ""We're new at it, Morgan. We've
 only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in
 technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for
 over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much
 good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it
 looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner
 picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then
 something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried
 to make contact again, the scanner was gone!""


 ""And you found things here the same as back home,"" said
 Morgan.


 ""The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.
 Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are
 the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the
 same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.
 Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on
 the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent
 life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to
 tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,
they
 won't believe me
!""


 ""Why should they?"" asked Morgan. ""You look like a human
 being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.
 What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.""


 ""
But it's true.
""


 Morgan shrugged. ""So it's true. I won't argue with you. But
 as I asked before, even if I
did
believe you, what do you
 expect
me
to do about it? Why pick
me
, of all the people you've
 seen?""


 There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. ""I was tired, tired
 of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as
 though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.
 You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then
 I found out you wrote stories."" He looked up eagerly. ""I've
 got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.
 And think what it would mean to both of our worlds—contact
 with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,
 our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!""


 He leaned forward, his thin face intense. ""I need money and
 I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,
 know some of the design, some of the power and wiring
 principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.
 They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.
 But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government
 won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.""


 ""Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their
 hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and
 rockets to the moon to sink their money into."" Morgan stared
 at the man. ""But what can
I
do?""


 ""You can
write
! That's what you can do. You can tell the
 world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I
 know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must
 be the same in yours.""


 Morgan didn't move. He just stared. ""How many people
 have you talked to?"" he asked.


 ""A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.""


 ""And how many believed you?""


 ""None.""


 ""You mean
nobody
would believe you?""


 ""
Not one soul.
Until I talked to you.""


 And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears
 rolling down his cheeks. ""And I'm the one man who couldn't
 help you if my life depended on it,"" he gasped.


 ""You believe me?""


 Morgan nodded sadly. ""I believe you. Yes. I think your
 warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own
 planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.""


 ""Then you
can
help me.""


 ""I'm afraid not.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""Because I'd be worse than no help at all.""


 Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white.
 ""Why?"" he cried hoarsely. ""If you believe me, why can't you
 help me?""


 Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. ""I write,
 yes,"" he said sadly. ""Ever read stories like this before?""


 Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover.
 ""I barely looked at it.""


 ""You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue.
 The readers thought it was very interesting,"" Morgan grinned.
 ""Go ahead, look at it.""


 The stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine,
 stopped at a page that carried Roger Morgan's name. His eyes
 caught the first paragraph and he turned white. He set the
 magazine down with a trembling hand. ""I see,"" he said, and
 the life was gone out of his voice. He spread the pages viciously,
 read the lines again.


 The paragraph said:


 ""Just suppose,"" said Martin, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the table.

""Just
 suppose,"" said Morgan, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the restaurant
 table. ""Where would we go from here?""


 The man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring
 down at his plate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought.
 Rather ordinary, in fact. A plain face, nose a little too long,
 fingers a little too dainty, a suit that doesn't quite seem to fit,
 but all in all, a perfectly ordinary looking man.


 Maybe
too
ordinary, Morgan thought.


 Finally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a
 hunted look in their depths that chilled Morgan a little. ""Where
 do we go? I don't know. I've tried to think it out, and I get
 nowhere. But you've
got
to believe me, Morgan. I'm lost,
 I mean it. If I can't get help, I don't know where it's going to
 end.""


 ""I'll tell you where it's going to end,"" said Morgan. ""It's
 going to end in a hospital. A mental hospital. They'll lock you
 up and they'll lose the key somewhere."" He poured himself
 another cup of coffee and sipped it, scalding hot. ""And that,""
 he added, ""will be that.""
The place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary
 fan swished patiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand
 through his dark hair. ""There must be some other way,"" he
 said. ""There has to be.""


 ""All right, let's start from the beginning again,"" Morgan
 said. ""Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You
 say your name is Parks—right?""


 The man nodded. ""Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps
 any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.""


 ""All right. And you got into town on Friday—right?""


 Parks nodded.


 ""Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened
 first?""


 The man thought for a minute. ""As I said, first there was
 a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was
 shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going
 to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway
 and tried to flag down a ride.""


 ""How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that
 you noticed?""


 ""
Strange!
"" Parks' eyes widened. ""I—I was speechless. At
 first I hadn't noticed too much—I was concerned with the fall,
 and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much
 else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars
 coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was
 crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the
 city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.""


 Morgan's mouth took a grim line. ""You understood the
 language?""


 ""Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked
 all the way into New York—nothing very important, but we
 understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but—""


 Morgan nodded. ""I know, I noticed. What did you do when
 you got to New York?""


 ""Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There
 had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd
 taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the
 man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.
 Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he
 sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.
 So I found a place—""


 ""Let me see the coins.""


 Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were
 perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a
 thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.
 Morgan looked up at the man sharply. ""What did you get for
 these?""


 Parks shrugged. ""Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the
 small one, five for the larger.""


 ""You should have gone to a bank.""


 ""I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that
 with everything else so similar, principles of business would
 also be similar.""


 Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. ""Well, then
 what?""


 Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,
 Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup
 to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down
 the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.
 ""First, I went to the mayor's office,"" he said. ""I kept trying to
 think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed
 a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went
 there.""


 ""But you didn't get to see him.""


 ""No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,
 and that I would have to have an appointment. She let
 me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.""


 ""And you told him?""


 ""No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was
 the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until
 another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor
 wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first."" He drew in
 a deep breath. ""So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly
 ushered back into the street again.""


 ""They didn't believe you,"" said Morgan.


 ""Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.""


 Morgan nodded. ""I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what
 did you do next?""


 ""Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,
 only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They
 muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and
 when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was—what
 did they call it?—a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come
 back with any more wild stories.""


 ""I see,"" said Morgan.


 Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the
 plate away. ""By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been
 prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.
 I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't
 that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.
 Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to
 them. I began to look for things that were
different
, things that
 I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling
 the truth, look at it—"" He looked up helplessly.


 ""And what did you find?""


 ""Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your
 calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your
 frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we
 don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.""
 The man gave a short laugh. ""And your house dogs!
 We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.
 But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely
 nothing.""


 ""Except yourself,"" Morgan said.


 ""Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,
 obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just
 looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,
 fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still
 couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.""

 beyond any question, a toy.

 Not a real, workable device.

 Except for the way it could work

 under a man's mental skin....
BY HARRY HARRISON
Because there were few adults in
 the crowd, and Colonel ""Biff"" Hawton
 stood over six feet tall, he could
 see every detail of the demonstration.
 The children—and most of the
 parents—gaped in wide-eyed wonder.
 Biff Hawton was too sophisticated
 to be awed. He stayed on because
 he wanted to find out what the
 trick was that made the gadget work.


 ""It's all explained right here in
 your instruction book,"" the demonstrator
 said, holding up a garishly
 printed booklet opened to a four-color
 diagram. ""You all know how
 magnets pick up things and I bet
 you even know that the earth itself is
 one great big magnet—that's why
 compasses always point north. Well
 ... the Atomic Wonder Space
 Wave Tapper hangs onto those space
 waves. Invisibly all about us, and
 even going right through us, are the
 magnetic waves of the earth. The
 Atomic Wonder rides these waves
 just the way a ship rides the waves
 in the ocean. Now watch....""


 Every eye was on him as he put the
 gaudy model rocketship on top of the
 table and stepped back. It was made
 of stamped metal and seemed as incapable
 of flying as a can of ham—which
 it very much resembled. Neither
 wings, propellors, nor jets broke
 through the painted surface. It rested
 on three rubber wheels and coming
 out through the bottom was a double
 strand of thin insulated wire. This
 white wire ran across the top of the
 black table and terminated in a control
 box in the demonstrator's hand.
 An indicator light, a switch and a
 knob appeared to be the only controls.


 ""I turn on the Power Switch, sending
 a surge of current to the Wave
 Receptors,"" he said. The switch
 clicked and the light blinked on and
 off with a steady pulse. Then the
 man began to slowly turn the knob.
 ""A careful touch on the Wave Generator
 is necessary as we are dealing
 with the powers of the whole world
 here....""


 A concerted
ahhhh
swept through
 the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper
 shivered a bit, then rose slowly into
 the air. The demonstrator stepped
 back and the toy rose higher and
 higher, bobbing gently on the invisible
 waves of magnetic force that
 supported it. Ever so slowly the power
 was reduced and it settled back to
 the table.


 ""Only $17.95,"" the young man
 said, putting a large price sign on the
 table. ""For the complete set of the
 Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper
 control box, battery and instruction
 book ...""


 At the appearance of the price
 card the crowd broke up noisily and
 the children rushed away towards the
 operating model trains. The demonstrator's
 words were lost in their
 noisy passage, and after a moment he
 sank into a gloomy silence. He put
 the control box down, yawned and
 sat on the edge of the table. Colonel
 Hawton was the only one left after
 the crowd had moved on.


 ""Could you tell me how this thing
 works?"" the colonel asked, coming
 forward. The demonstrator brightened
 up and picked up one of the
 toys.


 ""Well, if you will look here,
 sir...."" He opened the hinged top.
 ""You will see the Space Wave coils
 at each end of the ship."" With a pencil
 he pointed out the odd shaped
 plastic forms about an inch in diameter
 that had been wound—apparently
 at random—with a few turns of
 copper wire. Except for these coils
 the interior of the model was empty.
 The coils were wired together and
 other wires ran out through the hole
 in the bottom of the control box.
 Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
 eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
 who completely ignored this
 sign of disbelief.


 ""Inside the control box is the battery,""
 the young man said, snapping
 it open and pointing to an ordinary
 flashlight battery. ""The current goes
 through the Power Switch and Power
 Light to the Wave Generator ...""


 ""What you mean to say,"" Biff
 broke in, ""is that the juice from this
 fifteen cent battery goes through this
 cheap rheostat to those meaningless
 coils in the model and absolutely
 nothing happens. Now tell me what
 really flies the thing. If I'm going to
 drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
 worth of tin, I want to know what
 I'm getting.""


 The demonstrator flushed. ""I'm
 sorry, sir,"" he stammered. ""I wasn't
 trying to hide anything. Like any
 magic trick this one can't be really
 demonstrated until it has been purchased.""
 He leaned forward and whispered
 confidentially. ""I'll tell you
 what I'll do though. This thing is way
 overpriced and hasn't been moving at
 all. The manager said I could let them
 go at three dollars if I could find any
 takers. If you want to buy it for that
 price....""


 ""Sold, my boy!"" the colonel said,
 slamming three bills down on the
 table. ""I'll give that much for it no
 matter
how
it works. The boys in the
 shop will get a kick out of it,"" he
 tapped the winged rocket on his
 chest. ""Now
really
—what holds it
 up?""


 The demonstrator looked around
 carefully, then pointed. ""Strings!"" he
 said. ""Or rather a black thread. It
 runs from the top of the model,
 through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
 and back down to my hand—tied to
 this ring on my finger. When I back
 up—the model rises. It's as simple as
 that.""


 ""All good illusions are simple,""
 the colonel grunted, tracing the black
 thread with his eye. ""As long as
 there is plenty of flimflam to distract
 the viewer.""


 ""If you don't have a black table, a
 black cloth will do,"" the young man
 said. ""And the arch of a doorway is a
 good site, just see that the room in
 back is dark.""


 ""Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
 yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
 kind of thing.""
Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
 Thursday-night poker party. The
 gang were all missile men and they
 cheered and jeered as he hammed
 up the introduction.


 ""Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
 could use some of those magnetic
 waves in the new bird!""


 ""Those flashlight batteries are
 cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
 the future!""


 Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
 the flight began. He was an amateur
 magician and spotted the gimmick at
 once. He kept silent with professional
 courtesy, and smiled ironically as
 the rest of the bunch grew silent one
 by one. The colonel was a good showman
 and he had set the scene well.
 He almost had them believing in the
 Space Wave Tapper before he was
 through. When the model had landed
 and he had switched it off he couldn't
 stop them from crowding around
 the table.


 ""A thread!"" one of the engineers
 shouted, almost with relief, and they
 all laughed along with him.


 ""Too bad,"" the head project physicist
 said, ""I was hoping that a little
 Space Wave Tapping could help us
 out. Let me try a flight with it.""


 ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced.
 ""He spotted it while you
 were all watching the flashing lights,
 only he didn't say anything.""


 Kaner slipped the ring with the
 black thread over his finger and started
 to step back.


 ""You have to turn the switch on
 first,"" Biff said.


 ""I know,"" Kaner smiled. ""But
 that's part of illusion—the spiel and
 the misdirection. I'm going to try
 this cold first, so I can get it moving
 up and down smoothly, then go
 through it with the whole works.""

ILLUSTRATED BY BREY

 He moved his hand back smoothly,
 in a professional manner that drew
 no attention to it. The model lifted
 from the table—then crashed back
 down.


 ""The thread broke,"" Kaner said.


 ""You jerked it, instead of pulling
 smoothly,"" Biff said and knotted the
 broken thread. ""Here let me show
 you how to do it.""


 The thread broke again when Biff
 tried it, which got a good laugh that
 made his collar a little warm. Someone
 mentioned the poker game.


 This was the only time that poker
 was mentioned or even remembered
 that night. Because very soon after
 this they found that the thread would
 lift the model only when the switch
 was on and two and a half volts
 flowing through the joke coils. With
 the current turned off the model was
 too heavy to lift. The thread broke
 every time.
""I still think it's a screwy idea,""
 the young man said. ""One week getting

 those toy ships for every brat within
 a thousand miles. Then selling the
 things for three bucks when they
 must have cost at least a hundred dollars
 apiece to make.""


 ""But you
did
sell the ten of them
 to people who would be interested?""
 the older man asked.


 ""I think so, I caught a few Air
 Force officers and a colonel in missiles
 one day. Then there was one official
 I remembered from the Bureau
 of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize
 me. Then those two professors
 you spotted from the university.""


 ""Then the problem is out of our
 hands and into theirs. All we have to
 do now is sit back and wait for results.""


 ""
What
results?! These people
 weren't interested when we were
 hammering on their doors with the
 proof. We've patented the coils and
 can prove to anyone that there is a
 reduction in weight around them
 when they are operating....""


 ""But a small reduction. And we
 don't know what is causing it. No
 one can be interested in a thing like
 that—a fractional weight decrease in
 a clumsy model, certainly not enough
 to lift the weight of the generator.
 No one wrapped up in massive fuel
 consumption, tons of lift and such is
 going to have time to worry about a
 crackpot who thinks he has found a
 minor slip in Newton's laws.""


 ""You think they will now?"" the
 young man asked, cracking his knuckles
 impatiently.


 ""I
know
they will. The tensile
 strength of that thread is correctly adjusted
 to the weight of the model.
 The thread will break if you try to
 lift the model with it. Yet you can
 lift the model—after a small increment
 of its weight has been removed
 by the coils. This is going to bug
 these men. Nobody is going to ask
 them to solve the problem or concern
 themselves with it. But it will
 nag at them because they know this
 effect can't possibly exist. They'll see
 at once that the magnetic-wave theory
 is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We
 don't know. But they will all be
 thinking about it and worrying about
 it. Someone is going to experiment
 in his basement—just as a hobby of
 course—to find the cause of the error.

 work, or maybe a way to improve

 ""And we have the patents....""


 ""Correct. They will be doing the
 research that will take them out of
 the massive-lift-propulsion business

 ""And in doing so they will be making

BY HARRY HARRISON
Because there were few adults in
 the crowd, and Colonel ""Biff"" Hawton
 stood over six feet tall, he could
 see every detail of the demonstration.
 The children—and most of the
 parents—gaped in wide-eyed wonder.
 Biff Hawton was too sophisticated
 to be awed. He stayed on because
 he wanted to find out what the
 trick was that made the gadget work.


 ""It's all explained right here in
 your instruction book,"" the demonstrator
 said, holding up a garishly
 printed booklet opened to a four-color
 diagram. ""You all know how
 magnets pick up things and I bet
 you even know that the earth itself is
 one great big magnet—that's why
 compasses always point north. Well
 ... the Atomic Wonder Space
 Wave Tapper hangs onto those space
 waves. Invisibly all about us, and
 even going right through us, are the
 magnetic waves of the earth. The
 Atomic Wonder rides these waves
 just the way a ship rides the waves
 in the ocean. Now watch....""


 Every eye was on him as he put the
 gaudy model rocketship on top of the
 table and stepped back. It was made
 of stamped metal and seemed as incapable
 of flying as a can of ham—which
 it very much resembled. Neither
 wings, propellors, nor jets broke
 through the painted surface. It rested
 on three rubber wheels and coming
 out through the bottom was a double
 strand of thin insulated wire. This
 white wire ran across the top of the
 black table and terminated in a control
 box in the demonstrator's hand.
 An indicator light, a switch and a
 knob appeared to be the only controls.


 ""I turn on the Power Switch, sending
 a surge of current to the Wave
 Receptors,"" he said. The switch
 clicked and the light blinked on and
 off with a steady pulse. Then the
 man began to slowly turn the knob.
 ""A careful touch on the Wave Generator
 is necessary as we are dealing
 with the powers of the whole world
 here....""


 A concerted
ahhhh
swept through
 the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper
 shivered a bit, then rose slowly into
 the air. The demonstrator stepped
 back and the toy rose higher and
 higher, bobbing gently on the invisible
 waves of magnetic force that
 supported it. Ever so slowly the power
 was reduced and it settled back to
 the table.


 ""Only $17.95,"" the young man
 said, putting a large price sign on the
 table. ""For the complete set of the
 Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper
 control box, battery and instruction
 book ...""


 At the appearance of the price
 card the crowd broke up noisily and
 the children rushed away towards the
 operating model trains. The demonstrator's
 words were lost in their
 noisy passage, and after a moment he
 sank into a gloomy silence. He put
 the control box down, yawned and
 sat on the edge of the table. Colonel
 Hawton was the only one left after
 the crowd had moved on.


 ""Could you tell me how this thing
 works?"" the colonel asked, coming
 forward. The demonstrator brightened
 up and picked up one of the
 toys.


 ""Well, if you will look here,
 sir...."" He opened the hinged top.
 ""You will see the Space Wave coils
 at each end of the ship."" With a pencil
 he pointed out the odd shaped
 plastic forms about an inch in diameter
 that had been wound—apparently
 at random—with a few turns of
 copper wire. Except for these coils
 the interior of the model was empty.
 The coils were wired together and
 other wires ran out through the hole
 in the bottom of the control box.
 Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
 eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
 who completely ignored this
 sign of disbelief.


 ""Inside the control box is the battery,""
 the young man said, snapping
 it open and pointing to an ordinary
 flashlight battery. ""The current goes
 through the Power Switch and Power
 Light to the Wave Generator ...""


 ""What you mean to say,"" Biff
 broke in, ""is that the juice from this
 fifteen cent battery goes through this
 cheap rheostat to those meaningless
 coils in the model and absolutely
 nothing happens. Now tell me what
 really flies the thing. If I'm going to
 drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
 worth of tin, I want to know what
 I'm getting.""


 The demonstrator flushed. ""I'm
 sorry, sir,"" he stammered. ""I wasn't
 trying to hide anything. Like any
 magic trick this one can't be really
 demonstrated until it has been purchased.""
 He leaned forward and whispered
 confidentially. ""I'll tell you
 what I'll do though. This thing is way
 overpriced and hasn't been moving at
 all. The manager said I could let them
 go at three dollars if I could find any
 takers. If you want to buy it for that
 price....""


 ""Sold, my boy!"" the colonel said,
 slamming three bills down on the
 table. ""I'll give that much for it no
 matter
how
it works. The boys in the
 shop will get a kick out of it,"" he
 tapped the winged rocket on his
 chest. ""Now
really
—what holds it
 up?""


 The demonstrator looked around
 carefully, then pointed. ""Strings!"" he
 said. ""Or rather a black thread. It
 runs from the top of the model,
 through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
 and back down to my hand—tied to
 this ring on my finger. When I back
 up—the model rises. It's as simple as
 that.""


 ""All good illusions are simple,""
 the colonel grunted, tracing the black
 thread with his eye. ""As long as
 there is plenty of flimflam to distract
 the viewer.""


 ""If you don't have a black table, a
 black cloth will do,"" the young man
 said. ""And the arch of a doorway is a
 good site, just see that the room in
 back is dark.""


 ""Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
 yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
 kind of thing.""
Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
 Thursday-night poker party. The
 gang were all missile men and they
 cheered and jeered as he hammed
 up the introduction.


 ""Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
 could use some of those magnetic
 waves in the new bird!""


 ""Those flashlight batteries are
 cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
 the future!""


 Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
 the flight began. He was an amateur
 magician and spotted the gimmick at
 once. He kept silent with professional
 courtesy, and smiled ironically as
 the rest of the bunch grew silent one
 by one. The colonel was a good showman
 and he had set the scene well.
 He almost had them believing in the
 Space Wave Tapper before he was
 through. When the model had landed
 and he had switched it off he couldn't
 stop them from crowding around
 the table.


 ""A thread!"" one of the engineers
 shouted, almost with relief, and they
 all laughed along with him.


 ""Too bad,"" the head project physicist
 said, ""I was hoping that a little
 Space Wave Tapping could help us
 out. Let me try a flight with it.""


 ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced.
 ""He spotted it while you
 were all watching the flashing lights,
 only he didn't say anything.""


 Kaner slipped the ring with the
 black thread over his finger and started
 to step back.


 ""You have to turn the switch on
 first,"" Biff said.


 ""I know,"" Kaner smiled. ""But
 that's part of illusion—the spiel and
 the misdirection. I'm going to try
 this cold first, so I can get it moving
 up and down smoothly, then go
 through it with the whole works.""

ILLUSTRATED BY BREY

 He moved his hand back smoothly,
 in a professional manner that drew
 no attention to it. The model lifted
 from the table—then crashed back
 down.


 ""The thread broke,"" Kaner said.


 ""You jerked it, instead of pulling
 smoothly,"" Biff said and knotted the
 broken thread. ""Here let me show
 you how to do it.""


 The thread broke again when Biff
 tried it, which got a good laugh that
 made his collar a little warm. Someone
 mentioned the poker game.


 This was the only time that poker
 was mentioned or even remembered
 that night. Because very soon after
 this they found that the thread would
 lift the model only when the switch
 was on and two and a half volts
 flowing through the joke coils. With
 the current turned off the model was
 too heavy to lift. The thread broke
 every time.
""I still think it's a screwy idea,""
 the young man said. ""One week getting
 fallen arches, demonstrating
 those toy ships for every brat within
 a thousand miles. Then selling the
 things for three bucks when they
 must have cost at least a hundred dollars
 apiece to make.""


 ""But you

 ""But a small reduction. And we

 at random—with a few turns of
 copper wire. Except for these coils
 the interior of the model was empty.
 The coils were wired together and
 other wires ran out through the hole
 in the bottom of the control box.
 Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
 eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
 who completely ignored this
 sign of disbelief.


 ""Inside the control box is the battery,""
 the young man said, snapping
 it open and pointing to an ordinary
 flashlight battery. ""The current goes
 through the Power Switch and Power
 Light to the Wave Generator ...""


 ""What you mean to say,"" Biff
 broke in, ""is that the juice from this
 fifteen cent battery goes through this
 cheap rheostat to those meaningless
 coils in the model and absolutely
 nothing happens. Now tell me what
 really flies the thing. If I'm going to
 drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
 worth of tin, I want to know what
 I'm getting.""


 The demonstrator flushed. ""I'm
 sorry, sir,"" he stammered. ""I wasn't
 trying to hide anything. Like any
 magic trick this one can't be really
 demonstrated until it has been purchased.""
 He leaned forward and whispered
 confidentially. ""I'll tell you
 what I'll do though. This thing is way
 overpriced and hasn't been moving at
 all. The manager said I could let them
 go at three dollars if I could find any
 takers. If you want to buy it for that
 price....""


 ""Sold, my boy!"" the colonel said,
 slamming three bills down on the
 table. ""I'll give that much for it no
 matter
how
it works. The boys in the
 shop will get a kick out of it,"" he
 tapped the winged rocket on his
 chest. ""Now
really
—what holds it
 up?""


 The demonstrator looked around
 carefully, then pointed. ""Strings!"" he
 said. ""Or rather a black thread. It
 runs from the top of the model,
 through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
 and back down to my hand—tied to
 this ring on my finger. When I back
 up—the model rises. It's as simple as
 that.""


 ""All good illusions are simple,""
 the colonel grunted, tracing the black
 thread with his eye. ""As long as
 there is plenty of flimflam to distract
 the viewer.""


 ""If you don't have a black table, a
 black cloth will do,"" the young man
 said. ""And the arch of a doorway is a
 good site, just see that the room in
 back is dark.""


 ""Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
 yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
 kind of thing.""
Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
 Thursday-night poker party. The
 gang were all missile men and they
 cheered and jeered as he hammed
 up the introduction.


 ""Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
 could use some of those magnetic
 waves in the new bird!""


 ""Those flashlight batteries are
 cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
 the future!""


 Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
 the flight began. He was an amateur
 magician and spotted the gimmick at
 once. He kept silent with professional
 courtesy, and smiled ironically as
 the rest of the bunch grew silent one
 by one. The colonel was a good showman
 and he had set the scene well.
 He almost had them believing in the
 Space Wave Tapper before he was
 through. When the model had landed
 and he had switched it off he couldn't
 stop them from crowding around
 the table.


 ""A thread!"" one of the engineers
 shouted, almost with relief, and they
 all laughed along with him.


 ""Too bad,"" the head project physicist
 said, ""I was hoping that a little
 Space Wave Tapping could help us
 out. Let me try a flight with it.""


 ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced.
 ""He spotted it while you
 were all watching the flashing lights,
 only he didn't say anything.""


 Kaner slipped the ring with the
 black thread over his finger and started
 to step back.


 ""You have to turn the switch on
 first,"" Biff said.


 ""I know,"" Kaner smiled. ""But
 that's part of illusion—the spiel and
 the misdirection. I'm going to try
 this cold first, so I can get it moving
 up and down smoothly, then go
 through it with the whole works.""

ILLUSTRATED BY BREY

 He moved his hand back smoothly,
 in a professional manner that drew
 no attention to it. The model lifted
 from the table—then crashed back
 down.


 ""The thread broke,"" Kaner said.


 ""You jerked it, instead of pulling
 smoothly,"" Biff said and knotted the
 broken thread. ""Here let me show
 you how to do it.""


 The thread broke again when Biff
 tried it, which got a good laugh that
 made his collar a little warm. Someone
 mentioned the poker game.


 This was the only time that poker
 was mentioned or even remembered
 that night. Because very soon after
 this they found that the thread would
 lift the model only when the switch
 was on and two and a half volts
 flowing through the joke coils. With
 the current turned off the model was
 too heavy to lift. The thread broke
 every time.
""I still think it's a screwy idea,""
 the young man said. ""One week getting
 fallen arches, demonstrating
 those toy ships for every brat within
 a thousand miles. Then selling the
 things for three bucks when they
 must have cost at least a hundred dollars
 apiece to make.""


 ""But you
did
sell the ten of them
 to people who would be interested?""
 the older man asked.


 ""I think so, I caught a few Air
 Force officers and a colonel in missiles
 one day. Then there was one official
 I remembered from the Bureau
 of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize
 me. Then those two professors
 you spotted from the university.""


 ""Then the problem is out of our
 hands and into theirs. All we have to
 do now is sit back and wait for results.""


 ""
What
results?! These people
 weren't interested when we were
 hammering on their doors with the
 proof. We've patented the coils and
 can prove to anyone that there is a
 reduction in weight around them
 when they are operating....""


 ""But a small reduction. And we
 don't know what is causing it. No
 one can be interested in a thing like
 that—a fractional weight decrease in
 a clumsy model, certainly not enough
 to lift the weight of the generator.
 No one wrapped up in massive fuel
 consumption, tons of lift and such is
 going to have time to worry about a
 crackpot who thinks he has found a
 minor slip in Newton's laws.""


 ""You think they will now?"" the
 young man asked, cracking his knuckles
 impatiently.


 ""I
know
they will. The tensile
 strength of that thread is correctly adjusted
 to the weight of the model.
 The thread will break if you try to
 lift the model with it. Yet you can
 lift the model—after a small increment
 of its weight has been removed
 by the coils. This is going to bug
 these men. Nobody is going to ask
 them to solve the problem or concern
 themselves with it. But it will
 nag at them because they know this
 effect can't possibly exist. They'll see
 at once that the magnetic-wave theory
 is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We
 don't know. But they will all be
 thinking about it and worrying about
 it. Someone is going to experiment
 in his basement—just as a hobby of
 course—to find the cause of the error.
 And he or someone else is going
 to find out what makes those coils
 work, or maybe a way to improve
 them!""


 ""And we have the patents....""


 ""Correct. They will be doing the
 research that will take them out of
 the massive-lift-propulsion business
 and into the field of pure space
 flight.""


 ""And in doing so they will be making
 us rich—whenever the time
 comes to manufacture,"" the young
 man said cynically.


 ""We'll all be rich, son,"" the older
 man said, patting him on the shoulder.
 ""Believe me, you're not going to
 recognize this old world ten years
 from now.""

""Just
 suppose,"" said Morgan, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the restaurant
 table. ""Where would we go from here?""


 The man shifted uneasily in his seat. He was silent, staring
 down at his plate. Not a strange-looking man, Morgan thought.
 Rather ordinary, in fact. A plain face, nose a little too long,
 fingers a little too dainty, a suit that doesn't quite seem to fit,
 but all in all, a perfectly ordinary looking man.


 Maybe
too
ordinary, Morgan thought.


 Finally the man looked up. His eyes were dark, with a
 hunted look in their depths that chilled Morgan a little. ""Where
 do we go? I don't know. I've tried to think it out, and I get
 nowhere. But you've
got
to believe me, Morgan. I'm lost,
 I mean it. If I can't get help, I don't know where it's going to
 end.""


 ""I'll tell you where it's going to end,"" said Morgan. ""It's
 going to end in a hospital. A mental hospital. They'll lock you
 up and they'll lose the key somewhere."" He poured himself
 another cup of coffee and sipped it, scalding hot. ""And that,""
 he added, ""will be that.""
The place was dark and almost empty. Overhead, a rotary
 fan swished patiently. The man across from Morgan ran a hand
 through his dark hair. ""There must be some other way,"" he
 said. ""There has to be.""


 ""All right, let's start from the beginning again,"" Morgan
 said. ""Maybe we can pin something down a little better. You
 say your name is Parks—right?""


 The man nodded. ""Jefferson Haldeman Parks, if that helps
 any. Haldeman was my mother's maiden name.""


 ""All right. And you got into town on Friday—right?""


 Parks nodded.


 ""Fine. Now go through the whole story again. What happened
 first?""


 The man thought for a minute. ""As I said, first there was
 a fall. About twenty feet. I didn't break any bones, but I was
 shaken up and limping. The fall was near the highway going
 to the George Washington Bridge. I got over to the highway
 and tried to flag down a ride.""


 ""How did you feel? I mean, was there anything strange that
 you noticed?""


 ""
Strange!
"" Parks' eyes widened. ""I—I was speechless. At
 first I hadn't noticed too much—I was concerned with the fall,
 and whether I was hurt or not. I didn't really think about much
 else until I hobbled up to that highway and saw those cars
 coming. Then I could hardly believe my eyes. I thought I was
 crazy. But a car stopped and asked me if I was going into the
 city, and I knew I wasn't crazy.""


 Morgan's mouth took a grim line. ""You understood the
 language?""


 ""Oh, yes. I don't see how I could have, but I did. We talked
 all the way into New York—nothing very important, but we
 understood each other. His speech had an odd sound, but—""


 Morgan nodded. ""I know, I noticed. What did you do when
 you got to New York?""


 ""Well, obviously, I needed money. I had gold coin. There
 had been no way of knowing if it would be useful, but I'd
 taken it on chance. I tried to use it at a newsstand first, and the
 man wouldn't touch it. Asked me if I thought I was the U.S.
 Treasury or something. When he saw that I was serious, he
 sent me to a money lender, a hock shop, I think he called it.
 So I found a place—""


 ""Let me see the coins.""


 Parks dropped two small gold discs on the table. They were
 perfectly smooth and perfectly round, tapered by wear to a
 thin blunt edge. There was no design on them, and no printing.
 Morgan looked up at the man sharply. ""What did you get for
 these?""


 Parks shrugged. ""Too little, I suspect. Two dollars for the
 small one, five for the larger.""


 ""You should have gone to a bank.""


 ""I know that now. I didn't then. Naturally, I assumed that
 with everything else so similar, principles of business would
 also be similar.""


 Morgan sighed and leaned back in his chair. ""Well, then
 what?""


 Parks poured some more coffee. His face was very pale,
 Morgan thought, and his hands trembled as he raised the cup
 to his lips. Fright? Maybe. Hard to tell. The man put down
 the cup and rubbed his forehead with the back of his hand.
 ""First, I went to the mayor's office,"" he said. ""I kept trying to
 think what anyone at home would do in my place. That seemed
 a good bet. I asked a policeman where it was, and then I went
 there.""


 ""But you didn't get to see him.""


 ""No. I saw a secretary. She said the mayor was in conference,
 and that I would have to have an appointment. She let
 me speak to another man, one of the mayor's assistants.""


 ""And you told him?""


 ""No. I wanted to see the mayor himself. I thought that was
 the best thing to do. I waited for a couple of hours, until
 another assistant came along and told me flatly that the mayor
 wouldn't see me unless I stated my business first."" He drew in
 a deep breath. ""So I stated it. And then I was gently but firmly
 ushered back into the street again.""


 ""They didn't believe you,"" said Morgan.


 ""Not for a minute. They laughed in my face.""


 Morgan nodded. ""I'm beginning to get the pattern. So what
 did you do next?""


 ""Next I tried the police. I got the same treatment there,
 only they weren't so gentle. They wouldn't listen either. They
 muttered something about cranks and their crazy notions, and
 when they asked me where I lived, they thought I was—what
 did they call it?—a wise guy! Told me to get out and not come
 back with any more wild stories.""


 ""I see,"" said Morgan.


 Jefferson Parks finished his last bite of pie and pushed the
 plate away. ""By then I didn't know quite what to do. I'd been
 prepared for almost anything excepting this. It was frightening.
 I tried to rationalize it, and then I quit trying. It wasn't
 that I attracted attention, or anything like that, quite the contrary.
 Nobody even looked at me, unless I said something to
 them. I began to look for things that were
different
, things that
 I could show them, and say, see, this proves that I'm telling
 the truth, look at it—"" He looked up helplessly.


 ""And what did you find?""


 ""Nothing. Oh, little things, insignificant little things. Your
 calendars, for instance. Naturally, I couldn't understand your
 frame of reference. And the coinage, you stamp your coins; we
 don't. And cigarettes. We don't have any such thing as tobacco.""
 The man gave a short laugh. ""And your house dogs!
 We have little animals that look more like rabbits than poodles.
 But there was nothing any more significant than that. Absolutely
 nothing.""


 ""Except yourself,"" Morgan said.


 ""Ah, yes. I thought that over carefully. I looked for differences,
 obvious ones. I couldn't find any. You can see that, just
 looking at me. So I searched for more subtle things. Skin texture,
 fingerprints, bone structure, body proportion. I still
 couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.""


 Morgan's eyebrows lifted. ""Good,"" he said.


 Parks shrugged tiredly. ""Not really. He examined me. He
 practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying
 anything about who I was or where I came from; just said
 I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go
 to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me
 on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry
 about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human
 being as I've ever seen.' And that was that."" Parks laughed
 bitterly. ""I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,
 and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it
 defied reason, it was infuriating.""


 Morgan nodded sourly. ""Because you're not a human
 being,"" he said.


 ""That's right. I'm not a human being at all.""
""How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?""
 Morgan asked curiously. ""There must have been a million
 others to choose from.""


 Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin
 unhappily. ""I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.
 Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket
 you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you
 pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.
 The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned
 scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until
 it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When
 it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it
 and send through a manned scout."" He grinned sourly. ""Like
 me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they
 leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until
 we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the
 directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an
 infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting
 from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of
 space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.""


 He shook his head wearily. ""We're new at it, Morgan. We've
 only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in
 technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for
 over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much
 good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it
 looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner
 picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then
 something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried
 to make contact again, the scanner was gone!""


 ""And you found things here the same as back home,"" said
 Morgan.


 ""The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.
 Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are
 the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the
 same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.
 Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on
 the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent
 life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to
 tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,
they
 won't believe me
!""


 ""Why should they?"" asked Morgan. ""You look like a human
 being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.
 What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.""


 ""
But it's true.
""


 Morgan shrugged. ""So it's true. I won't argue with you. But
 as I asked before, even if I
did
believe you, what do you
 expect
me
to do about it? Why pick
me
, of all the people you've
 seen?""


 There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. ""I was tired, tired
 of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as
 though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.
 You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then
 I found out you wrote stories."" He looked up eagerly. ""I've
 got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.
 And think what it would mean to both of our worlds—contact
 with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,
 our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!""


 He leaned forward, his thin face intense. ""I need money and
 I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,
 know some of the design, some of the power and wiring
 principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.
 They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.
 But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government
 won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.""


 ""Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their
 hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and
 rockets to the moon to sink their money into."" Morgan stared
 at the man. ""But what can
I
do?""


 ""You can
write
! That's what you can do. You can tell the
 world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I
 know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must
 be the same in yours.""


 Morgan didn't move. He just stared. ""How many people
 have you talked to?"" he asked.


 ""A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.""


 ""And how many believed you?""


 ""None.""


 ""You mean
nobody
would believe you?""


 ""
Not one soul.
Until I talked to you.""


 And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears
 rolling down his cheeks. ""And I'm the one man who couldn't
 help you if my life depended on it,"" he gasped.


 ""You believe me?""


 Morgan nodded sadly. ""I believe you. Yes. I think your
 warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own
 planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.""


 ""Then you
can
help me.""


 ""I'm afraid not.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""Because I'd be worse than no help at all.""


 Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white.
 ""Why?"" he cried hoarsely. ""If you believe me, why can't you
 help me?""


 Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. ""I write,
 yes,"" he said sadly. ""Ever read stories like this before?""


 Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover.
 ""I barely looked at it.""


 ""You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue.
 The readers thought it was very interesting,"" Morgan grinned.
 ""Go ahead, look at it.""


 The stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine,
 stopped at a page that carried Roger Morgan's name. His eyes
 caught the first paragraph and he turned white. He set the
 magazine down with a trembling hand. ""I see,"" he said, and
 the life was gone out of his voice. He spread the pages viciously,
 read the lines again.


 The paragraph said:


 ""Just suppose,"" said Martin, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the table.
 ""Where do we go from here?""

 couldn't find anything. Then I went to a doctor.""


 Morgan's eyebrows lifted. ""Good,"" he said.


 Parks shrugged tiredly. ""Not really. He examined me. He
 practically took me apart. I carefully refrained from saying
 anything about who I was or where I came from; just said
 I wanted a complete physical examination, and let him go
 to it. He was thorough, and when he finished he patted me
 on the back and said, 'Parks, you've got nothing to worry
 about. You're as fine, strapping a specimen of a healthy human
 being as I've ever seen.' And that was that."" Parks laughed
 bitterly. ""I guess I was supposed to be happy with the verdict,
 and instead I was ready to knock him down. It was idiotic, it
 defied reason, it was infuriating.""


 Morgan nodded sourly. ""Because you're not a human
 being,"" he said.


 ""That's right. I'm not a human being at all.""
""How did you happen to pick this planet, or this sun?""
 Morgan asked curiously. ""There must have been a million
 others to choose from.""


 Parks unbuttoned his collar and rubbed his stubbled chin
 unhappily. ""I didn't make the choice. Neither did anyone else.
 Travel by warp is a little different from travel by the rocket
 you fiction writers make so much of. With a rocket vehicle you
 pick your destination, make your calculations, and off you go.
 The warp is blind flying, strictly blind. We send an unmanned
 scanner ahead. It probes around more or less hit-or-miss until
 it locates something, somewhere, that looks habitable. When
 it spots a likely looking place, we keep a tight beam on it
 and send through a manned scout."" He grinned sourly. ""Like
 me. If it looks good to the scout, he signals back, and they
 leave the warp anchored for a sort of permanent gateway until
 we can get a transport beam built. But we can't control the
 directional and dimensional scope of the warp. There are an
 infinity of ways it can go, until we have a guide beam transmitting
 from the other side. Then we can just scan a segment of
 space with the warp, and the scanner picks up the beam.""


 He shook his head wearily. ""We're new at it, Morgan. We've
 only tried a few dozen runs. We're not too far ahead of you in
 technology. We've been using rocket vehicles just like yours for
 over a century. That's fine for a solar system, but it's not much
 good for the stars. When the warp principle was discovered, it
 looked like the answer. But something went wrong, the scanner
 picked up this planet, and I was coming through, and then
 something blew. Next thing I knew I was falling. When I tried
 to make contact again, the scanner was gone!""


 ""And you found things here the same as back home,"" said
 Morgan.


 ""The same! Your planet and mine are practically twins.
 Similar cities, similar technology, everything. The people are
 the same, with precisely the same anatomy and physiology, the
 same sort of laws, the same institutions, even compatible languages.
 Can't you see the importance of it? This planet is on
 the other side of the universe from mine, with the first intelligent
 life we've yet encountered anywhere. But when I try to
 tell your people that I'm a native of another star system,
they
 won't believe me
!""


 ""Why should they?"" asked Morgan. ""You look like a human
 being. You talk like one. You eat like one. You act like one.
 What you're asking them to believe is utterly incredible.""


 ""
But it's true.
""


 Morgan shrugged. ""So it's true. I won't argue with you. But
 as I asked before, even if I
did
believe you, what do you
 expect
me
to do about it? Why pick
me
, of all the people you've
 seen?""


 There was a desperate light in Parks' eyes. ""I was tired, tired
 of being laughed at, tired of having people looking at me as
 though I'd lost my wits when I tried to tell them the truth.
 You were here, you were alone, so I started talking. And then
 I found out you wrote stories."" He looked up eagerly. ""I've
 got to get back, Morgan, somehow. My life is there, my family.
 And think what it would mean to both of our worlds—contact
 with another intelligent race! Combine our knowledges,
 our technologies, and we could explore the galaxy!""


 He leaned forward, his thin face intense. ""I need money and
 I need help. I know some of the mathematics of the warp principle,
 know some of the design, some of the power and wiring
 principles. You have engineers here, technologists, physicists.
 They could fill in what I don't know and build a guide beam.
 But they won't do it if they don't believe me. Your government
 won't listen to me, they won't appropriate any money.""


 ""Of course they won't. They've got a war or two on their
 hands, they have public welfare, and atomic bombs, and
 rockets to the moon to sink their money into."" Morgan stared
 at the man. ""But what can
I
do?""


 ""You can
write
! That's what you can do. You can tell the
 world about me, you can tell exactly what has happened. I
 know how public interest can be aroused in my world. It must
 be the same in yours.""


 Morgan didn't move. He just stared. ""How many people
 have you talked to?"" he asked.


 ""A dozen, a hundred, maybe a thousand.""


 ""And how many believed you?""


 ""None.""


 ""You mean
nobody
would believe you?""


 ""
Not one soul.
Until I talked to you.""


 And then Morgan was laughing, laughing bitterly, tears
 rolling down his cheeks. ""And I'm the one man who couldn't
 help you if my life depended on it,"" he gasped.


 ""You believe me?""


 Morgan nodded sadly. ""I believe you. Yes. I think your
 warp brought you through to a parallel universe of your own
 planet, not to another star, but I think you're telling the truth.""


 ""Then you
can
help me.""


 ""I'm afraid not.""


 ""Why not?""


 ""Because I'd be worse than no help at all.""


 Jefferson Parks gripped the table, his knuckles white.
 ""Why?"" he cried hoarsely. ""If you believe me, why can't you
 help me?""


 Morgan pointed to the magazine lying on the table. ""I write,
 yes,"" he said sadly. ""Ever read stories like this before?""


 Parks picked up the magazine, glanced at the bright cover.
 ""I barely looked at it.""


 ""You should look more closely. I have a story in this issue.
 The readers thought it was very interesting,"" Morgan grinned.
 ""Go ahead, look at it.""


 The stranger from the stars leafed through the magazine,
 stopped at a page that carried Roger Morgan's name. His eyes
 caught the first paragraph and he turned white. He set the
 magazine down with a trembling hand. ""I see,"" he said, and
 the life was gone out of his voice. He spread the pages viciously,
 read the lines again.


 The paragraph said:


 ""Just suppose,"" said Martin, ""that I
did
believe you. Just
 for argument."" He glanced up at the man across the table.
 ""Where do we go from here?""

 Not a real, workable device.

 Except for the way it could work

 under a man's mental skin....
BY HARRY HARRISON
Because there were few adults in
 the crowd, and Colonel ""Biff"" Hawton
 stood over six feet tall, he could
 see every detail of the demonstration.
 The children—and most of the
 parents—gaped in wide-eyed wonder.
 Biff Hawton was too sophisticated
 to be awed. He stayed on because
 he wanted to find out what the
 trick was that made the gadget work.


 ""It's all explained right here in
 your instruction book,"" the demonstrator
 said, holding up a garishly
 printed booklet opened to a four-color
 diagram. ""You all know how
 magnets pick up things and I bet
 you even know that the earth itself is
 one great big magnet—that's why
 compasses always point north. Well
 ... the Atomic Wonder Space
 Wave Tapper hangs onto those space
 waves. Invisibly all about us, and
 even going right through us, are the
 magnetic waves of the earth. The
 Atomic Wonder rides these waves
 just the way a ship rides the waves
 in the ocean. Now watch....""


 Every eye was on him as he put the
 gaudy model rocketship on top of the
 table and stepped back. It was made
 of stamped metal and seemed as incapable
 of flying as a can of ham—which
 it very much resembled. Neither
 wings, propellors, nor jets broke
 through the painted surface. It rested
 on three rubber wheels and coming
 out through the bottom was a double
 strand of thin insulated wire. This
 white wire ran across the top of the
 black table and terminated in a control
 box in the demonstrator's hand.
 An indicator light, a switch and a
 knob appeared to be the only controls.


 ""I turn on the Power Switch, sending
 a surge of current to the Wave
 Receptors,"" he said. The switch
 clicked and the light blinked on and
 off with a steady pulse. Then the
 man began to slowly turn the knob.
 ""A careful touch on the Wave Generator
 is necessary as we are dealing
 with the powers of the whole world
 here....""


 A concerted
ahhhh
swept through
 the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper
 shivered a bit, then rose slowly into
 the air. The demonstrator stepped
 back and the toy rose higher and
 higher, bobbing gently on the invisible
 waves of magnetic force that
 supported it. Ever so slowly the power
 was reduced and it settled back to
 the table.


 ""Only $17.95,"" the young man
 said, putting a large price sign on the
 table. ""For the complete set of the
 Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper
 control box, battery and instruction
 book ...""


 At the appearance of the price
 card the crowd broke up noisily and
 the children rushed away towards the
 operating model trains. The demonstrator's
 words were lost in their
 noisy passage, and after a moment he
 sank into a gloomy silence. He put
 the control box down, yawned and
 sat on the edge of the table. Colonel
 Hawton was the only one left after
 the crowd had moved on.


 ""Could you tell me how this thing
 works?"" the colonel asked, coming
 forward. The demonstrator brightened
 up and picked up one of the
 toys.


 ""Well, if you will look here,
 sir...."" He opened the hinged top.
 ""You will see the Space Wave coils
 at each end of the ship."" With a pencil
 he pointed out the odd shaped
 plastic forms about an inch in diameter
 that had been wound—apparently
 at random—with a few turns of
 copper wire. Except for these coils
 the interior of the model was empty.
 The coils were wired together and
 other wires ran out through the hole
 in the bottom of the control box.
 Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
 eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
 who completely ignored this
 sign of disbelief.


 ""Inside the control box is the battery,""
 the young man said, snapping
 it open and pointing to an ordinary
 flashlight battery. ""The current goes
 through the Power Switch and Power
 Light to the Wave Generator ...""


 ""What you mean to say,"" Biff
 broke in, ""is that the juice from this
 fifteen cent battery goes through this
 cheap rheostat to those meaningless
 coils in the model and absolutely
 nothing happens. Now tell me what
 really flies the thing. If I'm going to
 drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
 worth of tin, I want to know what
 I'm getting.""


 The demonstrator flushed. ""I'm
 sorry, sir,"" he stammered. ""I wasn't
 trying to hide anything. Like any
 magic trick this one can't be really
 demonstrated until it has been purchased.""
 He leaned forward and whispered
 confidentially. ""I'll tell you
 what I'll do though. This thing is way
 overpriced and hasn't been moving at
 all. The manager said I could let them
 go at three dollars if I could find any
 takers. If you want to buy it for that
 price....""


 ""Sold, my boy!"" the colonel said,
 slamming three bills down on the
 table. ""I'll give that much for it no
 matter
how
it works. The boys in the
 shop will get a kick out of it,"" he
 tapped the winged rocket on his
 chest. ""Now
really
—what holds it
 up?""


 The demonstrator looked around
 carefully, then pointed. ""Strings!"" he
 said. ""Or rather a black thread. It
 runs from the top of the model,
 through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
 and back down to my hand—tied to
 this ring on my finger. When I back
 up—the model rises. It's as simple as
 that.""


 ""All good illusions are simple,""
 the colonel grunted, tracing the black
 thread with his eye. ""As long as
 there is plenty of flimflam to distract
 the viewer.""


 ""If you don't have a black table, a
 black cloth will do,"" the young man
 said. ""And the arch of a doorway is a
 good site, just see that the room in
 back is dark.""


 ""Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
 yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
 kind of thing.""
Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
 Thursday-night poker party. The
 gang were all missile men and they
 cheered and jeered as he hammed
 up the introduction.


 ""Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
 could use some of those magnetic
 waves in the new bird!""


 ""Those flashlight batteries are
 cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
 the future!""


 Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
 the flight began. He was an amateur
 magician and spotted the gimmick at
 once. He kept silent with professional
 courtesy, and smiled ironically as
 the rest of the bunch grew silent one
 by one. The colonel was a good showman
 and he had set the scene well.
 He almost had them believing in the
 Space Wave Tapper before he was
 through. When the model had landed
 and he had switched it off he couldn't
 stop them from crowding around
 the table.


 ""A thread!"" one of the engineers
 shouted, almost with relief, and they
 all laughed along with him.


 ""Too bad,"" the head project physicist
 said, ""I was hoping that a little
 Space Wave Tapping could help us
 out. Let me try a flight with it.""


 ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced.
 ""He spotted it while you
 were all watching the flashing lights,
 only he didn't say anything.""


 Kaner slipped the ring with the
 black thread over his finger and started
 to step back.


 ""You have to turn the switch on
 first,"" Biff said.


 ""I know,"" Kaner smiled. ""But
 that's part of illusion—the spiel and
 the misdirection. I'm going to try
 this cold first, so I can get it moving
 up and down smoothly, then go
 through it with the whole works.""

ILLUSTRATED BY BREY

 He moved his hand back smoothly,
 in a professional manner that drew
 no attention to it. The model lifted
 from the table—then crashed back
 down.


 ""The thread broke,"" Kaner said.


 ""You jerked it, instead of pulling
 smoothly,"" Biff said and knotted the
 broken thread. ""Here let me show
 you how to do it.""


 The thread broke again when Biff
 tried it, which got a good laugh that
 made his collar a little warm. Someone
 mentioned the poker game.


 This was the only time that poker
 was mentioned or even remembered
 that night. Because very soon after
 this they found that the thread would
 lift the model only when the switch
 was on and two and a half volts
 flowing through the joke coils. With
 the current turned off the model was
 too heavy to lift. The thread broke
 every time.
""I still think it's a screwy idea,""
 the young man said. ""One week getting
 fallen arches, demonstrating
 those toy ships for every brat within
 a thousand miles. Then selling the
 things for three bucks when they
 must have cost at least a hundred dollars
 apiece to make.""


 ""But you
did
sell the ten of them
 to people who would be interested?""
 the older man asked.


 ""I think so, I caught a few Air
 Force officers and a colonel in missiles
 one day. Then there was one official
 I remembered from the Bureau
 of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize
 me. Then those two professors
 you spotted from the university.""


 ""Then the problem is out of our
 hands and into theirs. All we have to
 do now is sit back and wait for results.""


 ""
What
results?! These people
 weren't interested when we were
 hammering on their doors with the
 proof. We've patented the coils and
 can prove to anyone that there is a
 reduction in weight around them
 when they are operating....""


 ""But a small reduction. And we
 don't know what is causing it. No
 one can be interested in a thing like
 that—a fractional weight decrease in
 a clumsy model, certainly not enough
 to lift the weight of the generator.
 No one wrapped up in massive fuel
 consumption, tons of lift and such is
 going to have time to worry about a
 crackpot who thinks he has found a
 minor slip in Newton's laws.""


 ""You think they will now?"" the
 young man asked, cracking his knuckles
 impatiently.


 ""I
know
they will. The tensile
 strength of that thread is correctly adjusted
 to the weight of the model.
 The thread will break if you try to
 lift the model with it. Yet you can
 lift the model—after a small increment
 of its weight has been removed
 by the coils. This is going to bug
 these men. Nobody is going to ask
 them to solve the problem or concern
 themselves with it. But it will
 nag at them because they know this
 effect can't possibly exist. They'll see
 at once that the magnetic-wave theory
 is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We
 don't know. But they will all be
 thinking about it and worrying about
 it. Someone is going to experiment
 in his basement—just as a hobby of
 course—to find the cause of the error.
 And he or someone else is going
 to find out what makes those coils
 work, or maybe a way to improve
 them!""


 ""And we have the patents....""


 ""Correct. They will be doing the
 research that will take them out of
 the massive-lift-propulsion business
 and into the field of pure space
 flight.""


 ""And in doing so they will be making
 us rich—whenever the time
 comes to manufacture,"" the young
 man said cynically.


 ""We'll all be rich, son,"" the older
 man said, patting him on the shoulder.
 ""Believe me, you're not going to
 recognize this old world ten years
 from now.""

37,"The gadget was strictly,

 beyond any question, a toy.

 Not a real, workable device.

 Except for the way it could work

 under a man's mental skin....
BY HARRY HARRISON
Because there were few adults in
 the crowd, and Colonel ""Biff"" Hawton
 stood over six feet tall, he could
 see every detail of the demonstration.
 The children—and most of the
 parents—gaped in wide-eyed wonder.
 Biff Hawton was too sophisticated
 to be awed. He stayed on because
 he wanted to find out what the
 trick was that made the gadget work.


 ""It's all explained right here in
 your instruction book,"" the demonstrator
 said, holding up a garishly
 printed booklet opened to a four-color
 diagram. ""You all know how
 magnets pick up things and I bet
 you even know that the earth itself is
 one great big magnet—that's why
 compasses always point north. Well
 ... the Atomic Wonder Space
 Wave Tapper hangs onto those space
 waves. Invisibly all about us, and
 even going right through us, are the
 magnetic waves of the earth. The
 Atomic Wonder rides these waves
 just the way a ship rides the waves
 in the ocean. Now watch....""


 Every eye was on him as he put the
 gaudy model rocketship on top of the
 table and stepped back. It was made
 of stamped metal and seemed as incapable
 of flying as a can of ham—which
 it very much resembled. Neither
 wings, propellors, nor jets broke
 through the painted surface. It rested
 on three rubber wheels and coming
 out through the bottom was a double
 strand of thin insulated wire. This
 white wire ran across the top of the
 black table and terminated in a control
 box in the demonstrator's hand.
 An indicator light, a switch and a
 knob appeared to be the only controls.


 ""I turn on the Power Switch, sending
 a surge of current to the Wave
 Receptors,"" he said. The switch
 clicked and the light blinked on and
 off with a steady pulse. Then the
 man began to slowly turn the knob.
 ""A careful touch on the Wave Generator
 is necessary as we are dealing
 with the powers of the whole world
 here....""


 A concerted
ahhhh
swept through
 the crowd as the Space Wave Tapper
 shivered a bit, then rose slowly into
 the air. The demonstrator stepped
 back and the toy rose higher and
 higher, bobbing gently on the invisible
 waves of magnetic force that
 supported it. Ever so slowly the power
 was reduced and it settled back to
 the table.


 ""Only $17.95,"" the young man
 said, putting a large price sign on the
 table. ""For the complete set of the
 Atomic Wonder, the Space Tapper
 control box, battery and instruction
 book ...""


 At the appearance of the price
 card the crowd broke up noisily and
 the children rushed away towards the
 operating model trains. The demonstrator's
 words were lost in their
 noisy passage, and after a moment he
 sank into a gloomy silence. He put
 the control box down, yawned and
 sat on the edge of the table. Colonel
 Hawton was the only one left after
 the crowd had moved on.


 ""Could you tell me how this thing
 works?"" the colonel asked, coming
 forward. The demonstrator brightened
 up and picked up one of the
 toys.


 ""Well, if you will look here,
 sir...."" He opened the hinged top.
 ""You will see the Space Wave coils
 at each end of the ship."" With a pencil
 he pointed out the odd shaped
 plastic forms about an inch in diameter
 that had been wound—apparently
 at random—with a few turns of
 copper wire. Except for these coils
 the interior of the model was empty.
 The coils were wired together and
 other wires ran out through the hole
 in the bottom of the control box.
 Biff Hawton turned a very quizzical
 eye on the gadget and upon the demonstrator
 who completely ignored this
 sign of disbelief.


 ""Inside the control box is the battery,""
 the young man said, snapping
 it open and pointing to an ordinary
 flashlight battery. ""The current goes
 through the Power Switch and Power
 Light to the Wave Generator ...""


 ""What you mean to say,"" Biff
 broke in, ""is that the juice from this
 fifteen cent battery goes through this
 cheap rheostat to those meaningless
 coils in the model and absolutely
 nothing happens. Now tell me what
 really flies the thing. If I'm going to
 drop eighteen bucks for six-bits
 worth of tin, I want to know what
 I'm getting.""


 The demonstrator flushed. ""I'm
 sorry, sir,"" he stammered. ""I wasn't
 trying to hide anything. Like any
 magic trick this one can't be really
 demonstrated until it has been purchased.""
 He leaned forward and whispered
 confidentially. ""I'll tell you
 what I'll do though. This thing is way
 overpriced and hasn't been moving at
 all. The manager said I could let them
 go at three dollars if I could find any
 takers. If you want to buy it for that
 price....""


 ""Sold, my boy!"" the colonel said,
 slamming three bills down on the
 table. ""I'll give that much for it no
 matter
how
it works. The boys in the
 shop will get a kick out of it,"" he
 tapped the winged rocket on his
 chest. ""Now
really
—what holds it
 up?""


 The demonstrator looked around
 carefully, then pointed. ""Strings!"" he
 said. ""Or rather a black thread. It
 runs from the top of the model,
 through a tiny loop in the ceiling,
 and back down to my hand—tied to
 this ring on my finger. When I back
 up—the model rises. It's as simple as
 that.""


 ""All good illusions are simple,""
 the colonel grunted, tracing the black
 thread with his eye. ""As long as
 there is plenty of flimflam to distract
 the viewer.""


 ""If you don't have a black table, a
 black cloth will do,"" the young man
 said. ""And the arch of a doorway is a
 good site, just see that the room in
 back is dark.""


 ""Wrap it up, my boy, I wasn't born
 yesterday. I'm an old hand at this
 kind of thing.""
Biff Hawton sprang it at the next
 Thursday-night poker party. The
 gang were all missile men and they
 cheered and jeered as he hammed
 up the introduction.


 ""Let me copy the diagram, Biff, I
 could use some of those magnetic
 waves in the new bird!""


 ""Those flashlight batteries are
 cheaper than lox, this is the thing of
 the future!""


 Only Teddy Kaner caught wise as
 the flight began. He was an amateur
 magician and spotted the gimmick at
 once. He kept silent with professional
 courtesy, and smiled ironically as
 the rest of the bunch grew silent one
 by one. The colonel was a good showman
 and he had set the scene well.
 He almost had them believing in the
 Space Wave Tapper before he was
 through. When the model had landed
 and he had switched it off he couldn't
 stop them from crowding around
 the table.


 ""A thread!"" one of the engineers
 shouted, almost with relief, and they
 all laughed along with him.


 ""Too bad,"" the head project physicist
 said, ""I was hoping that a little
 Space Wave Tapping could help us
 out. Let me try a flight with it.""


 ""Teddy Kaner first,"" Biff announced.
 ""He spotted it while you
 were all watching the flashing lights,
 only he didn't say anything.""


 Kaner slipped the ring with the
 black thread over his finger and started
 to step back.


 ""You have to turn the switch on
 first,"" Biff said.


 ""I know,"" Kaner smiled. ""But
 that's part of illusion—the spiel and
 the misdirection. I'm going to try
 this cold first, so I can get it moving
 up and down smoothly, then go
 through it with the whole works.""

ILLUSTRATED BY BREY

 He moved his hand back smoothly,
 in a professional manner that drew
 no attention to it. The model lifted
 from the table—then crashed back
 down.


 ""The thread broke,"" Kaner said.


 ""You jerked it, instead of pulling
 smoothly,"" Biff said and knotted the
 broken thread. ""Here let me show
 you how to do it.""


 The thread broke again when Biff
 tried it, which got a good laugh that
 made his collar a little warm. Someone
 mentioned the poker game.


 This was the only time that poker
 was mentioned or even remembered
 that night. Because very soon after
 this they found that the thread would
 lift the model only when the switch
 was on and two and a half volts
 flowing through the joke coils. With
 the current turned off the model was
 too heavy to lift. The thread broke
 every time.
""I still think it's a screwy idea,""
 the young man said. ""One week getting
 fallen arches, demonstrating
 those toy ships for every brat within
 a thousand miles. Then selling the
 things for three bucks when they
 must have cost at least a hundred dollars
 apiece to make.""


 ""But you
did
sell the ten of them
 to people who would be interested?""
 the older man asked.


 ""I think so, I caught a few Air
 Force officers and a colonel in missiles
 one day. Then there was one official
 I remembered from the Bureau
 of Standards. Luckily he didn't recognize
 me. Then those two professors
 you spotted from the university.""


 ""Then the problem is out of our
 hands and into theirs. All we have to
 do now is sit back and wait for results.""


 ""
What
results?! These people
 weren't interested when we were
 hammering on their doors with the
 proof. We've patented the coils and
 can prove to anyone that there is a
 reduction in weight around them
 when they are operating....""


 ""But a small reduction. And we
 don't know what is causing it. No
 one can be interested in a thing like
 that—a fractional weight decrease in
 a clumsy model, certainly not enough
 to lift the weight of the generator.
 No one wrapped up in massive fuel
 consumption, tons of lift and such is
 going to have time to worry about a
 crackpot who thinks he has found a
 minor slip in Newton's laws.""


 ""You think they will now?"" the
 young man asked, cracking his knuckles
 impatiently.


 ""I
know
they will. The tensile
 strength of that thread is correctly adjusted
 to the weight of the model.
 The thread will break if you try to
 lift the model with it. Yet you can
 lift the model—after a small increment
 of its weight has been removed
 by the coils. This is going to bug
 these men. Nobody is going to ask
 them to solve the problem or concern
 themselves with it. But it will
 nag at them because they know this
 effect can't possibly exist. They'll see
 at once that the magnetic-wave theory
 is nonsense. Or perhaps true? We
 don't know. But they will all be
 thinking about it and worrying about
 it. Someone is going to experiment
 in his basement—just as a hobby of
 course—to find the cause of the error.
 And he or someone else is going
 to find out what makes those coils
 work, or maybe a way to improve
 them!""


 ""And we have the patents....""


 ""Correct. They will be doing the
 research that will take them out of
 the massive-lift-propulsion business
 and into the field of pure space
 flight.""


 ""And in doing so they will be making
 us rich—whenever the time
 comes to manufacture,"" the young
 man said cynically.


 ""We'll all be rich, son,"" the older
 man said, patting him on the shoulder.
 ""Believe me, you're not going to
 recognize this old world ten years
 from now.""

When Joseph got to the office his ears were aching from the noise of
 the copter and from his earplugs. Lately, every little thing seemed to
 make him irritable. He supposed it was because his drafting department
 was behind schedule on the latest Defense contract. His ears were sore
 and his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.


 Walking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The
 constant clatter of typewriters and office machines gave him a sense
 of efficiency, of stability, an all-is-well-with-the-world feeling. He
 waved to a few of the more familiar employees and smiled, but of course
 you couldn't say hello with the continual racket.


 This morning, somehow, it didn't make him feel better. He supposed it
 was because of the song they were playing over the speakers, ""Slam Bang
 Boom,"" the latest Top Hit. He hated that song.


 Of course the National Mental Health people said constant music had a
 beneficial effect on office workers, so Joseph was no one to object,
 even though he did wonder if anyone could ever actually listen to it
 over the other noise.


 In his own office the steady din was hardly diminished despite
 soundproofing, and since he was next to an outside wall he was
 subjected also to the noises of the city. He stood staring out of the
 huge window for awhile, watching the cars on the freeway and listening
 to the homogeneous rumble and scream of turbines.
Something's wrong with me
, he thought.
I shouldn't be feeling this
 way. Nerves. Nerves.
He turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She
 simpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.


 ""Betty,"" he told her, ""I want you to make an appointment with my
 therapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it's just a case of nerves,
 though.""


 ""Yes sir. Anything else?"" Her voice, like every one's, was a high
 pitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.


 Joseph winced. ""Anybody want to see me this morning?""


 ""Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to
 show you.""


 ""Let him in whenever he's ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes
 up, I want you to leave me alone.""


 ""Yes, sir, certainly."" She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile
 that seemed to want to be something more.


 Joseph switched off.
That was a damn funny way of saying it
, he thought.
""I want you to
 leave me alone."" As if somebody were after me.
He spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed
 up so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.


 ""I'm afraid you'll have to make it brief, Bob,"" he grinned. ""I've a
 whale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting
 headache. Nerves, you know.""


 ""Sure, Mister Partch. I won't take a minute; I just thought you'd like
 to have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our
 progress so far....""


 ""Yes, yes, just go ahead. How does the thing work?""


 Bob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch's desk, sat down in
 front of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.


 It was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It
 was one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly
 air-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs—and
 that helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem
 by using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons
 were the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a
 technological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from
 a commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men
 mad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly
 satisfactory solution.


 But now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A
 device that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound
 waves, leaving behind only heat.


 It should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn't make
 himself get interested in it.


 ""The really big problem is the power requirement,"" Wills was saying.
 ""We've got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but
 we've got several possible answers in mind and we're working on all of
 them.""


 He caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.


 ""The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a
 static test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty
 fair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the
 noise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. Of course, I still needed my
 plugs.""


 Joseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of
 transistors and tubes.


 ""I've built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current,"" Wills told
 him. ""In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody.""


 Partch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.


 ""Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don't you just leave
 it here in my office and I'll look it over later, hm?""


 ""Okay, Mr. Partch.""


 Joseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on
 the good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone
 again behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden
 yearning for company, for someone to talk to.
Partch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk
 nibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he
 was getting an ulcer.


 Yes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.
 Coles that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his
 feeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk
 about it.


 Oh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was
 it. A rut.


 He spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the
 automatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.


 Joseph winced. The speakers were playing ""Slam Bang Boom"" again.


 His mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look
 inward on himself.


 Of what, after all, did Joseph Partch's life consist? He licked his
 fingers and thought about it.


 What would he do this evening after work, for instance?


 Why, he'd stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the
 commuter's copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming
 of the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played
 on the copter's speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise
 and through the plugs.


 And then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his
 wife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from
 the automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.
 Perhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.


 Partch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day's
 work, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen
 bomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of
 knowing when.


 And what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?
 Why, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen
 years. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the
 musical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the
 loud songs....


 And every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of
 Felicia's friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.


 Perhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks
 and talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.


 There would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of
 the monorail horn at intervals.


 And then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the
 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.


 Joseph Partch's world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.
 Dimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if
 all the sounds were once taken away.
Why
, after all, was the world
 of Man so noisy? It was almost as if—as if everybody were making as
 much noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something
 lacking. Or something they were afraid of.


 Like a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.


 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound
 and noise.


 Almost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of
space
would
 be like.


 And then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills' machine. It could
 reduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had
 said. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a
 rocket motor.


 And the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.


 Partch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....


 But what would Dr. Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to
 get a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....


 But looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line
 cord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph's body. The
 sense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn't recognize it yet.


 An absence of
sound
? No! Silly!


 Then a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the
 window, filling the office with an ocean of noise.


 Joseph's hand jerked and flicked the switch.


 And then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before
 that had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came
 back to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.


 In the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a
real
forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human
 civilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.


 It was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. There was no
 wind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,
completely
alone.


 And it was—quiet.


 Doctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.


 ""I've only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.
 Leeds.""


 Leeds nodded.


 ""It
is
rather rare. Look at him—total catatonia. He's curled into a
 perfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I'm afraid.""


 ""The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially
 to a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.""


 ""Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills' is extremely dangerous. What amazes
 me is that it didn't kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him
 when we did.""


 Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw.


 ""Yes, you know it
is
incredible how much the human mind can sometimes
 take, actually. As you say, it's a wonder it didn't kill him.""


 He shook his head.


 ""Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he
 was alone with that machine. Imagine—
two hours
of total silence!""

 the automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.
 Perhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.


 Partch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day's
 work, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen
 bomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of
 knowing when.


 And what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?
 Why, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen
 years. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the
 musical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the
 loud songs....


 And every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of
 Felicia's friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.


 Perhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks
 and talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.


 There would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of
 the monorail horn at intervals.


 And then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the
 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.


 Joseph Partch's world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.
 Dimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if
 all the sounds were once taken away.
Why
, after all, was the world
 of Man so noisy? It was almost as if—as if everybody were making as
 much noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something
 lacking. Or something they were afraid of.


 Like a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.


 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound
 and noise.


 Almost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of
space
would
 be like.


 And then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills' machine. It could
 reduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had
 said. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a
 rocket motor.


 And the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.


 Partch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....


 But what would Dr. Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to
 get a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....


 But looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line
 cord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph's body. The
 sense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn't recognize it yet.


 An absence of
sound
? No! Silly!


 Then a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the
 window, filling the office with an ocean of noise.


 Joseph's hand jerked and flicked the switch.


 And then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before
 that had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came
 back to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.


 In the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a
real
forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human
 civilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.


 It was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. There was no
 wind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,
completely
alone.


 And it was—quiet.


 Doctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.


 ""I've only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.
 Leeds.""


 Leeds nodded.


 ""It
is
rather rare. Look at him—total catatonia. He's curled into a
 perfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I'm afraid.""


 ""The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially
 to a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.""


 ""Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills' is extremely dangerous. What amazes
 me is that it didn't kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him
 when we did.""


 Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw.


 ""Yes, you know it
is
incredible how much the human mind can sometimes
 take, actually. As you say, it's a wonder it didn't kill him.""


 He shook his head.


 ""Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he
 was alone with that machine. Imagine—
two hours
of total silence!""

By MARGARET ST. CLAIR
Being a wizard missionary to
 
the Free'l needed more than
 
magic—it called for a miracle!
[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

The spell the Free'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down
 from the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the
 seasons. But, since they had got broor's blood instead of newt's, were
 using alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than
 the solstice anyhow, nothing happened.


 Neeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.


 He'd tried hard with them. The Free'l were really a challenge to
 evangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was
 evinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were
 interested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply
 wouldn't take the trouble to do it right.


 How long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since
 early moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on
 stamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.


 Neeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,
 looked up from his drumming.


 ""Go away,"" he said. ""You'll spoil the charm.""


 ""What charm? Can't you see by now, Rhn, that it isn't going to work?""


 ""Of course it will. It just takes time.""


 ""Hell it will. Hell it does. Watch.""


 Neeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the
 circle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon's
 blood, oil of anointing, and salt.


 He drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon's blood
 at the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with
 the oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,
 which was just coming up, he touched the
outer
cusps with salt. An
 intense smoke sprang up.
When the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in
 the parallelogram.


 ""Tell the demon what you want,"" Neeshan ordered the Free'l.


 The Free'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of
 the things that made teaching them magic difficult.


 ""Two big dyla melons,"" one of the younger ones said at last.


 ""A new andana necklace,"" said another.


 ""A tooter like the one you have,"" said Rhn, who was ambitious.


 ""Straw for a new roof on my hut,"" said one of the older females.


 ""That's enough for now,"" Neeshan interrupted. ""The demon can't bring
 you a tooter, Rhn—you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The
 other things he can get. Sammel, to work!""


 The lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and
 returned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an
 enormous heap of straw.


 ""Can I go now?"" it asked.


 ""Yes."" Neeshan turned to the Free'l, who were sharing the dyla melons
 out around their circle. ""You see?
That's
how it ought to be. You
 cast a spell. You're careful with it. And it works. Right away.""


 ""When you do it, it works,"" Rhn answered.


 ""Magic works when
anybody
does it. But you have to do it right.""


 Rhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. ""It's such a lot
 of dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun."" He walked away,
 munching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.


 Neeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. ""Dreeze"" was a Free'l word that
 referred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race's
 virulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything
 annoying. The Free'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,
 had a lot of colds in the head.


 Wasn't there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest
 spell was too dreezish for them to bother with.


 He was getting a headache. He'd better perform a headache-removing
 spell.


 He retired to the hut the Free'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,
 of course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still
 standing in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big
 black-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint ""woof."" That meant
 headquarters wanted to communicate with him.


 Neeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens
 for focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his
 couch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or
 two he was deep in a cataleptic trance.


 The message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the
 elaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was
 clear enough.


 ""Your report received,"" it boiled down to. ""We are glad to hear that
 you are keeping on with the Free'l. We do not expect you to succeed
 with them—none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever
 has. But if you
should
succeed, by any chance, you would get your
 senior warlock's rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in
 fact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open
 to you.""
Neeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and
 cupidity. His senior warlock's rating—why, he wasn't due to get that
 for nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest
 offices in the Brotherhood—that could mean anything. Anything! He
 hadn't realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the
 Free'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble
 for.


 Neeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists
 pressed against his forehead, and tried to think.


 The Free'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved
 accuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn't want anything.
 That was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He
 had never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free'l express a want.


 Wait, though. There was Rhn.


 He had shown a definite interest in Neeshan's tooter. Something in its
 intricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,
 he hadn't been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to
 extend and develop a magician's spiritual power. He probably thought
 that having it would give him more prestige and influence among his
 people. But for one of the Free'l to say ""I wish I had that"" about
 anything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be
 used as a bribe?


 Neeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A
 tooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician's personality; in
 a sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have
 his tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the
 stakes were enormous.


 Neeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn't want
 to spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.


 Rhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.
 The mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.
 Neeshan came to the point directly.


 ""I'll give you my tooter,"" he said, almost choking over the words, ""if
 you'll do a spell—a simple spell, mind you—exactly right.""


 Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,
 ""Well....""


 Neeshan began his instructions. It wouldn't do for him to help Rhn too
 directly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,
 scratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.


 After Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.
 ""No, don't bother telling me again—it's just more dreeze. Give me the
 materials and I'll show you. Don't forget, you're giving me the tooter
 for this.""
He started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter's hut. While Neeshan
 looked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had
 told him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted
 the order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and
 mispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands
 apart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.


 Neeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. ""Look at that,
 will you!"" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands
 together. ""It worked! I'll take the tooter home with me now.""


 ""The tooter? For
that
? You didn't do the spell right.""


 Rhn stared at him indignantly. ""You mean, you're not going to give me
 the tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,
 really. Neeshan, I think it's very mean of you.""


 ""Try the spell again.""


 ""Oh, dreeze. You're too impatient. You never give anything time to
 work.""


 He got up and walked off.


 For the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They
 all felt sorry for Rhn, who'd worked so hard, done everything he was
 told to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end
 the magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to
 Rhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free'l was
 intolerable.


 But now what was he to do? He'd given up his tooter—he had to ask
 Rhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters—and the
 senior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,
 and all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling
 wretchedly tired out.


 Magic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.
 Neeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable
 than those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for
 help to the magical underworld.


 His thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him
 one thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that
 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the
 most annoying thing they'd encountered in the course of their racial
 history? Good. Fine. Splendid. Then he'd
really
annoy them.


 He'd have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they'd
 turn to magic to get rid of him. They'd have to. And then he'd have
 them. They'd be caught.


 One act of communal magic that really worked and they'd be sold on
 magic. He'd be sure of his senior rating.
Neeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free'l were, there
 was he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical
 objections, and maddening ""wouldn't-it-be-betters.""


 Whereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to
 pointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free'l, he
 now counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,
 from mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until
 they went to bed. He even pursued them with advice
after
they got
 into bed, and told them how to run their sex lives—advice which the
 Free'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,
 resented passionately.


 But most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,
 and instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm—a
 quite simple charm—for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed
 them, work equally well against anything—
or person
—that they found
 annoying.


 The food the Free'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.
 Neeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote
 to poison, around his neck. The Free'l's distaste for him bothered
 him, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the
 anti-annoyance charm to a group of Free'l last night, he had noticed
 that Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn't be much longer now.


 On the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from
 sleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation
 he'd experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,
 and it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.
 Somebody was casting a spell against him.


 At last! At last! It had worked!


 Neeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day
 seemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by
 the spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.


 He began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He
 didn't want the Free'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want
 to have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.
 (He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When
 he was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.


 They were doing it
right
. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his
 chest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind
 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
 the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
 while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
 alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
 when they do their magic dances.


 They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
 him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
 the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.

 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the
 most annoying thing they'd encountered in the course of their racial
 history? Good. Fine. Splendid. Then he'd
really
annoy them.


 He'd have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they'd
 turn to magic to get rid of him. They'd have to. And then he'd have
 them. They'd be caught.


 One act of communal magic that really worked and they'd be sold on
 magic. He'd be sure of his senior rating.
Neeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free'l were, there
 was he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical
 objections, and maddening ""wouldn't-it-be-betters.""


 Whereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to
 pointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free'l, he
 now counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,
 from mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until
 they went to bed. He even pursued them with advice
after
they got
 into bed, and told them how to run their sex lives—advice which the
 Free'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,
 resented passionately.


 But most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,
 and instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm—a
 quite simple charm—for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed
 them, work equally well against anything—
or person
—that they found
 annoying.


 The food the Free'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.
 Neeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote
 to poison, around his neck. The Free'l's distaste for him bothered
 him, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the
 anti-annoyance charm to a group of Free'l last night, he had noticed
 that Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn't be much longer now.


 On the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from
 sleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation
 he'd experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,
 and it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.
 Somebody was casting a spell against him.


 At last! At last! It had worked!


 Neeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day
 seemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by
 the spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.


 He began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He
 didn't want the Free'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want
 to have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.
 (He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When
 he was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.


 They were doing it
right
. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his
 chest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind
 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
 the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
 while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
 alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
 when they do their magic dances.


 They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
 him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
 the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.

39,"THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT
By MARGARET ST. CLAIR
Being a wizard missionary to
 
the Free'l needed more than
 
magic—it called for a miracle!

The spell the Free'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down
 from the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the
 seasons. But, since they had got broor's blood instead of newt's, were
 using alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than
 the solstice anyhow, nothing happened.


 Neeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.


 He'd tried hard with them. The Free'l were really a challenge to
 evangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was
 evinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were
 interested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply
 wouldn't take the trouble to do it right.


 How long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since
 early moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on
 stamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.


 Neeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,
 looked up from his drumming.


 ""Go away,"" he said. ""You'll spoil the charm.""


 ""What charm? Can't you see by now, Rhn, that it isn't going to work?""


 ""Of course it will. It just takes time.""


 ""Hell it will. Hell it does. Watch.""


 Neeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the
 circle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon's
 blood, oil of anointing, and salt.


 He drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon's blood
 at the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with
 the oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,
 which was just coming up, he touched the
outer
cusps with salt. An
 intense smoke sprang up.
When the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in
 the parallelogram.


 ""Tell the demon what you want,"" Neeshan ordered the Free'l.


 The Free'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of
 the things that made teaching them magic difficult.


 ""Two big dyla melons,"" one of the younger ones said at last.


 ""A new andana necklace,"" said another.


 ""A tooter like the one you have,"" said Rhn, who was ambitious.


 ""Straw for a new roof on my hut,"" said one of the older females.


 ""That's enough for now,"" Neeshan interrupted. ""The demon can't bring
 you a tooter, Rhn—you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The
 other things he can get. Sammel, to work!""


 The lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and
 returned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an
 enormous heap of straw.


 ""Can I go now?"" it asked.


 ""Yes."" Neeshan turned to the Free'l, who were sharing the dyla melons
 out around their circle. ""You see?
That's
how it ought to be. You
 cast a spell. You're careful with it. And it works. Right away.""


 ""When you do it, it works,"" Rhn answered.


 ""Magic works when
anybody
does it. But you have to do it right.""


 Rhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. ""It's such a lot
 of dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun."" He walked away,
 munching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.


 Neeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. ""Dreeze"" was a Free'l word that
 referred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race's
 virulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything
 annoying. The Free'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,
 had a lot of colds in the head.


 Wasn't there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest
 spell was too dreezish for them to bother with.


 He was getting a headache. He'd better perform a headache-removing
 spell.


 He retired to the hut the Free'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,
 of course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still
 standing in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big
 black-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint ""woof."" That meant
 headquarters wanted to communicate with him.


 Neeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens
 for focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his
 couch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or
 two he was deep in a cataleptic trance.


 The message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the
 elaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was
 clear enough.


 ""Your report received,"" it boiled down to. ""We are glad to hear that
 you are keeping on with the Free'l. We do not expect you to succeed
 with them—none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever
 has. But if you
should
succeed, by any chance, you would get your
 senior warlock's rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in
 fact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open
 to you.""
Neeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and
 cupidity. His senior warlock's rating—why, he wasn't due to get that
 for nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest
 offices in the Brotherhood—that could mean anything. Anything! He
 hadn't realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the
 Free'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble
 for.


 Neeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists
 pressed against his forehead, and tried to think.


 The Free'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved
 accuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn't want anything.
 That was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He
 had never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free'l express a want.


 Wait, though. There was Rhn.


 He had shown a definite interest in Neeshan's tooter. Something in its
 intricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,
 he hadn't been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to
 extend and develop a magician's spiritual power. He probably thought
 that having it would give him more prestige and influence among his
 people. But for one of the Free'l to say ""I wish I had that"" about
 anything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be
 used as a bribe?


 Neeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A
 tooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician's personality; in
 a sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have
 his tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the
 stakes were enormous.


 Neeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn't want
 to spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.


 Rhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.
 The mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.
 Neeshan came to the point directly.


 ""I'll give you my tooter,"" he said, almost choking over the words, ""if
 you'll do a spell—a simple spell, mind you—exactly right.""


 Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,
 ""Well....""


 Neeshan began his instructions. It wouldn't do for him to help Rhn too
 directly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,
 scratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.


 After Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.
 ""No, don't bother telling me again—it's just more dreeze. Give me the
 materials and I'll show you. Don't forget, you're giving me the tooter
 for this.""
He started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter's hut. While Neeshan
 looked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had
 told him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted
 the order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and
 mispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands
 apart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.


 Neeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. ""Look at that,
 will you!"" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands
 together. ""It worked! I'll take the tooter home with me now.""


 ""The tooter? For
that
? You didn't do the spell right.""


 Rhn stared at him indignantly. ""You mean, you're not going to give me
 the tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,
 really. Neeshan, I think it's very mean of you.""


 ""Try the spell again.""


 ""Oh, dreeze. You're too impatient. You never give anything time to
 work.""


 He got up and walked off.


 For the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They
 all felt sorry for Rhn, who'd worked so hard, done everything he was
 told to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end
 the magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to
 Rhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free'l was
 intolerable.


 But now what was he to do? He'd given up his tooter—he had to ask
 Rhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters—and the
 senior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,
 and all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling
 wretchedly tired out.


 Magic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.
 Neeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable
 than those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for
 help to the magical underworld.


 His thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him
 one thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that
 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the

40,"Going off track
Birmingham's airport isn't like other airports. Right at the north-western end of runway 15 there's a country park and a row of benches. You'll see families picnicking here, enjoying the subsonic spectacle of planes from Brussels, Bucharest and Barcelona roaring just feet overhead on their final approach. Birmingham isn't like other British cities – it fetishises the technical and promotes the new. It is unstinting in its thrall to evolution and unsentimental about erasing past versions of the future in its rush to create new ones; the comprehensive 1960s vision of the city which itself swept away a century's Victoriana is currently being meticulously taken apart concrete slab by concrete slab. The city's motto is 'Forward'. 

 When you get to a certain age you realise how much more visions of the future say about the present they're concocted in than the actual future they purport to show us hurtling towards. A track in the air, sitting on top of concrete legs that couldn't look any more like rational new humans striding into a technocratic promised land if they tried, will always evoke a kind of nostalgia for the 20th century. You think of the SAFEGE monorail depicted in Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of Fahrenheit 451; and of regional news reporters with greasy barnets delivering excited pieces to camera about big plans. 

 Today, on the elevated track that gambols over windswept car parks and threads through cheap motels between Birmingham's airport terminal and the railway station, a simple, ski resort-style people-mover system ferries passengers from plane to train. Three decades ago it was so much more exciting: the world's first commercial maglev, or magnetic levitation, system ran along here.
Opened in 1984, the Birmingham Maglev came at the very tail end of a
trente glorieuses
for British transport technology and, more broadly, European engineering; an era that promised so much yet eventually bequeathed so many relics and ruins. 

 The modernism of the 20th century, expressed especially in architecture and engineering, seemed like nothing less than the founding of a new order. Progress was to be continual, unstoppable and good. Yet today the physical and philosophical advances are being gradually taken apart and retracted, as if we'd woken up sweating and feared we'd somehow overreached ourselves.  

 When the Birmingham Maglev was shuttered in 1995, one of the cars was dumped in a hedge near the A45. Furniture maker and transport enthusiast Andy Jones splashed out a mere £100 for it on eBay in 2011 (although, he says, ""it cost me £400 to get it out of the hedge!""). Now it sits in a field behind Jones's house in Burton Green, a couple of miles east of the airport in the rolling Warwickshire countryside.
I reminisce to Jones about my boyhood excitement for the Birmingham Maglev, about the silly enthusiasm I felt when I got to go on it in the late 80s. He shared the experience. ""I used it in the old days too,"" he says. ""I'd ride backwards and forwards on it, I thought it was smashing."" 

 ""The problem was, it was the end of one lot of technology. The first time it snowed, all hell broke loose! It had a ratcheting mechanism, a primitive form of winch. Beneath that was the hydraulic system. It was lifted up by the magnetic field (under the [car] are steel sheets). But you'd use the hydraulic system to pull it back up on to the system if it broke."" 

 Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the National Rail Museum in York, says: ""British Rail's Derby Research Centre, founded in 1964, was arguably the world's leading rail research facility when it was in full operation. An understanding of the wheel and rail interface comes from there, as does the first tilting train, a new railbus, high-speed freight wagons, computer-controlled interlocking of track and signal, the first successful maglev and many other things."" Gwynne has got the second of the three Birmingham Maglev cars at the museum.
The maglev was a development that spun out of this research at Derby, and developed in a joint project with a private consortium that included the now-defunct General Electric Company. The maglev cars were built by Metro Cammell at its factory four miles from the airport in Washwood Heath. It was the same place many tube carriages came from, and if you look down the doors on Piccadilly line carriages as you get on and off, you can see a cheery 1973 plaque reminding travellers of this fact (the cheeky Brummie assumption here being that London commuters always look at the floor). 

 But the British maglev never really took off. Tim Dunn, transport historian and co-presenter of the BBC's Trainspotting Live, explains why. ""The early 80s was still a time of great British national-funded engineering,"" he says. ""Success at Birmingham Airport would have been a great advert for British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) to sell maglev internationally. (Remember that BREL was always trying to sell its technology overseas, which is why several Pacer trains, developed on bus bodies, were sold to Iran.) Birmingham's Maglev only lasted 11 years: replacement parts were getting hard to obtain for what was really a unique system. Buses took over, and eventually a cable-hauled SkyRail people-mover was installed atop the piers. That's not as exciting for people like me, who like the idea of being whisked in a hovertrain pushed along by magnets. But then our real transport future always has been a pretty crap approximation of our dreams.""
You don't have to look far to find other relics of this white-hot time when post-war confidence begat all sorts of oddities. There's the test track for the French Aerotrain outside Orleans – a rocket-powered prototype that never made it to middle age. And in Emsland, the German conglomerate Transrapid built a 32km supersized test track for their maglev, which seemed to be on course for success. A variation of this train shuttles passengers from Shanghai to the airport, and the plan was to copy the same model in Munich, and even build an intercity line from Berlin to Hamburg. Today the test track stands idle awaiting its fate, while the Transrapid vehicles are up for auction; a museum in Erfurt is trying to save the latter from the scrapyard. Little remains of Germany's other maglev, the M-Bahn (or Magnetbahn), a short-lived shuttle service that ran in West Berlin from 1989-91 connecting stations whose service had been previously severed by the Berlin Wall. With the Wall gone, the old U-Bahn service was reinstated and the M-Bahn, which had run along its tracks, disappeared from the capital of the new Germany. 

 ""The problem with high-speed maglev like Transrapid in Germany,"" says Tim Dunn, ""is that it doesn't really stack up against high-speed rail. It's more expensive, it's lower capacity, it's more complex. There's a gap in the market, but there's no market in the gap. What is needed generally in mass transit is more capacity, rather than super high speed.""
But back in the post-war period, we thought we could have everything. Britain's tertiary science departments expanded. We built the Comet jetliner, then Concorde; and concrete buildings to house them that the world envied, like the huge Heathrow hangar that Sir Owen Williams, primarily an engineer, designed for BOAC's planes; and architect James Stirling's much-lauded engineering faculty at Leicester University. Yet a little-known footnote from this period involves the interaction of magnets in high-speed train design with that other British invention that prevailed for a while but then seemed to peter out: the hovercraft. 

 ""We have always wanted to get rid of wheels,"" says Railworld's Brian Pearce. ""One invention [to this end] was Chris Cockerell's hovercraft."" At the same time, maglev technology was being developed by the British inventor, Eric Laithwaite, who was working on the linear induction motor at Imperial College when he found a way for it to produce lift as well as forward thrust. The two systems were combined to form a tracked hovercraft. ""So along came RTV31,"" says Pearce. ""The train rode along the track on a cushion of air created by big electric fans. Not very energy efficient! The forward motion was created by a linear motor, which moved along rather than going round and round.""
RTV31 could, like France's Aérotrain or the German Transrapid system, have been a viable new form of intercity travel. But funding was insufficient throughout the project and eventually Britain pulled the plug. In February 1973, a week after the first test RTV31 hovertrain reached 157km/h, the project was abandoned as part of wider budget cuts. 

 There's an eerie reminder of the RTV31 in the big-skied, liminal lands of East Anglia. The train was tested on a track that ran up alongside the New Bedford River at Earith in Cambridgeshire: appropriate, because this 'river' is actually a supreme piece of man-made engineering from an earlier age, a dead-straight dyke dug by Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden to drain the fens in the 1600s. The RTV31 test-track piers endure as further reminders of a past future. The vehicle itself sits not far away at Peterborough's Railworld, where its colourful exterior is strikingly visible to today's travellers on the East Coast Main Line from London to Scotland. Its neighbour is the final redundant Birmingham Maglev car.
In the far east, attitudes to maglev are different. Japan began maglev testing at roughly the same time as Britain in 1962 and is today building the longest, fastest maglev in the world. It will run mostly in tunnel, at 500km/h, taking a shocking 40 minutes to travel the 300km between Tokyo and Nagoya. It's been christened the Chūō Shinkansen: just another, faster type of bullet train for the central districts. Japan's system is a superconducting maglev, different to the Birmingham and German systems. It uses superconducting coils in the train, which cause repulsion to move the train forward. The Japanese also use wheels for the vehicle to 'land' on the track at low speeds. 

 It's understandable that most serious interest in maglev deployment is in Asia – Japan, China, India,"" says John Harding, former chief maglev scientist for the US Department of Transportation. ""This is understandable wherever passenger traffic is huge and can dilute the enormous capital cost. (Maglev is indisputably more expensive upfront than high-speed rail.) Even for California, which has huge air passenger traffic between LA and San Francisco, there is nowhere near enough demand to justify maglev; probably not enough to justify high-speed rail. But the Chūō Shinkansen will probably be the greatest success for maglev."" The first link between Tokyo and Nagoya is scheduled to begin operation in 2027. Then the Chinese are proposing a 600km/h system between Shanghai and Beijing.
So there are still some people dreaming big. The latest iteration of this is of course Hyperloop, whose vacuum tube technology harks back to another British engineering innovation: the atmospheric railway, which was developed by Henry Pinkus, the Samuda Brothers and eventually by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. This technology used varying air pressure to suck trains up a track in a partial vacuum. Lines popped up in London, Dublin and most notably Brunel's South Devon Railway, where the pipes were plagued by nibbling rats but the pumping stations survive as relics of Victorian visionaries. If those systems looked like something from HG Wells, with men in top hats smoking cigars, then Hyperloop, with its internet age funding from Tesla founder Elon Musk, could well end up appearing as a very 2010s caper when we look at back on it from the distance of decades. Or maybe Hyperloop will revolutionise travel like maglev was supposed to. 

 Back in Burton Green, Andy Jones's maglev car lies in limbo. ""I'd like to build a platform around it,"" he says, ""turn it into a playhouse for the grandchildren perhaps? A couple of people want to take it away and turn it into a cafe."" Perversely perhaps, its fate may be decided by another type of transport technology: more conventional high speed rail. The route for the much-disputed High Speed 2 line from London to Birmingham slices right through the field where the maglev car sits.  

 In the 2000s the UK Ultraspeed proposal was floated to link London, Birmingham, the North and Scotland by maglev. It never materialised. HS2 was the eventual successor to the Ultraspeed plan, though a less futuristic one. Jones has another idea for his forward moving relic: ""Maybe I'll turn it into viewing platform, so you could watch HS2's outdated technology.""

People act and learn together for a rich mixture of reasons. The current
 story that most of us tell ourselves about how humans get things done is
 focused on the well-known flavors of self-interest, which make for great
 drama−survival, power, wealth, sex, glory. People also do things
 together for fun, for the love of a challenge, and because we sometimes
 enjoy working together to make something beneficial to everybody. If I
 had to reduce the essence of Homo sapiens to five words, “people do
 complicated things together” would do. Online social networks can be
 powerful amplifiers of collective action precisely because they augment
 and extend the power of ever-complexifying human sociality. To be sure,
 gossip, conflict, slander, fraud, greed and bigotry are part of human
 sociality, and those parts of human behavior can be amplified, too. But
 altruism, fun, community and curiosity are also parts of human
 sociality−and I propose that the Web is an existence proof that these
 capabilities can be amplified, as well. Indeed, our species’ social
 inventiveness is central to what it is to be human. The parts of the
 human brain that evolved most recently, and which are connected to what
 we consider to be our “higher” faculties of reason and forethought, are
 also essential to social life. The neural information-processing
 required for recognizing people, remembering their reputations, learning
 the rituals that remove boundaries of mistrust and bind groups together,
 from bands to communities to civilizations, may have been enabled by
 (and may have driven the rapid evolution of) that uniquely human brain
 structure, the neocortex.
But I didn’t start out by thinking about the evolutionary dynamics of
 sociality and the amplification of collective action. Like all of the
 others in this book, I started out by experiencing the new ways of being
 that Internet social media have made possible. And like the other
 Freesouls, Joi Ito has played a catalytic, communitarian,
 Mephistophelian, Pied-Piper-esque, authority-challenging, fun-loving
 role in my experiences of the possibilities of life online.
Friends and Enthusiasts
To me, direct experience of what I later came to call virtual
 communities preceded theories about the ways people
 do things together online. I met Joi Ito in the 1980s as part of what we
 called “the Electronic Networking Association,” a small group of
 enthusiasts who thought that sending black and white text to BBSs with
 1200 baud modems was fun. Joi, like Stewart Brand, was and is what Fred
 Turner calls a network entrepreneur, who
 occupies what Ronald Burt would call key structural roles−what
 Malcolm Gladwell called a connector.  Joi was also a
 believer in going out and doing things and not just talking about it.
Joi was one of the founders of a multicultural BBS in Tokyo, and in the
 early 1990s I had begun to branch out from BBSs and the WELL to
 make connections in many different parts of the world. The fun of
 talking, planning, debating and helping each other online came before
 the notion that our tiny subculture might grow into a worldwide,
 many-to-many, multimedia network of a billion people.  We started to
 dream about future cybersocial possibilities only after personally
 experiencing something new, moving and authentic in our webs of budding
 friendship and collaboration. In recent years, cyberculture studies has
 grown into a discipline−more properly, an interdiscipline involving
 sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, economists,
 programmers and political scientists. Back when people online argued in
 1200 baud text about whether one could properly call what we were doing
 a form of community, there was no body of empirical evidence to serve as
 a foundation for scientific argument−all theory was anecdotal. By now,
 however, there is plenty of data.
One particularly useful affordance of online sociality is that a great
 deal of public behavior is recorded and structured in a way that makes
 it suitable for systematic study. One effect of the digital Panopticon
 is the loss of privacy and the threat of tyrannical social control;
 another effect is a rich body of data about online behavior. Every one
 of Wikipedia’s millions of edits, and all the discussion and talk pages
 associated with those edits, is available for inspection−along with
 billions of Usenet messages. Patterns are beginning to emerge. We’re
 beginning to know something about what works and what doesn’t work with
 people online, and why.
Does knowing something about the way technical architecture influences
 behavior mean that we can put that knowledge to use? Now that we are
 beginning to learn a little about the specific sociotechnical
 affordances of online social networks, is it possible to derive a
 normative design? How should designers think about the principles of
 beneficial social software? Can inhumane or dehumanizing effects of
 digital socializing be mitigated or eliminated by better media design?
 In what ways does the design of social media enable or prevent heartfelt
 communitas, organized collective action, social capital, cultural and
 economic production? I’ve continued to make a direct experience of my
 life online−from lifelong friends like Joi Ito to the other people
 around the world I’ve come to know, because online media made it
 possible to connect with people who shared my interests, even if I had
 never heard of them before, even if they lived on the other side of the
 world. But in parallel with my direct experience of the blogosphere,
 vlogosphere, twitterverse and other realms of digital discourse, I’ve
 continued to track new research and theory about what cyberculture might
 mean and the ways in which online communication media influence and are
 shaped by social forces.
The Values of Volunteers
One of the first questions that arose from my earliest experiences
 online was the question of why people in online communities should spend
 so much time answering each other’s questions, solving each other’s
 problems, without financial compensation. I first encountered Yochai
 Benkler in pursuit of my curiosity about the reason people would work
 together with strangers, without pay, to create something nobody
 owns−free and open source software. First in Coase’s Penguin, and
 then in The Wealth of Networks, Benkler contributed to important
 theoretical foundations for a new way of thinking about online
 activity−”commons based peer production,” technically made possible by a
 billion PCs and Internet connections−as a new form of organizing
 economic production, together with the market and the firm. If Benkler
 is right, the new story about how humans get things done includes an
 important corollary−if tools like the PC and the Internet make it easy
 enough, people are willing to work together for non-market incentives to
 create software, encyclopedias and archives of public domain literature.
 While the old story is that people are highly unlikely to
 cooperate with strangers to voluntarily create public goods, the new
 story seems to be that people will indeed create significant common
 value voluntarily, if it is easy enough for anybody to add what they
 want, whenever they want to add it (“self election”). There is plenty of
 evidence to support the hypothesis that what used to be considered
 altruism is now a byproduct of daily life online. So much of what we
 take for granted as part of daily life online, from the BIND software
 that makes domain names work, to the Apache webserver that powers a
 sizable chunk of the world’s websites, to the cheap Linux servers that
 Google stacks into its global datacloud, was created by volunteers who
 gave their creations away to make possible something larger−the Web as
 we know it.
To some degree, the explosion of creativity that followed the debut of
 the Web in 1993 was made possible by deliberate design decisions on the
 part of the Internet’s architects−the end-to-end principle, built into
 the TCP/IP protocols that make the Internet possible, which deliberately
 decentralizes the power to innovate, to build something new and even
 more powerful on what already exists. Is it possible to understand
 exactly what it is about the web that makes Wikipedia, Linux,
 FightAIDS@Home, the Gutenberg Project and Creative Commons possible? And
 if so, can this theoretical knowledge be put to practical use? I am
 struck by a phrase of Benkler’s from his essay in this book: “We must
 now turn our attention to building systems that support human
 sociality.” That sounds right. But how would it be done? It’s easy to
 say and not as easy to see the ways in which social codes and power
 structures mold the design of communication media. We must develop a
 participative pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics,
 that focuses on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and
 guiding literacies essential to individual and collective life.
A Participative Pedagogy
To accomplish this attention-turning, we must develop a participative
 pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics, that focuses
 on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and guiding
 literacies essential to individual and collective life in the 21st
 century. Literacies are where the human brain, human sociality and
 communication technologies meet. We’re accustomed to thinking about the
 tangible parts of communication media−the devices and networks−but the
 less visible social practices and social affordances, from the alphabet
 to TCP/IP, are where human social genius can meet the augmenting power
 of technological networks. Literacy is the most important method Homo
 sapiens has used to introduce systems and tools to other humans, to
 train each other to partake of and contribute to culture, and to
 humanize the use of instruments that might otherwise enable
 commodification, mechanization and dehumanization. By literacy, I mean,
 following on Neil Postman and others, the set of skills that enable
 individuals to encode and decode knowledge and power via speech,
 writing, printing and collective action, and which, when learned,
 introduce the individual to a community. Literacy links technology and
 sociality. The alphabet did not cause the Roman Empire, but made it
 possible. Printing did not cause democracy or science, but literate
 populations, enabled by the printing press, devised systems for citizen
 governance and collective knowledge creation. The Internet did not cause
 open source production, Wikipedia or emergent collective responses to
 natural disasters, but it made it possible for people to act together in
 new ways, with people they weren’t able to organize action with before,
 in places and at paces for which collective action had never been
 possible. Literacies are the prerequisite for the human agency that used
 alphabets, presses and digital networks to create wealth, alleviate
 suffering and invent new institutions. If the humans currently alive are
 to take advantage of digital technologies to address the most severe
 problems that face our species and the biosphere, computers, telephones
 and digital networks are not enough. We need new literacies around
 participatory media, the dynamics of cooperation and collective action,
 the effective deployment of attention and the relatively rational and
 critical discourse necessary for a healthy public sphere.
Media Literacies
In Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic
 Engagement, I wrote:
If print culture shaped the environment in which the Enlightenment
 blossomed and set the scene for the Industrial Revolution,
 participatory media might similarly shape the cognitive and social
 environments in which twenty first century life will take place (a
 shift in the way our culture operates). For this reason, participatory
 media literacy is not another subject to be shoehorned into the
 curriculum as job training for knowledge workers.
Participatory media include (but aren’t limited to) blogs, wikis, RSS,
 tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups,
 podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network
 services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. These distinctly
 different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:
Many-to-many media now make it possible for every person connected
 to the network to broadcast as well as receive text, images,
 audio, video, software, data, discussions, transactions,
 computations, tags, or links to and from every other person. The
 asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by
 the structure of pre-digital technologies has changed radically.
 This is a technical- structural characteristic.
Participatory media are social media whose value and power derives
 from the active participation of many people. Value derives not
 just from the size of the audience, but from their power to link
 to each other, to form a public as well as a market. This is a
 psychological and social characteristic.
Social networks, when amplified by information and communication
 networks, enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination
 of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.
Like the early days of print, radio, and television, the present
 structure of the participatory media regime−the political, economic,
 social and cultural institutions that constrain and empower the way
 the new medium can be used, and which impose structures on flows of
 information and capital−is still unsettled. As legislative and
 regulatory battles, business competition, and social institutions vie
 to control the new regime, a potentially decisive and presently
 unknown variable is the degree and kind of public participation.
 Because the unique power of the new media regime is precisely its
 participatory potential, the number of people who participate in using
 it during its formative years, and the skill with which they attempt
 to take advantage of this potential, is particularly salient.
Like Yochai Benkler and Henry Jenkins, I believe that a
 participatory culture in which most of the population see themselves as
 creators as well as consumers of culture is far more likely to generate
 freedom and wealth for more people than one in which a small portion of
 the population produces culture that the majority passively consume. The
 technological infrastructure for participatory media has grown rapidly,
 piggybacking on Moore’s Law, globalization, the telecom bubble and the
 innovations of Swiss physicists and computer science
 students. Increasingly, access to that infrastructure−the ability to
 upload a Macaca video or uncover a threat to democracy−has become
 economically accessible. Literacy−access to the codes and communities of
 vernacular video, microblogging, social bookmarking, wiki
 collaboration−is what is required to use that infrastructure to create a
 participatory culture. A population with broadband infrastructure and
 ubiquitous computing could be a captive audience for a cultural
 monopoly, given enough bad laws and judicial rulings. A population that
 knows what to do with the tools at hand stands a better chance of
 resisting enclosure. The more people who know how to use participatory
 media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate and
 organize, the more likely the future infosphere will allow, enable and
 encourage liberty and participation. Such literacy can only make action
 possible, however−it is not in the technology, or even in the knowledge
 of how to use it, but in the ways people use knowledge and technology to
 create wealth, secure freedom, resist tyranny.

Even if your interest in global politics extends no further than an occasional worried glance at the headlines, it will not have escaped your notice that there's something in the air these past few years: a kind of comprehensive, worldwide souring of the possibilities of representative democracy. 

 You might not have thought of it in just these terms, but you'll certainly recognise its effects: it has shown up in phenomena as varied and seemingly disconnected as the Brexit referendum, the candidacy of Donald Trump in the USA and the turn toward authoritarian parties and governments in France, Turkey, Hungary, the Philippines and elsewhere. This is, perhaps, the pre-eminent political story of our time. 

 What all of these more recent developments have in common is the sense among a wide swath of the electorate, in country after country, that the conventional practice of democracy has failed them. It no longer expresses the will of the people, if it ever did, and now serves only the needs of distant, shadowy, unspecified elites. And as is so often the case, there is a grain of truth to this. 

 Our democracies certainly do seem to be having a hard time reckoning with many profound crises, whether these involve the integration of refugees, the disappearance of work or the threats of climate change. Our existing ways of making collective decisions have conspicuously failed to help us develop policies equal to the scale of crisis. There really is a global 1 per cent, and they seem to be hell-bent on having themselves a new Gilded Age, even as the public services the rest of us depend on are stripped to the bone. Throw in the despair that sets in after many years of imposed austerity and it's no wonder that many people have had enough. 

 Some voters, either impervious to the lessons of history, or certain that whatever comes, they'll wind up on top, seek the clarity and vigour of a strong hand. They are perhaps encouraged by authoritarian leaders abroad, with their own internal reasons for disparaging the practice of democracy and much to gain by undermining confidence in it. Other voters have no particular time for the right, but feel betrayed by the parties they once trusted to advance their class interest. When they look around and see that someone other than them is indeed profiting from the status quo, they lose all patience with the idea that redress can be found in the ballot box. They're willing to see their own house burned down, if that's what it takes to stick it to the despised elites that are suddenly, heedlessly gentrifying their neighbourhoods and 'decanting' them from their homes. 

 These are certainly depressing responses to the situation we find ourselves in, but they're not in any way irrational. Yet there's another, more hopeful and interesting way of responding to this same set of facts. It argues that what we need now is more democracy, not less; and a new kind of democracy at that, one founded on technical means. This curious prospect is presented to us by modes of social organisation and self-governance based on the blockchain, the technology underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. And though blockchain advocates are nowhere near as prominent as the neo-authoritarian tendencies everywhere around us, what they are arguing for – 'distributed consensus' – is so interesting and so utterly unlike anything that has gone before that it deserves our fullest and most serious consideration.
We're told that this emerging technology of 'distributed consensus' makes entirely new forms of human association possible; that anyone who wants to will be able to organise themselves into non-hierarchical groups with as much ability to act in the world as any state or corporation.  

 The idea is that governmental structures at just about every level of society would be replaced by voluntary associations represented as software. Participants in these groups could remain anonymous to one another, if desired. But their identities would be verified – and their votes authenticated – by the same processes that secure the Bitcoin network, meaning that a permanent, secure record of every vote ever taken would be available for all to see. As each of these groups would be able to dispose of fiscal resources directly, Porto Alegre-style participatory budgeting could be realised, at whatever scale required. And just like Bitcoin, all of this functionality would be distributed across the network, making it inherently resistant to attempts at state censorship or control.
Enthusiasm for distributed consensus is especially marked on the left, and it's easy to understand why: you'd have a hard time intentionally designing language more likely to appeal to tech-savvy horizontalists than 'distributed consensus'. The phrase summons up images of a society organised as a supple network instead of a hierarchy, its far-flung and mobile constituents bound together by a guiding ethos of participation, and an immaterial but powerful calculated technology.
Thoughtful veterans of the post-2008 moment could be forgiven for thinking that, just maybe, here at last is a concrete way of achieving ends promised but never quite delivered by 15M, Occupy, Nuit Débout, or what has come to be known as the broader global 'movement of the squares': a commons outside the market and the state, a framework for democratic decision-making truly suited to the context of 21st-century life, and just possibly a functioning anarchy. 

 This is certainly a supremely attractive vision, at least for those of us whose hearts beat a little bit faster at the prospect of ordinary people everywhere taking their fate into their own hands. In fact, there's really only one problem with it: it's all based on a misunderstanding.
Let's back up a little. What, exactly, does distributed consensus mean? And what does it have to do with the new forms of democracy that might now be available to us? 

 At a time when 'disruption' and 'disintermediation' remain potent words in the tech community, it was inevitable that someone would think to disrupt the way we organise civic life. Early experiments in digital democracy mostly confined themselves to tinkering in the mechanics of an otherwise conventional political process – working out, for example, how verified electronic voting might work. But more recent proposals, such as the ""distributed autonomous organisations"" pioneered by the Ethereum project, and the structurally similar Backfeed and democracy.earth initiatives, offer far more ambitious ideas of networked citizenship and decision-making. 

 All three are based on the decentralised system of authentication that was originally developed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The details of this mechanism are fiendishly difficult to understand, but its essence – and the innovation that so excites fans of networked democracy – is that it proves the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions computationally, instead of relying on the authority of any government or banking institution. 

 Everything rests on the blockchain, a permanent, transparent record of every exchange of Bitcoin ever made, an identical copy of which is held locally by every machine participating in the network. The blockchain maintains and reconciles all account balances, and is the sole arbiter in the event of a discrepancy or dispute. Whenever a new transaction appears on the Bitcoin network, all of its nodes perform an elaborate series of calculations aimed at validating it, and a majority of them must agree its legitimacy before it can be added to the shared record. This peer-to-peer process of distributed consensus can be applied beyond cryptocurrency to other situations that require some kind of procedure for the collective construction of truth.
One of these is communal decision-making, at every level from household to nation. So by extension distributed consensus could be applied to the practice of democracy. Moreover, frameworks based on the blockchain promise to solve a number of long-standing democratic problems. 

 They give organisers the ability to form associations rapidly and equip them with clear, secure and answerable decision processes. Their provisions allow members of those associations to float proposals, raise points for discussion among their peers, and allow enough time for deliberation before a question is called to a vote. They seem well suited to address some of the limits and frustrations of the Occupy-style forum, chiefly its requirement that everyone sharing an interest be present at once in order to be counted. And by allowing an association to specify any decision rule it pleases – from simple majority to absolute consensus – these frameworks even seem as if they might address the distaste some of us have always harboured for the coercion implicit in any majoritarian process (many don't like the idea that they need to go along with a notion just because 52 per cent of the population voted for it). 

 These systems would appear to be applicable to democracy, then. But more than that, they gesture beyond conventional politics, toward something not far off utopian. 

 When I meet people who are genuinely excited by platforms like democracy.earth, Ethereum and Backfeed, most often what they're responding to is not so much about how these frameworks address the practicalities of small-group decision-making. They're more about the radical, classically anarchist vision they offer of a world in which power is distributed across a federation of nonhierarchical assemblies unsanctioned by any apparatus of state, each one lasting just long enough to enact its participants' will before evaporating for ever. 

 And that's why it's little short of heartbreaking to conclude that their hopes stem from a confusion of language. 

 There's a fair degree of slippage between the way we'd be likely to interpret 'distributed consensus' in a political context, and what the same phrase actually denotes in its proper, technical context. As it turns out, here the word 'consensus' doesn't have anything to do with that sense of common purpose nurtured among a group of people over the course of long and difficult negotiations. Rather, it is technical jargon: it simply refers to the process by which all of the computers participating in the Bitcoin network eventually come to agree that a given transaction is valid. Instead of being a technically mediated process of agreement among peers and equals separated from one another in space and time, it's actually just a reconciliation of calculations being performed by distant machines.  

 To mistake the one for the other is to commit a dangerous error.
Why dangerous? One of the primary risks we face in embracing blockchain-based structures is that we may not actually be advancing the set of values we think we are. The provisions that frameworks like Ethereum, Backfeed and democracy.earth are founded on, in particular, are difficult to reconcile with other values and commitments we may hold, especially the notion of a life in common.  

 An Ethereum distributed autonomous organisation, for example, requires that members buy shares in it in order to participate. This is necessitated by the reward structure that incentivises machines to perform the calculations that establish distributed consensus; but it seems curiously at odds with our understanding of political participation as an inalienable right. Ethereum democracies, too, have something most others do not: owners, someone empowered to add or remove voting members at will, set its binding decision rules, and change those rules whenever they desire. 

 This is certainly a novel and interesting definition of a democracy. In fact, we find, on looking just a little more closely, that relations of property and ownership are absolutely central to this set of technologies – perhaps unsurprisingly, given its origins in the libertarian cryptocurrency community. This, for example, is how Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin thinks of human association: 

 ""In general, a human organisation can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals, which may or may not be divided into certain classes with different conditions for entering or leaving the set, to interact with each other including rules for under what circumstances the individuals may use certain parts of the property."" 

 On closer inspection, this doesn't seem to have much to do with the practice of collective self-determination. And with a similar emphasis on property rights, the discourse around the blockchain also routinely treats as uncontroversial statements which are no such thing. The acceptance of these values runs so deep that when democracy.earth announced itself ""a Y Combinator-backed organisation"", nobody involved evidently wondered whether something which aspired to be a radical new way of doing politics should tout its backing by a venture-capital seed fund based in Silicon Valley. 

 However utopian a politics of distributed consensus might sound to us, then, there's no way in which it can be prised apart from the entirely conventional constructions of ownership, private property and capital accumulation at its very heart, at least not in its present form. The profoundly murky quality of blockchain technology – and the relative lack of accessible but technically sophisticated resources that might explain it – thus causes some of us to endorse a set of propositions we'd otherwise recoil from. We criticise lack of government transparency, yet the blockchain is unfathomable to most people. 

 Finally, too many of those touting distributed democracy retain a weirdly naive faith in the promises made about the blockchain's ability to transcend human fallibility, despite the well-known history of Bitcoin hacks, thefts and exploits. The founders of democracy.earth, for example, would have us believe that the blockchain is 'incorruptible', when, as all long-time observers of the cryptocurrency scene know, it's anything but. There is no better case in point than Ethereum's own networked democracy, a distributed venture fund rather confusingly called the DAO – Decentralised Autonomous Organisation – which was notoriously drained of a full third of its value by someone who evidently understood its coding better than its own originators. The Ethereum blockchain was subsequently 'hard forked' to undo this exploit, but only at the cost of angering that passionate fraction of their community convinced that distributed calculation could achieve what millennia of human law and custom had not. 

 Though they may someday be robust enough to undergird decisions of genuine import, the experience of the DAO suggests that blockchain-based protocols are at present no more trustworthy than any of the less glamorous methods for assessing communal sentiment we already have at our disposal: the assembly, the discussion and the poll.
There's a long list of benefits that might follow from shifting civic life on to a networked platform. 

 If people could participate in public life from their laptop (or smartphone, or gaming platform), we might be able to democratise democracy itself, in all sorts of salutary ways. We might fold in all those who, by dint of their work, childcare or family obligations, are too exhausted or pressed for time to attend a decision-making assembly, and prevent the common circumstance in which such an assembly is captured by a bad-faith participant with an axe to grind. We could avoid having to gather stakeholders in a given place and time to make decisions of common import, and allow people to participate in public life as and when they were able to. And we could apply to that participation all the tools that arise from being networked and digital, particularly the ability to capture and analyse detailed data about a matter up for discussion.  

 Under such circumstances, decisions could be compared between polities and jurisdictions, or with ones made locally in the past, and every aspect of a community's process of self-determination could be searchable, so available to all who might benefit. Over time, we might even learn to make wiser decisions, individually and collectively. Though the devil is always in the detail of implementation, these possibilities are all well worth exploring; and taken together they certainly furnish us with a strong case for networked democracy. 

 But there are problems even with such relatively simple articulations of civic technology. Not everyone owns a smartphone, even now, let alone any more expensive networked devices. Just over 60 per cent of North Americans do, which falls far short of the universal access on which any system for networked democracy would need to be based. And technologists and advocates for new technology are often blind to the digital divide, which prevents measures that seem utterly obvious and self-evident to them from being at all suited to the lives of others. 

 Transplanting democracy on to the blockchain is more problematic still, especially for those of us who aspire to a life broadly governed by the principles of the commons. When we dig beneath appealing-sounding buzzwords like 'peer-to-peer' and 'open source', we find that all of the current, real-world examples of blockchain technology commit us to a set of values that isn't merely at variance with those principles, but is outright inimical to them. (Our ignorance about how the blockchain actually works is an additional source of concern. When something is this complicated, this difficult for even very bright people to understand, it's inherently open to the greatest potential for abuse. The market in derivative securities comes to mind.) 

 But maybe these are errors we can learn from. It's worth asking if some of the things the blockchain-based frameworks promise to do for us might be lifted whole out of the matrix of their origins.  

 They get a lot of things very right, after all – particularly their understanding that democracy is an ongoing process, and not something that happens in a voting booth on one day every four or five years. And by framing the practice of active citizenship as something appropriate to every scale of collective existence, they suggest that such participation should occupy a larger place in our civic lives; that we can and should assume control over a wider range of the circumstances of our being. 

 By the same token, democratic practice is a subtle thing. It is possible to do a great deal of damage by applying it without due regard for its strengths and limitations – witness Brexit. So perhaps the most important thing we might seek to gain from our encounter with tools like Backfeed and democracy.earth is a lesson in what works at what scale and what doesn't. We could then design a generation of distributed collective decision processes that are straightforward enough to be understood by the people using them, and not beholden to profoundly interested notions of private advantage. Developing an infrastructure built from the ground up would be a great way of redeeming the hope that's already been invested in these systems, and it might even convince those who have become disillusioned with democracy that there's more life in the concept yet. Maybe it's time we got started.

 What all of these more recent developments have in common is the sense among a wide swath of the electorate, in country after country, that the conventional practice of democracy has failed them. It no longer expresses the will of the people, if it ever did, and now serves only the needs of distant, shadowy, unspecified elites. And as is so often the case, there is a grain of truth to this. 

 Our democracies certainly do seem to be having a hard time reckoning with many profound crises, whether these involve the integration of refugees, the disappearance of work or the threats of climate change. Our existing ways of making collective decisions have conspicuously failed to help us develop policies equal to the scale of crisis. There really is a global 1 per cent, and they seem to be hell-bent on having themselves a new Gilded Age, even as the public services the rest of us depend on are stripped to the bone. Throw in the despair that sets in after many years of imposed austerity and it's no wonder that many people have had enough. 

 Some voters, either impervious to the lessons of history, or certain that whatever comes, they'll wind up on top, seek the clarity and vigour of a strong hand. They are perhaps encouraged by authoritarian leaders abroad, with their own internal reasons for disparaging the practice of democracy and much to gain by undermining confidence in it. Other voters have no particular time for the right, but feel betrayed by the parties they once trusted to advance their class interest. When they look around and see that someone other than them is indeed profiting from the status quo, they lose all patience with the idea that redress can be found in the ballot box. They're willing to see their own house burned down, if that's what it takes to stick it to the despised elites that are suddenly, heedlessly gentrifying their neighbourhoods and 'decanting' them from their homes. 

 These are certainly depressing responses to the situation we find ourselves in, but they're not in any way irrational. Yet there's another, more hopeful and interesting way of responding to this same set of facts. It argues that what we need now is more democracy, not less; and a new kind of democracy at that, one founded on technical means. This curious prospect is presented to us by modes of social organisation and self-governance based on the blockchain, the technology underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. And though blockchain advocates are nowhere near as prominent as the neo-authoritarian tendencies everywhere around us, what they are arguing for – 'distributed consensus' – is so interesting and so utterly unlike anything that has gone before that it deserves our fullest and most serious consideration.
We're told that this emerging technology of 'distributed consensus' makes entirely new forms of human association possible; that anyone who wants to will be able to organise themselves into non-hierarchical groups with as much ability to act in the world as any state or corporation.  

 The idea is that governmental structures at just about every level of society would be replaced by voluntary associations represented as software. Participants in these groups could remain anonymous to one another, if desired. But their identities would be verified – and their votes authenticated – by the same processes that secure the Bitcoin network, meaning that a permanent, secure record of every vote ever taken would be available for all to see. As each of these groups would be able to dispose of fiscal resources directly, Porto Alegre-style participatory budgeting could be realised, at whatever scale required. And just like Bitcoin, all of this functionality would be distributed across the network, making it inherently resistant to attempts at state censorship or control.
Enthusiasm for distributed consensus is especially marked on the left, and it's easy to understand why: you'd have a hard time intentionally designing language more likely to appeal to tech-savvy horizontalists than 'distributed consensus'. The phrase summons up images of a society organised as a supple network instead of a hierarchy, its far-flung and mobile constituents bound together by a guiding ethos of participation, and an immaterial but powerful calculated technology.
Thoughtful veterans of the post-2008 moment could be forgiven for thinking that, just maybe, here at last is a concrete way of achieving ends promised but never quite delivered by 15M, Occupy, Nuit Débout, or what has come to be known as the broader global 'movement of the squares': a commons outside the market and the state, a framework for democratic decision-making truly suited to the context of 21st-century life, and just possibly a functioning anarchy. 

 This is certainly a supremely attractive vision, at least for those of us whose hearts beat a little bit faster at the prospect of ordinary people everywhere taking their fate into their own hands. In fact, there's really only one problem with it: it's all based on a misunderstanding.
Let's back up a little. What, exactly, does distributed consensus mean? And what does it have to do with the new forms of democracy that might now be available to us? 

 At a time when 'disruption' and 'disintermediation' remain potent words in the tech community, it was inevitable that someone would think to disrupt the way we organise civic life. Early experiments in digital democracy mostly confined themselves to tinkering in the mechanics of an otherwise conventional political process – working out, for example, how verified electronic voting might work. But more recent proposals, such as the ""distributed autonomous organisations"" pioneered by the Ethereum project, and the structurally similar Backfeed and democracy.earth initiatives, offer far more ambitious ideas of networked citizenship and decision-making. 

 All three are based on the decentralised system of authentication that was originally developed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The details of this mechanism are fiendishly difficult to understand, but its essence – and the innovation that so excites fans of networked democracy – is that it proves the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions computationally, instead of relying on the authority of any government or banking institution. 

 Everything rests on the blockchain, a permanent, transparent record of every exchange of Bitcoin ever made, an identical copy of which is held locally by every machine participating in the network. The blockchain maintains and reconciles all account balances, and is the sole arbiter in the event of a discrepancy or dispute. Whenever a new transaction appears on the Bitcoin network, all of its nodes perform an elaborate series of calculations aimed at validating it, and a majority of them must agree its legitimacy before it can be added to the shared record. This peer-to-peer process of distributed consensus can be applied beyond cryptocurrency to other situations that require some kind of procedure for the collective construction of truth.
One of these is communal decision-making, at every level from household to nation. So by extension distributed consensus could be applied to the practice of democracy. Moreover, frameworks based on the blockchain promise to solve a number of long-standing democratic problems. 

 They give organisers the ability to form associations rapidly and equip them with clear, secure and answerable decision processes. Their provisions allow members of those associations to float proposals, raise points for discussion among their peers, and allow enough time for deliberation before a question is called to a vote. They seem well suited to address some of the limits and frustrations of the Occupy-style forum, chiefly its requirement that everyone sharing an interest be present at once in order to be counted. And by allowing an association to specify any decision rule it pleases – from simple majority to absolute consensus – these frameworks even seem as if they might address the distaste some of us have always harboured for the coercion implicit in any majoritarian process (many don't like the idea that they need to go along with a notion just because 52 per cent of the population voted for it). 

 These systems would appear to be applicable to democracy, then. But more than that, they gesture beyond conventional politics, toward something not far off utopian. 

 When I meet people who are genuinely excited by platforms like democracy.earth, Ethereum and Backfeed, most often what they're responding to is not so much about how these frameworks address the practicalities of small-group decision-making. They're more about the radical, classically anarchist vision they offer of a world in which power is distributed across a federation of nonhierarchical assemblies unsanctioned by any apparatus of state, each one lasting just long enough to enact its participants' will before evaporating for ever. 

 And that's why it's little short of heartbreaking to conclude that their hopes stem from a confusion of language. 

 There's a fair degree of slippage between the way we'd be likely to interpret 'distributed consensus' in a political context, and what the same phrase actually denotes in its proper, technical context. As it turns out, here the word 'consensus' doesn't have anything to do with that sense of common purpose nurtured among a group of people over the course of long and difficult negotiations. Rather, it is technical jargon: it simply refers to the process by which all of the computers participating in the Bitcoin network eventually come to agree that a given transaction is valid. Instead of being a technically mediated process of agreement among peers and equals separated from one another in space and time, it's actually just a reconciliation of calculations being performed by distant machines.  

 To mistake the one for the other is to commit a dangerous error.
Why dangerous? One of the primary risks we face in embracing blockchain-based structures is that we may not actually be advancing the set of values we think we are. The provisions that frameworks like Ethereum, Backfeed and democracy.earth are founded on, in particular, are difficult to reconcile with other values and commitments we may hold, especially the notion of a life in common.  

 An Ethereum distributed autonomous organisation, for example, requires that members buy shares in it in order to participate. This is necessitated by the reward structure that incentivises machines to perform the calculations that establish distributed consensus; but it seems curiously at odds with our understanding of political participation as an inalienable right. Ethereum democracies, too, have something most others do not: owners, someone empowered to add or remove voting members at will, set its binding decision rules, and change those rules whenever they desire. 

 This is certainly a novel and interesting definition of a democracy. In fact, we find, on looking just a little more closely, that relations of property and ownership are absolutely central to this set of technologies – perhaps unsurprisingly, given its origins in the libertarian cryptocurrency community. This, for example, is how Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin thinks of human association: 

 ""In general, a human organisation can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals, which may or may not be divided into certain classes with different conditions for entering or leaving the set, to interact with each other including rules for under what circumstances the individuals may use certain parts of the property."" 

 On closer inspection, this doesn't seem to have much to do with the practice of collective self-determination. And with a similar emphasis on property rights, the discourse around the blockchain also routinely treats as uncontroversial statements which are no such thing. The acceptance of these values runs so deep that when democracy.earth announced itself ""a Y Combinator-backed organisation"", nobody involved evidently wondered whether something which aspired to be a radical new way of doing politics should tout its backing by a venture-capital seed fund based in Silicon Valley. 

 However utopian a politics of distributed consensus might sound to us, then, there's no way in which it can be prised apart from the entirely conventional constructions of ownership, private property and capital accumulation at its very heart, at least not in its present form. The profoundly murky quality of blockchain technology – and the relative lack of accessible but technically sophisticated resources that might explain it – thus causes some of us to endorse a set of propositions we'd otherwise recoil from. We criticise lack of government transparency, yet the blockchain is unfathomable to most people. 

 Finally, too many of those touting distributed democracy retain a weirdly naive faith in the promises made about the blockchain's ability to transcend human fallibility, despite the well-known history of Bitcoin hacks, thefts and exploits. The founders of democracy.earth, for example, would have us believe that the blockchain is 'incorruptible', when, as all long-time observers of the cryptocurrency scene know, it's anything but. There is no better case in point than Ethereum's own networked democracy, a distributed venture fund rather confusingly called the DAO – Decentralised Autonomous Organisation – which was notoriously drained of a full third of its value by someone who evidently understood its coding better than its own originators. The Ethereum blockchain was subsequently 'hard forked' to undo this exploit, but only at the cost of angering that passionate fraction of their community convinced that distributed calculation could achieve what millennia of human law and custom had not. 

 Though they may someday be robust enough to undergird decisions of genuine import, the experience of the DAO suggests that blockchain-based protocols are at present no more trustworthy than any of the less glamorous methods for assessing communal sentiment we already have at our disposal: the assembly, the discussion and the poll.
There's a long list of benefits that might follow from shifting civic life on to a networked platform. 

 If people could participate in public life from their laptop (or smartphone, or gaming platform), we might be able to democratise democracy itself, in all sorts of salutary ways. We might fold in all those who, by dint of their work, childcare or family obligations, are too exhausted or pressed for time to attend a decision-making assembly, and prevent the common circumstance in which such an assembly is captured by a bad-faith participant with an axe to grind. We could avoid having to gather stakeholders in a given place and time to make decisions of common import, and allow people to participate in public life as and when they were able to. And we could apply to that participation all the tools that arise from being networked and digital, particularly the ability to capture and analyse detailed data about a matter up for discussion.  

 Under such circumstances, decisions could be compared between polities and jurisdictions, or with ones made locally in the past, and every aspect of a community's process of self-determination could be searchable, so available to all who might benefit. Over time, we might even learn to make wiser decisions, individually and collectively. Though the devil is always in the detail of implementation, these possibilities are all well worth exploring; and taken together they certainly furnish us with a strong case for networked democracy. 

 But there are problems even with such relatively simple articulations of civic technology. Not everyone owns a smartphone, even now, let alone any more expensive networked devices. Just over 60 per cent of North Americans do, which falls far short of the universal access on which any system for networked democracy would need to be based. And technologists and advocates for new technology are often blind to the digital divide, which prevents measures that seem utterly obvious and self-evident to them from being at all suited to the lives of others. 

 Transplanting democracy on to the blockchain is more problematic still, especially for those of us who aspire to a life broadly governed by the principles of the commons. When we dig beneath appealing-sounding buzzwords like 'peer-to-peer' and 'open source', we find that all of the current, real-world examples of blockchain technology commit us to a set of values that isn't merely at variance with those principles, but is outright inimical to them. (Our ignorance about how the blockchain actually works is an additional source of concern. When something is this complicated, this difficult for even very bright people to understand, it's inherently open to the greatest potential for abuse. The market in derivative securities comes to mind.) 

 But maybe these are errors we can learn from. It's worth asking if some of the things the blockchain-based frameworks promise to do for us might be lifted whole out of the matrix of their origins.  

 They get a lot of things very right, after all – particularly their understanding that democracy is an ongoing process, and not something that happens in a voting booth on one day every four or five years. And by framing the practice of active citizenship as something appropriate to every scale of collective existence, they suggest that such participation should occupy a larger place in our civic lives; that we can and should assume control over a wider range of the circumstances of our being. 

 By the same token, democratic practice is a subtle thing. It is possible to do a great deal of damage by applying it without due regard for its strengths and limitations – witness Brexit. So perhaps the most important thing we might seek to gain from our encounter with tools like Backfeed and democracy.earth is a lesson in what works at what scale and what doesn't. We could then design a generation of distributed collective decision processes that are straightforward enough to be understood by the people using them, and not beholden to profoundly interested notions of private advantage. Developing an infrastructure built from the ground up would be a great way of redeeming the hope that's already been invested in these systems, and it might even convince those who have become disillusioned with democracy that there's more life in the concept yet. Maybe it's time we got started.

43,"Women on the march
In the last weekend of November, Sophie Walker took to the stage at the Women's Equality Party's first conference to make her leader's speech and, within a few minutes, began weeping. She cried as she recounted the difficulties of being a single parent trying to access services for her autistic daughter: ""Finding out that no one was interested, no one cared, no one welcomed her as person who lived differently."" 

 This wasn't just a stray tear, brushed away. Walker (pictured above) seemed to be struggling to go on. The conference held its breath. I gripped the sides of my chair in a mixture of sympathy and embarrassment, thinking this wasn't going to go down well in the media, that she would be mocked for feebleness; what kind of leader, faced with an audience of hundreds, stands in front of them and cries at life's defeats? 

 It was only afterwards that it occurred to me that this had been one of the most significant, and, yes, persuasive moments of the entire event. Walker could hardly have made her point – that her daughter's diagnosis had punctured her own privilege as a white, university-educated journalist (and tall and beautiful, which she did not say but which is nevertheless probably relevant) – more tellingly. Her tears powerfully conveyed her devastation at feeling her child was destined, as she put it, either to be invisible or to be exposed, and the helplessness this induced.
The Women's Equality party conference was awash with talk about women 'doing politics differently'. The phrase was trotted out repeatedly, although it wasn't entirely clear what it actually meant. This week, as hundreds of thousands of women prepare to march on Washington on Saturday following the inauguration of Donald Trump (with marches in 200 other US cities and more than 50 others worldwide, including across the UK and in London, where Sophie Walker will be one of the speakers) this seems a good moment to try to pin down whether there is anything new about 21st-century women's activism and, if so, what it is. 

 There are two ways in which women might potentially 'do politics differently': policy, and practice. As far as the former is concerned, the Women's Equality party is promoting broad areas of policy capable of attracting women from across the traditional political spectrum, including closing the gender pay gap, subsidising childcare, ending violence against women, and equal representation in business, politics and the media. Detail and delivery would be more fraught, but, for now, these are things most women can get behind. Both Nicky Morgan, former Conservative Education Secretary, and Sal Brinton, President of the Liberal Democrats, spoke at the conference. 

 It is in its practice, though, that women's activism has real potential to enlarge our understanding of what it means to be political. 

 Among the variety of reasons for Brexit and Trump, rage was right up there. Emotion is back in fashion. The Brexiters and Trump eschewed rational arguments in favour of pleas to feeling. Trump is President of Emotions. (Sad!) Yet we are ill-equipped to understand this outbreak of feeling, as Pankaj Mishra argues in his forthcoming book, The Age of Anger, because our dominant intellectual concepts are incapable of comprehending the role of emotion in politics. 

 Since the Enlightenment, Mishra argues, our political thinking has been ever more tightly gripped by materialist, mechanistic premises – for example by the idea that ""humans are essentially rational and motivated by the pursuit of their own interests; that they principally act to maximise personal happiness, rather than on the basis of fear, anger and resentment.""
Homo economicus
, he says, ""views the market as the ideal form of human interaction and venerates technological progress and the growth of GDP. All of this is part of the rigid contemporary belief that what counts is only what can be counted and that what cannot be counted – subjective emotions – therefore does not."" There is no room in this world view for more complex motivations: vanity, say, or the fear of humiliation.
How, then, to comprehend, let alone articulate, the vulnerability, the shame, the loss of identity created by inequality, job losses and purposeless communities? The roiling emotions engendered by capitalism's failure to confer the promised general prosperity cannot be understood when emotion is a thing men are meant to contain, then repudiate. Strongmen leaders do not stand in front of their political parties and weep about their daughters. That sort of thing is for losers. Male valour is about not showing emotional distress. (This is very deeply embedded in our culture: ""Thy tears are womanish,"" Shakespeare's Friar Lawrence scolds Romeo, although Romeo has every right to be upset, because he has just killed a man, who was Juliet's cousin.)
Emotion is stigmatised as belonging to lesser, non-normative groups. Women are hysterical. Black men are hypersexual. Homosexuals are unreliably camp. There is no option for the would-be winners, competing to maximise their self-interest, to respond to injury by saying,  ""Please, that's painful!"" – still less by weeping. 

 The emotion is there, nevertheless, metastasising. Since men without the means to express vulnerability cannot mourn frankly their loss of identity as a provider (let alone their disorientation when other groups threaten to undermine their unearned sense of superiority), injured masculinity must disguise itself in images of strength, mastery, honour. Trump himself is a personification of this phenomenon, as Laurie Penny has observed: ""At once an emblem of violent, impenetrable masculinity – the nasally-rigid, iron-hearted business Svengali determined to slap America until it stops snivelling – and a byword for hysterical sensitivity, a wailing man-baby with a hair-trigger temper.""
All this emotion-with-nowhere-to-go was seized on by the Trump and Brexit campaigns. They found a way to channel it, allowing electorates to associate themselves with winning, to bray 'losers' at people they didn't like. It turned out not to matter very much what they were winning at or where it took them. Getting Trump into the White House, like Brexit, was an end in itself, a way of displacing pain, therapeutic. 

 It was also deeply reactionary. The hideous inequalities of global capitalism being what they are, it is hard for the 99 per cent to conceive of themselves becoming winners as things stand – so Trump and Brexit offered instead a return to fantasies of the past. The iconography of Brexit has its roots in Britain's resistance to the Nazis (conveniently overlooking small things like imperial reach and American intervention), while the Trump campaign's ""make America great again"" offered still more explicit nostalgia for a time when the nation had a common destiny, with white men front and centre. 

 What women's activism might bring to politics is a different sensibility, one that acknowledges that emotions are inevitable, messy – and necessary. There is a hole in politics where opposition used to be and social democracy used to flourish. That is largely because rational arguments, facts, expertise, seem to bear too little relation to the way that many people feel about the world. The liberals' arguments seem to be conducted in a kind of parallel universe, of interest only to those who thrive there. When called to articulate a vision for Britain in Europe, the best Remainers could manage was an abstract account of financial penalties if the electorate didn't do as it was told – which, since it never connected, was easily dismissed as 'Project Fear'. 

 People have not, in fact, lost interest in truth. But first and foremost, they know the truth of their emotional relationship to the world. Liberals and social democrats currently have no way of addressing this. A lot of the time, they appear to be talking gobbledygook. 

 The populist right has found an emotive way to engage electorates by channelling their feelings, often displacing them onto someone else in the process. If you cannot look at yourself in the mirror – because anxiousness makes you feel weak and to be weak is to be a failed human being – you are prey to finding someone else to blame for your loss of dignity. In a world of competition, the only way to self-esteem is to be a winner. And someone else must therefore become the loser.
There is an alternative: a politics that begins with the notion that emotions do not have to be repressed or deformed into bigotry and abuse. An understanding of feelings that does not equate weakness with shame, and compassion with maladaptive weakness, is much more likely to suggest solutions than one that denies our emotional lives, most of what makes us human.
When people admit to their emotions, they call for empathy; they can galvanise action. ""And the government's name for a single mother raising two children and caring for her elderly father?"" Sophie Walker asked, in her conference speech, promptly supplying the (clearly absurd) answer: 'Economically inactive'. Walker's single mother is of no importance in the Trump/Farage fantasy land of winning, greatness, the deal, othering the outsider. The unpaid work of caring is about love; it entails vulnerability, which immediately makes it suspect in a world of winning and losing, in which the only permissible emotions are triumph and mocking schadenfreude. 

 The prevailing political mood of the moment is anxiety. ""To live a modern life anywhere in the world today,"" Mark Lilla wrote recently in the New York Times, ""subject to perpetual social and technological transformation, is to experience the psychological equivalent of permanent revolution. Anxiety in the face of this process is now a universal experience, which is why reactionary ideas attract adherents around the world who share little except their sense of historical betrayal."" 

 When liberals make pious noises about understanding the anxiety of constituents who have turned away from them, their solution often seems to entail taking on some of the bigotry. You don't have to look very far to find those who believe that feminism is inadequate to the task of humanising politics because it is, in fact, part of the problem. Lilla, in another piece in the New York Times, and Simon Jenkins, in the Guardian, have each argued that the policing of language and behaviour – which some call courtesy – has provoked a backlash and so must bear some of the blame for populism. The logical extension of this argument is that feminists, along with Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ activists and other assorted 'snowflakes', need to take a step back and think about just how much damage they're doing.
The problem is that this assumes white men's lives are neutral territory around which the common interest can coalesce. It is, in other words, male identity politics. ""There has been a massive backlash by white men,"" Sophie Walker told me, at the WE party headquarters in Bermondsey, a few weeks after the conference speech. ""We are living out the identity politics of the straight white man right now."" 

 If we are not to face a breakdown to essentialist tribal identities of gender and race, people have to find a way of articulating feelings of distress in a way that doesn't humiliate them. If men cannot face their anxiety, it will be denied, and then absolutely nothing will be done to alleviate it; there will be a privatisation of misery. There are structural reasons for the explosion of mental health disorders in advanced economies, for the opiate addiction in the rustbelt, the epidemic of distress among young people, other sorts of self-harm. But if we can't acknowledge the underlying dread and helplessness that people experience in the face of a world controlled by global finance capital and incomprehensible algorithms, individuals will continue to be stigmatised as failing. Either you will be a winner, an entrepreneurial individual competing freely in the market, deflecting your distress by manning up, lashing out; or your inchoate feelings of desperation will be – sorry – your problem, mate. 

 A female sensibility in politics is not, it probably needs saying, antithetical to reason, even though feeling and reason are often posited as opposites. Plato contrasted the wild horse of passion and the wise charioteer of reason (his point being, of course, that they needed each other). Jane Austen would have had no plots without the frequent difficulty human beings have in accommodating desire and wisdom: success, as she repeatedly shows, lies in the reconciliation of sense and sensibility. Such an accommodation requires self-examination, generosity of spirit, fidelity to self, and hard thinking. But first and foremost, it takes an honesty about feeling. 

 I used to get mildly irritated when feminists focused too hard on female representation, when there seemed so many other pressing things to talk about, as if vaginas alone made a difference. And it is true that there is a glass-ceiling feminism that takes little heed of women for whom race, class, disability and/or sexuality intersect to intensify and redouble gender discrimination. But sheer numbers of women do make a difference. Nicky Morgan notes that women in parliament are more inclined to collaborate across party than men. Sal Brinton, who has had a lifetime of being a lone woman on decision-making bodies, says that when women get to 40 per cent in a meeting or on a board, the language changes. There's a different way of conducting business, a different sense of how to move things on. In a hall overwhelmingly dominated by women, it is possible for a leader to cry and everyone to be on her side. For no one to think (after a moment of adjustment from unreconstructed be-more-like-a-man feminists like me) that you're weak. 

 Over the coming months and years, progressives are going to have to grapple with what kind of emotional appeal they can make beyond the populists' exploitative deformation of feeling. The task will be to retrieve emotion from its current co-option into a minatory, ultimately self-defeating way of looking at the world.  

 Women are not (of course) alone in identifying the need for soul in politics. Robert Musil and Stephen Toulmin, among others, have identified that there was a highly rationalistic and scientific turn in Enlightenment thinking after Descartes and Newton. Had the Enlightenment developed instead out of the vision of Montaigne, or Shakespeare, the thinking goes, it would have made more room for kindness, and would have given us a fuller, more complex and nuanced account of human experience. In the current destabilised times, people are returning to their ideas. 

 Perhaps women's activism can give us all a way into reconnecting with a different, more generous apprehension of the Enlightenment. By caring about caring, for example – not as an abstract problem that acts as a brake on the economy, but because caring is about love, family, community, humanity. By reminding men that it is possible to acknowledge pain and survive, and then get stronger. As the political ground shifts under our feet and old allegiances and responses turn out to be no use to us, we are going to need to find a different language of politics. And the language of women is where we should start.

44,"Open Access: Casualties
Will a general shift to OA leave casualties?
                                         
                                          For example, will rising levels of green OA trigger cancellations of toll-access journals?
This question matters for those publishers (not all publishers) who fear the answer is yes and for those activists (not all activists) who hope the answer is yes. So far, unfortunately, it doesn’t have a simple yes-or-no answer, and most discussions replace evidence with fearful or hopeful predictions.
The primary drivers of green OA are policies at universities and funding agencies. Remember, all university policies allow publishers to protect themselves at will. (See section 4.1 on policies.) For example, universities with loophole or deposit mandates will not provide green OA when publishers do not allow it. Universities with Harvard-style rights-retention mandates will not provide OA when authors obtain waivers or when publishers require authors to obtain waivers as a condition of publication.
Hence, publishers who worry about the effect of university OA policies on subscriptions have the remedy in their own hands. Faculty needn’t paternalize publishers by voting down OA policies when publishers can protect themselves whenever they see the need to do so. The experience at Harvard since February 2008 is that very few publishers see the need to do so. Fewer than a handful systematically require waivers from Harvard authors.
This chapter, then, focuses on the strongest green OA mandates at funding agencies, like the Wellcome Trust and NIH, which allow no opt-outs for publishers or grantees. Will strong green OA policies of that kind trigger cancellations of toll-access journals? Here are 10 parts of any complete answer.
1. Nobody knows yet how green OA policies will affect journal subscriptions.
Rising levels of green OA may trigger toll-access journal cancellations, or they may not. So far they haven’t.
2. The evidence from physics is the most relevant.
Physics has the highest levels and longest history of green OA. The evidence from physics to date is that high levels of green OA don’t cause journal cancellations. On the contrary, the relationship between arXiv (the OA repository for physics) and toll-access physics journals is more symbiotic than antagonistic.
Physicists have been self-archiving since 1991, far longer than in any other field. In some subfields, such as particle physics, the rate of OA archiving approaches 100 percent, far higher than in any other field. If high-volume green OA caused journal cancellations, we’d see the effect first in physics. But it hasn’t happened. Two leading publishers of physics journals, the American Physical Society (APS) and Institute of Physics (IOP), have publicly acknowledged that they’ve seen no cancellations attributable to OA archiving. In fact, the APS and IOP have not only made peace with arXiv but now accept submissions from it and even host their own mirrors of it.
3. Other fields may not behave like physics.
We won’t know more until the levels of green OA in other fields approach those in physics.
It would definitely help to understand why the experience in physics has gone as it has and how far it might predict the experience in other fields. But so far it’s fair to say that we don’t know all the variables and that publishers who oppose green OA mandates are not among those showing a serious interest in them. When publisher lobbyists argue that high-volume green OA will undermine toll-access journal subscriptions, they don’t offer evidence, don’t acknowledge the countervailing evidence from physics, don’t rebut the evidence from physics, and don’t qualify their own conclusions in light of it. They would act more like scientific publishers if they acknowledged the evidence from physics and then argued, as well as they could, either that the experience in physics will change or that fields other than physics will have a different experience.
An October 2004 editorial in
The Lancet
(an Elsevier journal) called on the publishing lobby to do better. “[A]s editors of a journal that publishes research funded by the NIH, we disagree with [Association of American Publishers President Patricia Schroeder’s] central claim. Widening access to research [through green OA mandates] is unlikely to bring the edifice of scientific publishing crashing down. Schroeder provides no evidence that it would do so; she merely asserts the threat. This style of rebuttal will not do. . . .”
For more than eight years, green OA mandates have applied to research in many fields outside physics. These mandates are natural experiments and we’re still monitoring their effects. At Congressional hearings in 2008 and 2010, legislators asked publishers directly whether green OA was triggering cancellations. In both cases, publishers pointed to decreased downloads but not to increased cancellations.
4. There is evidence that green OA decreases downloads from publishers’ web sites.
When users know about OA and toll-access editions of the same article, many will prefer to click through to the OA edition, either because they aren’t affiliated with a subscribing institution or because authentication is a hassle. Moreover, when users find an OA edition, most stop looking. But decreased downloads are not the same thing as decreased or canceled subscriptions.
Moreover, decreased downloads of toll-access editions from publisher web sites are not the same thing as decreased downloads overall. No one suggests that green OA leads to decreased overall downloads, that is, fewer readers and less reading. On the contrary, the same evidence suggesting that OA increases citation impact also suggests that it increases readers and reading.
5. Most publishers voluntarily permit green OA.
Supplementing the natural experiments of green OA mandates are the natural experiments of publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. The Nature Publishing Group is more conservative than most toll-access publishers by requiring a six-month embargo on green OA, but more progressive than most by positively encouraging green OA. NPG reported the latest results of its multidisciplinary natural experiment in January 2011: “We have, to date, found author self-archiving compatible with subscription business models, and so we have been actively encouraging self-archiving since 2005.”
This or something similar to it must be the experience of the majority of toll-access publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. Even if they don’t actively encourage green OA, most permit it without embargo. If they found that it triggered cancellations, they would stop.
6. Green OA mandates leave standing at least four library incentives to maintain their subscriptions to toll-access journals.
Even the strongest no-loophole, no-waiver policies preserve incentives to maintain toll-access journal subscriptions.
First, all funder OA mandates include an embargo period to protect publishers. For example, the OA mandates at the Research Councils UK allow an embargo of up to six months after publication. The NIH allows an embargo of up to twelve months. Libraries wanting to provide immediate access will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Second, all funder OA mandates apply to the final version of the author’s peer-reviewed manuscript, not to the published version. If the journal provides copyediting after peer review, then the policies do not apply to the copyedited version, let alone to the formatted, paginated published edition. Libraries wanting to provide access to copyedited published editions will still have an incentive to subscribe.
The purpose of these two policy provisions is precisely to protect publishers against cancellations. They are deliberate concessions to publishers, adopted voluntarily by funding agencies as compromises with the public interest in immediate OA to the best editions. When we put the two together, we see that funder-mandated OA copies of peer-reviewed manuscripts won’t compete with toll-access copies of the published editions for six to twelve months, and there will never be OA copies of the more desirable published editions unless publishers voluntarily allow them. Publishers retain life-of-copyright exclusivity on the published editions. Even if OA archiving does eventually erode subscriptions outside physics, publishers have longer and better protection from these effects than their lobbyists ever acknowledge.
Third, funder OA mandates only apply to research articles, not to the many other kinds of content published in scholarly journals, such as letters, editorials, review articles, book reviews, announcements, news, conference information, and so on. Libraries wanting to provide access to these other kinds of content will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Fourth, funder OA mandates only apply to articles arising from research funded by the mandating agency. Very few journals publish nothing but articles from a single funder, or even from a set of funders all of whom have OA mandates. Libraries wanting to provide access to all the research articles in a journal, regardless of the sources of funding, will still have an incentive to subscribe. This incentive will weaken as more and more funders adopt OA mandates, but we’re very far from universal funder mandates. As we get closer, unfunded research will still fall outside this category and the three other incentives above will still stand.
The Association of College and Research Libraries addressed subscription incentives in a 2004 open letter on the NIH policy: “We wish to emphasize, above all, that academic libraries will not cancel journal subscriptions as a result of this plan. . . . Even if libraries wished to consider the availability of NIH-funded articles when making journal cancellation decisions, they would have no reasonable way of determining what articles in specific journals would become openly accessible after the embargo period.”
7. Some studies bear on the question of whether increased OA archiving will increase journal cancellations.
In a 2006 study from the Publishing Research Consortium (PRC), Chris Beckett and Simon Inger asked 400 librarians about the relative weight of different factors in their decisions to cancel subscriptions. Other things being equal, the librarians preferred free content to priced content and short embargoes to longer ones. Publishers interpret this to mean that the rise of OA archiving will cause cancellations. The chief flaw with the study is its artificiality. For example, the survey did not ask about specific journals by name but only about resources with abstractly stipulated levels of quality. It also disregarded faculty input on cancellation decisions when all librarians acknowledge that faculty input is decisive. The result was a study of hypothetical preferences, not actual cancellation decisions.
A less hypothetical study was commissioned by publishers themselves in the same year. From the summary:
The three most important factors used to determine journals for cancellation, in declining order of importance, are that the faculty no longer require it . . . , usage and price. Next, availability of the content via open access (OA) archives and availability via aggregators were ranked equal fourth, but some way behind the first three factors. The journal’s impact factor and availability via delayed OA were ranked relatively unimportant. . . . With regard to OA archives, there was a great deal of support for the idea that they would not directly impact journal subscriptions.
In short, toll-access journals have more to fear from their own price increases than from rising levels of green OA. Publishers who keep raising their prices aggravate the access problem for researchers and aggravate the sustainability problem for themselves. If the same publishers blame green OA and lobby against green OA policies, then they obstruct the solution for researchers and do very little to improve their own sustainability.
8. OA may increase submissions and subscriptions.
Some subscription journals have found that OA after an embargo period, even a very short one like two months, actually increases submissions and subscriptions. For example, this was the experience of the American Society for Cell Biology and its journal,
Molecular Biology of the Cell.
Medknow saw its submissions and subscriptions increase when it began offering unembargoed full-text editions of its journals alongside its toll-access print journals.
 
                                          Hindawi Publishing saw its submissions rise steadily after it converted all its peer-reviewed journals to OA in 2007. Looking back on several years of rapidly growing submissions, company founder and CEO Ahmed Hindawi said in January 2010, “It is clear now more than ever that our open access conversion . . . was the best management decision we have taken. . . .”
9. Some publishers fear that green OA will increase pressure to convert to gold OA.
Some publishers fear that rising levels of green OA will not only trigger toll-access journal cancellations but also increase pressure to convert to gold OA. (Likewise, some OA activists hope for this outcome.)
There are two responses to this two-fold fear. The fear of toll-access cancellations disregards the relevant evidence in points 1–8 above. The fear of conversion to gold OA also disregards relevant evidence, such as Ahmed Hindawi’s testimony above, and the testimony of Springer CEO Derk Haank. In 2008 when Springer bought BioMed Central and became the world’s largest OA publisher, Haank said: “[W]e see open access publishing as a sustainable part of STM publishing, and not an ideological crusade.” (Also see chapter 7 on economics.)
Publishers inexperienced with gold OA needn’t defer to publishers with more experience, but they should at least study them.
In fact, OA publishing might be more sustainable than TA publishing, as toll-access prices and the volume of research both grow faster than library budgets. (See section 2.1 on problems.) If publishers acknowledge that gold OA can be sustainable, and even profitable, and merely wish to avoid making lower margins than they make today, then their objection takes on a very different color. They’re not at risk of insolvency, just reduced profits, and they’re not asserting a need for self-protection, just an entitlement to current levels of profit. There’s no reason for public funding agencies acting in the public interest, or private funders acting for charitable purposes, to compromise their missions in order to satisfy that sense of publisher entitlement.
10. Green OA policies are justified even if they do create risks for toll-access journals.
If we’re only interested in the effect of rising levels of green OA on toll-access publishers, then we can stop at points 1–9. But if we’re interested in good policy, then we must add one more factor: Even if green OA does eventually threaten toll-access journal subscriptions, green OA policies are still justified.
I won’t elaborate this point here, since it takes us beyond the topic of casualties to the full case for OA, which is spread throughout the rest of the book. But here’s one way to put the debate in perspective: There are good reasons to want to know whether rising levels of green OA will trigger cancellations of toll-access journals, and perhaps even to modify our policies in light of what we learn. But there are no good reasons to put the thriving of incumbent toll-access journals and publishers ahead of the thriving of research itself.

45,"Open Access: Economics
Many publishers who oppose OA concede that OA is better for research and researchers than toll access.
 
                                          They merely object that we can’t pay for it. But we can pay for it.
The first major study of the economic impact of OA policies was conducted by John Houghton and Peter Sheehan in 2006. Using conservative estimates that a nation’s gross expenditure on research and development (GERD) brings social returns of 50 percent, and that OA increases access and efficiency by 5 percent, Houghton and Sheehan calculated that a transition to OA would not only pay for itself, but add $1.7 billion/year to the UK economy and $16 billion/year to the U.S. economy. A later study focusing on Australia used the more conservative estimate that GERD brings social returns of only 25 percent, but still found that the bottom-line economic benefits of OA for publicly funded research were 51 times greater than the costs.
Independent confirmation of Houghton’s results came in a major study released in April 2011, commissioned by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee, Publishing Research Consortium, Research Information Network, Research Libraries UK, and the Wellcome Trust. After studying five scenarios for improving research access, it concluded that green and gold OA “offer the greatest potential to policy-makers in promoting access. Both have positive, and potentially high, BCRs [benefit-cost ratios]. . . .”
The same study noted that “the infrastructure for Green [OA] has largely already been built” and therefore that “increasing access by this route is especially cost-effective. . . .” I can add that repositories scale up more easily than journals to capture unmet demand, and that depositing in a repository costs the depositor nothing. For all these reasons, I’ll focus in this chapter on how to pay for gold OA (journals), not how to pay for green OA (repositories).
Before turning to gold OA, however, I should note that there are widely varying estimates in the literature on what it costs a university to run an institutional repository. The divergence reflects the fact that repositories can serve many different purposes, and that some repositories serve more of them than others. If the minimum purpose is to host OA copies of faculty articles, and if faculty deposit their own articles, then the cost is minimal. But a repository is a general-purpose tool, and once launched there are good reasons for it to take on other responsibilities, such as long-term preservation, assisting faculty with digitization, permissions, and deposits, and hosting many other sorts of content, such as theses and dissertations, books or book chapters, conference proceedings, courseware, campus publications, digitized special collections, and administrative records. If the average repository is a significant expense today, the reason is that the average repository is doing significantly more than the minimum.
OA journals pay their bills the way broadcast television and radio stations do—not through advertising or pledge drives, but through a simple generalization on advertising and pledge drives. Those with an interest in disseminating the content pay the production costs upfront so that access can be free of charge for everyone with the right equipment. Elsewhere I’ve called this the “some pay for all” model.
Some OA journals have a subsidy from a university, library, foundation, society, museum, or government agency. Other OA journals charge a publication fee on accepted articles, to be paid by the author or the author’s sponsor (employer or funder). The party paying the subsidy or fee covers the journal’s expenses and readers pay nothing.
OA journals that charge publication fees tend to waive them in cases of economic hardship, and journals with institutional subsidies tend not to charge publication fees. OA journals can diversify their funding and get by on lower subsidies, or lower fees, if they also have revenue from print editions, advertising, priced add-ons, or auxiliary services. Some institutions and consortia arrange fee discounts, or purchase annual memberships that include fee waivers or discounts for all affiliated researchers.
Models that work well in some fields and nations may not work as well in others. No one claims that one size fits all. There’s still room for creativity in finding ways to pay the costs of a peer-reviewed OA journal, and many smart and motivated people are exploring different possibilities. Journals announce new variations almost every week, and we’re far from exhausting our cleverness and imagination.
Green OA may suffer from invisibility, but gold OA does not. On the contrary, researchers who don’t know about OA repositories still understand that there are OA journals. Sometimes the visibility gap is so large that researchers, journalists, and policy-makers conclude that all OA is gold OA (see section 3.1 on green and gold OA). As a result, most researchers who think about the benefits of OA think about the benefits of gold OA. Here, at least, the news is good. The most comprehensive survey to date shows that an overwhelming 89 percent of researchers from all fields believe that OA journals are beneficial to their fields.
Apart from the myth that all OA is gold OA, the most common myth about gold OA is that all OA journals charge “author fees” or use an “author-pays” business model. There are three mistakes here. The first is to assume that there is only one business model for OA journals, when there are many. The second is to assume that charging an upfront fee means authors are the ones expected to pay it. The third is to assume that all or even most OA journals charge upfront fees. In fact, most OA journals (70 percent) charge no upfront or author-side fees at all. By contrast, most toll-access journals (75 percent) do charge author-side fees. Moreover, even within the minority of fee-based OA journals, only 12 percent of those authors end up paying the fees out of pocket. Almost 90 percent of the time, the fees at fee-based journals are waived or paid by sponsors on behalf of authors.
Terminology
The terms “author fees” and “author pays” are specious and damaging. They’re false for the majority of OA journals, which charge no fees. They’re also misleading even for fee-based OA journals, where nearly nine times out of ten the fees are not paid by authors themselves. It’s more accurate to speak of “publication fees,” “processing fees,” or “author-side fees.” The first two don’t specify the payor, and the third merely specifies that the payment comes from the author side of the transaction, rather than the reader side, without implying that it must come from authors themselves.
The false beliefs that most OA journals charge author-side fees and that most toll-access journals don’t have caused several kinds of harm. They scare authors away from OA journals. They support the misconception that gold OA excludes indigent authors. When we add in the background myth that all OA is gold OA, this misconception suggests that OA as such—and not just gold OA—excludes indigent authors.
These false beliefs also support the insinuation that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. But if charging author-side fees for accepted papers really creates an incentive to lower standards, in order to rake in more fees, then most toll-access journals are guilty and most OA journals are not. In fact, however, when OA journals do charge author-side fees, they create firewalls between their financial and editorial operations. For example, most fee-based OA journals will waive their fees in cases of economic hardship, and take pains to prevent editors and referees engaged in peer review from knowing whether or not an author has requested a fee waiver. By contrast, at toll-access journals levying author-side page or color charges, editors generally know that accepted papers will entail revenue.
The false belief that most OA journals charge author-side fees also infects studies in which authors misinform survey subjects before surveying them. In effect: “At OA journals, authors pay to be published; now let me ask you a series of questions about your attitude toward OA journals.”
Finally, this false belief undermines calculations about who would bear the financial brunt if we made a general transition from toll-access journals to OA journals. A handful of studies have calculated that after a general conversion of peer-reviewed journals to OA, high-output universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. These calculations make at least two assumptions unjustified by present facts or trends: that all OA journals would charge fees, and that all fees would be paid by universities.
There are two kinds of OA journals, full and hybrid. Full OA journals provide OA to all their research articles. Hybrid OA journals provide OA to some and toll-access to others, when the choice is the author’s rather than the editor’s. Most hybrid OA journals charge a publication fee for the OA option. Authors who can find the money get immediate OA, and those who can’t or prefer not to, get toll access. (Many hybrid OA journals provide OA to all their articles after some time period, such as a year.) Some hybrid OA journals promise to reduce subscription prices in proportion to author uptake of the OA option, that is, to charge subscribers only for the toll-access articles. But most hybrid journal publishers don’t make this promise and “double dip” by charging subscription fees and publication fees for the same OA articles.
Hybrid OA is very low-risk for publishers. If the OA option has low uptake, the publisher loses nothing and still has subscription revenue. If it has high uptake, the publisher has subscription revenue for the conventional articles, publication fees for the OA articles, and sometimes both at once for the OA articles. Hence, the model has spread far and fast. The Professional/Scholarly Publishing division of the Association of American Publishers reported in 2011 that 74 percent of surveyed journals offering some form of OA in 2009 offered hybrid OA. At the same time, SHERPA listed more than 90 publishers offering hybrid OA options, including all of the largest publishers. Despite its spread, hybrid OA journals do little or nothing to help researchers, libraries, or publishers. The average rate of uptake for the OA option at hybrid journals is just 2 percent.
The chief virtue of hybrid OA journals is that they give publishers some firsthand experience with the economics and logistics of OA publishing. But the economics are artificial, since hybrid OA publishers have no incentive to increase author uptake and make the model succeed. The publishers always have subscriptions to fall back on. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of full-OA journals charge no publication fees and the overwhelming majority of hybrid-OA journals never gain firsthand experience with no-fee business models.
A growing number of for-profit OA publishers are making profits, and a growing number of nonprofit OA publishers are breaking even or making surpluses. Two different business models drive these sustainable publishing programs. BioMed Central makes profits and the Public Library of Science makes surpluses by charging publication fees. MedKnow makes profits without charging publication fees by selling priced print editions of its OA journals.
Fee-based OA journals tend to work best in fields where most research is funded, and no-fee journals tend to work best in fields and countries where comparatively little research is funded. The successes of these two business models give hope that gold OA can be sustainable in every discipline.
Every kind of peer-reviewed journal can become more sustainable by reducing costs. Although peer review is generally performed by unpaid volunteers, organizing or facilitating peer review is an expense. The journal must select referees, distribute files to referees, monitor who has what, track progress, nag dawdlers, collect comments and share them with the right people, facilitate communication, distinguish versions, and collect data on acceptances and rejections. One powerful way to reduce costs without reducing quality is to use free and open-source journal management software to automate the clerical tasks on this list.
The leader in this field is Open Journal Systems from the Public Knowledge Project, but there are more than a dozen other open-source packages. While OJS or other open-source software could benefit even toll-access journals, their use is concentrated among OA journals. OJS alone is has more than 9,000 installations (though not all are used for managing journals). This is not merely an example of how one openness movement can help another but also of how fearing openness can lead conventional publishers to forgo financial benefits and leave money on the table.
There are reasons to think that OA journals cost less to produce than toll-access journals of the same quality. OA journals dispense with subscription management (soliciting, negotiating, tracking, renewing subscribers), dispense with digital rights management (authenticating users, distinguishing authorized from unauthorized, blocking access to unauthorized), eliminate legal fees for licensing (drafting, negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing restrictive licenses), and reduce or eliminate marketing. In their place they add back little more than the cost of collecting publication fees or institutional subsidies. Several studies and OA publishers have testified to these lower costs.
We shouldn’t count the savings from dropping print, since most toll-access journals in the sciences have already dropped their print editions and those in the humanities are moving in the same direction.
We should be suspicious when large, venerable, conventional publishers say that in their experience the economics of OA publishing don’t work. Print-era publishers retooling for digital, and toll-access publishers retooling for OA, will inevitably realize smaller savings from OA than lean, mean OA start-ups without legacy equipment, personnel, or overhead from the age of print and subscriptions.
About one-quarter of all peer-reviewed journals today are OA. Like toll-access journals, some are in the black and thriving and some are in the red and struggling. However, the full range of OA journals begins to look like a success story when we consider that the vast majority of the money needed to support peer-reviewed journals is currently tied up in subscriptions to conventional journals. OA journals have reached their current numbers and quality despite the extraordinary squeeze on budgets devoted to the support of peer-reviewed journals.
Even if OA journals had the same production costs as toll-access journals, there’s enough money in the system to pay for peer-reviewed OA journals in every niche where we currently have peer-reviewed toll-access journals, and at the same level of quality. In fact, there’s more than enough, since we wouldn’t have to pay publisher profit margins surpassing those at ExxonMobil. Jan Velterop, the former publisher of BioMed Central, once said that OA publishing can be profitable but will “bring profit margins more in line with the added value.”
To support a full range of high-quality OA journals, we don’t need new money. We only need to redirect money we’re currently spending on peer-reviewed journals.
                                         
                                          There are many kinds of redirection. One is the voluntary conversion of toll-access journals to OA. Conversion could be a journal’s grudging response to declining library budgets for toll-access journals and exclusion from the big deals that take the lion’s share of library budgets. It could be a grudging response to its own past price increases and rising levels of green OA (see chapter 8 on casualties). Or it could be a hopeful and enthusiastic desire to achieve the benefits of OA for authors (greater audience and impact), readers (freedom from price and permission barriers), and publishers themselves (increased readership, citations, submissions, and quality).
Another kind of redirection is the rise of OA journal funds at universities. Even during times of declining budgets, libraries are setting aside money to pay publication fees at fee-based OA journals. The funds help faculty choose OA journals for their new work and help build a sustainable alternative to toll-access journals.
Redirection is also taking place on a large scale, primarily through CERN’s SCOAP3 project (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics). SCOAP3 is an ambitious plan to convert all the major toll-access journals in particle physics to OA, redirect the money formerly spent on reader-side subscription fees to author-side publication fees, and reduce the overall price to the journal-supporting institutions. It’s a peaceful revolution based on negotiation, consent, and self-interest. After four years of patiently building up budget pledges from libraries around the world, SCOAP3 entered its implementation phase in in April 2011.
If SCOAP3 succeeds, it won’t merely prove that CERN can pull off ambitious projects, which we already knew. It will prove that this particular ambitious project has an underlying win-win logic convincing to stakeholders. Some of the factors explaining the success of SCOAP3 to date are physics-specific, such as the small number of targeted journals, the green OA culture in physics embraced even by toll-access publishers, and the dominance of CERN. Other factors are not physics-specific, such as the evident benefits for research institutions, libraries, funders, and publishers. A success in particle physics would give hope that the model could be lifted and adapted to other fields without their own CERN-like institutions to pave the way. Other fields would not need CERN-like money or dominance so much as CERN-like convening power to bring the stakeholders to the table. Then the win-win logic would have a chance to take over from there.
Mark Rowse, former CEO of Ingenta, sketched another strategy for large-scale redirection in December 2003. A publisher could “flip” its toll-access journals to OA at one stroke by reinterpreting the payments it receives from university libraries as publication fees for a group of authors rather than subscription fees for a group of readers. One advantage over SCOAP3 is that the Rowsean flip can be tried one journal or one publisher at a time, and doesn’t require discipline-wide coordination. It could also scale up to the largest publishers or the largest coalitions of publishers.
We have to be imaginative but we don’t have to improvise. There are some principles we can try to follow. Money freed up by the cancellation or conversion of peer-reviewed TA journals should be spent first on peer-reviewed OA journals, to ensure the continuation of peer review. Large-scale redirection is more efficient than small-scale redirection. Peaceful revolution through negotiation and self-interest is more amicable and potentially more productive than adaptation forced by falling asteroids.
For the record, I advocate redirecting money freed up by cancellations or conversions, not canceling journals in order to free up money (except with SCOAP3 or Rowse-like consent and negotiation). This may look like hair-splitting, but the difference is neither small nor subtle. It’s roughly the difference between having great expectations and planning to kill your parents.

Almost 90 percent of the time, the fees at fee-based journals are waived or paid by sponsors on behalf of authors.
Terminology
The terms “author fees” and “author pays” are specious and damaging. They’re false for the majority of OA journals, which charge no fees. They’re also misleading even for fee-based OA journals, where nearly nine times out of ten the fees are not paid by authors themselves. It’s more accurate to speak of “publication fees,” “processing fees,” or “author-side fees.” The first two don’t specify the payor, and the third merely specifies that the payment comes from the author side of the transaction, rather than the reader side, without implying that it must come from authors themselves.
The false beliefs that most OA journals charge author-side fees and that most toll-access journals don’t have caused several kinds of harm. They scare authors away from OA journals. They support the misconception that gold OA excludes indigent authors. When we add in the background myth that all OA is gold OA, this misconception suggests that OA as such—and not just gold OA—excludes indigent authors.
These false beliefs also support the insinuation that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. But if charging author-side fees for accepted papers really creates an incentive to lower standards, in order to rake in more fees, then most toll-access journals are guilty and most OA journals are not. In fact, however, when OA journals do charge author-side fees, they create firewalls between their financial and editorial operations. For example, most fee-based OA journals will waive their fees in cases of economic hardship, and take pains to prevent editors and referees engaged in peer review from knowing whether or not an author has requested a fee waiver. By contrast, at toll-access journals levying author-side page or color charges, editors generally know that accepted papers will entail revenue.
The false belief that most OA journals charge author-side fees also infects studies in which authors misinform survey subjects before surveying them. In effect: “At OA journals, authors pay to be published; now let me ask you a series of questions about your attitude toward OA journals.”
Finally, this false belief undermines calculations about who would bear the financial brunt if we made a general transition from toll-access journals to OA journals. A handful of studies have calculated that after a general conversion of peer-reviewed journals to OA, high-output universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. These calculations make at least two assumptions unjustified by present facts or trends: that all OA journals would charge fees, and that all fees would be paid by universities.
There are two kinds of OA journals, full and hybrid. Full OA journals provide OA to all their research articles. Hybrid OA journals provide OA to some and toll-access to others, when the choice is the author’s rather than the editor’s. Most hybrid OA journals charge a publication fee for the OA option. Authors who can find the money get immediate OA, and those who can’t or prefer not to, get toll access. (Many hybrid OA journals provide OA to all their articles after some time period, such as a year.) Some hybrid OA journals promise to reduce subscription prices in proportion to author uptake of the OA option, that is, to charge subscribers only for the toll-access articles. But most hybrid journal publishers don’t make this promise and “double dip” by charging subscription fees and publication fees for the same OA articles.
Hybrid OA is very low-risk for publishers. If the OA option has low uptake, the publisher loses nothing and still has subscription revenue. If it has high uptake, the publisher has subscription revenue for the conventional articles, publication fees for the OA articles, and sometimes both at once for the OA articles. Hence, the model has spread far and fast. The Professional/Scholarly Publishing division of the Association of American Publishers reported in 2011 that 74 percent of surveyed journals offering some form of OA in 2009 offered hybrid OA. At the same time, SHERPA listed more than 90 publishers offering hybrid OA options, including all of the largest publishers. Despite its spread, hybrid OA journals do little or nothing to help researchers, libraries, or publishers. The average rate of uptake for the OA option at hybrid journals is just 2 percent.
The chief virtue of hybrid OA journals is that they give publishers some firsthand experience with the economics and logistics of OA publishing. But the economics are artificial, since hybrid OA publishers have no incentive to increase author uptake and make the model succeed. The publishers always have subscriptions to fall back on. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of full-OA journals charge no publication fees and the overwhelming majority of hybrid-OA journals never gain firsthand experience with no-fee business models.
A growing number of for-profit OA publishers are making profits, and a growing number of nonprofit OA publishers are breaking even or making surpluses. Two different business models drive these sustainable publishing programs. BioMed Central makes profits and the Public Library of Science makes surpluses by charging publication fees. MedKnow makes profits without charging publication fees by selling priced print editions of its OA journals.
Fee-based OA journals tend to work best in fields where most research is funded, and no-fee journals tend to work best in fields and countries where comparatively little research is funded. The successes of these two business models give hope that gold OA can be sustainable in every discipline.
Every kind of peer-reviewed journal can become more sustainable by reducing costs. Although peer review is generally performed by unpaid volunteers, organizing or facilitating peer review is an expense. The journal must select referees, distribute files to referees, monitor who has what, track progress, nag dawdlers, collect comments and share them with the right people, facilitate communication, distinguish versions, and collect data on acceptances and rejections. One powerful way to reduce costs without reducing quality is to use free and open-source journal management software to automate the clerical tasks on this list.
The leader in this field is Open Journal Systems from the Public Knowledge Project, but there are more than a dozen other open-source packages. While OJS or other open-source software could benefit even toll-access journals, their use is concentrated among OA journals. OJS alone is has more than 9,000 installations (though not all are used for managing journals). This is not merely an example of how one openness movement can help another but also of how fearing openness can lead conventional publishers to forgo financial benefits and leave money on the table.
There are reasons to think that OA journals cost less to produce than toll-access journals of the same quality. OA journals dispense with subscription management (soliciting, negotiating, tracking, renewing subscribers), dispense with digital rights management (authenticating users, distinguishing authorized from unauthorized, blocking access to unauthorized), eliminate legal fees for licensing (drafting, negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing restrictive licenses), and reduce or eliminate marketing. In their place they add back little more than the cost of collecting publication fees or institutional subsidies. Several studies and OA publishers have testified to these lower costs.
We shouldn’t count the savings from dropping print, since most toll-access journals in the sciences have already dropped their print editions and those in the humanities are moving in the same direction.
We should be suspicious when large, venerable, conventional publishers say that in their experience the economics of OA publishing don’t work. Print-era publishers retooling for digital, and toll-access publishers retooling for OA, will inevitably realize smaller savings from OA than lean, mean OA start-ups without legacy equipment, personnel, or overhead from the age of print and subscriptions.
About one-quarter of all peer-reviewed journals today are OA. Like toll-access journals, some are in the black and thriving and some are in the red and struggling. However, the full range of OA journals begins to look like a success story when we consider that the vast majority of the money needed to support peer-reviewed journals is currently tied up in subscriptions to conventional journals. OA journals have reached their current numbers and quality despite the extraordinary squeeze on budgets devoted to the support of peer-reviewed journals.
Even if OA journals had the same production costs as toll-access journals, there’s enough money in the system to pay for peer-reviewed OA journals in every niche where we currently have peer-reviewed toll-access journals, and at the same level of quality. In fact, there’s more than enough, since we wouldn’t have to pay publisher profit margins surpassing those at ExxonMobil. Jan Velterop, the former publisher of BioMed Central, once said that OA publishing can be profitable but will “bring profit margins more in line with the added value.”
To support a full range of high-quality OA journals, we don’t need new money. We only need to redirect money we’re currently spending on peer-reviewed journals.
                                         
                                          There are many kinds of redirection. One is the voluntary conversion of toll-access journals to OA. Conversion could be a journal’s grudging response to declining library budgets for toll-access journals and exclusion from the big deals that take the lion’s share of library budgets. It could be a grudging response to its own past price increases and rising levels of green OA (see chapter 8 on casualties). Or it could be a hopeful and enthusiastic desire to achieve the benefits of OA for authors (greater audience and impact), readers (freedom from price and permission barriers), and publishers themselves (increased readership, citations, submissions, and quality).
Another kind of redirection is the rise of OA journal funds at universities. Even during times of declining budgets, libraries are setting aside money to pay publication fees at fee-based OA journals. The funds help faculty choose OA journals for their new work and help build a sustainable alternative to toll-access journals.
Redirection is also taking place on a large scale, primarily through CERN’s SCOAP3 project (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics). SCOAP3 is an ambitious plan to convert all the major toll-access journals in particle physics to OA, redirect the money formerly spent on reader-side subscription fees to author-side publication fees, and reduce the overall price to the journal-supporting institutions. It’s a peaceful revolution based on negotiation, consent, and self-interest. After four years of patiently building up budget pledges from libraries around the world, SCOAP3 entered its implementation phase in in April 2011.
If SCOAP3 succeeds, it won’t merely prove that CERN can pull off ambitious projects, which we already knew. It will prove that this particular ambitious project has an underlying win-win logic convincing to stakeholders. Some of the factors explaining the success of SCOAP3 to date are physics-specific, such as the small number of targeted journals, the green OA culture in physics embraced even by toll-access publishers, and the dominance of CERN. Other factors are not physics-specific, such as the evident benefits for research institutions, libraries, funders, and publishers. A success in particle physics would give hope that the model could be lifted and adapted to other fields without their own CERN-like institutions to pave the way. Other fields would not need CERN-like money or dominance so much as CERN-like convening power to bring the stakeholders to the table. Then the win-win logic would have a chance to take over from there.
Mark Rowse, former CEO of Ingenta, sketched another strategy for large-scale redirection in December 2003. A publisher could “flip” its toll-access journals to OA at one stroke by reinterpreting the payments it receives from university libraries as publication fees for a group of authors rather than subscription fees for a group of readers. One advantage over SCOAP3 is that the Rowsean flip can be tried one journal or one publisher at a time, and doesn’t require discipline-wide coordination. It could also scale up to the largest publishers or the largest coalitions of publishers.
We have to be imaginative but we don’t have to improvise. There are some principles we can try to follow. Money freed up by the cancellation or conversion of peer-reviewed TA journals should be spent first on peer-reviewed OA journals, to ensure the continuation of peer review. Large-scale redirection is more efficient than small-scale redirection. Peaceful revolution through negotiation and self-interest is more amicable and potentially more productive than adaptation forced by falling asteroids.
For the record, I advocate redirecting money freed up by cancellations or conversions, not canceling journals in order to free up money (except with SCOAP3 or Rowse-like consent and negotiation). This may look like hair-splitting, but the difference is neither small nor subtle. It’s roughly the difference between having great expectations and planning to kill your parents.

46,"The end of the web
In the past year, as we have witnessed the upending of the political order, the internet has been the theatre where many of the battles have been fought: from the hacking and leaking of Democratic party emails, to the proliferation of fake news and alternative facts, and yes, the outpourings of @realDonaldTrump. 

 With domestic and geopolitical tensions rising, governments are finding it increasingly hard to function amid a constant barrage of uncontrollable information and potential cyber-attacks, making them grow more wary both of the internet's influence and their ability to control it.
The fallout from this means we are facing the prospect of countries around the world pulling the plug on the open, global internet and creating their own independent networks. We might be about to see the end of the world wide internet as we know it.
With globalisation under attack, the ultimate bastion of borderlessness – the global internet – might very well be one the biggest scalps taken by the newly emerging world order heralded in by Brexit and Trump. If a global orthodoxy of free trade, soft power and international organisations is overpowered by belligerent nations and isolationism, the net will inevitably be swept away with it.
Yet although fragmentation – and ultimately also Balkanisation – will carry great social and economic cost, it could also be an opportunity. Europe, which has already been flexing its muscles when it comes to internet policy, now finds itself forced to rely less on US cooperation. It should therefore become a frontrunner in developing an alternative, decentralised internet, with its root values of fairness, openness and democracy restored. This could help the net – and indeed Europe – to become more resilient again. As much as we fear the 'splinternet', we should welcome the Euronet.
Weaponisation of the internet
Since we've become dependent on the internet for almost everything we do, dangers to the network's integrity threaten devastating effects. Governments may be tempted to turn inwards in an attempt to shield themselves and their citizens from cyber-attacks. 

 

 Last October, unknown hackers used an array of badly secured 'internet of things' (IoT) devices to bring down most of the internet on the east coast of America in one of the largest DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks to date. While depriving Americans of Amazon and Facebook for several hours was surely an inconvenience, the potential of the weaponised internet to do harm is infinitely greater. 

 

 As more of the components of a country's critical infrastructure move online, the number of possible targets grows too. Hackers shut down a significant part of Ukraine's electricity grid in 2015, and crippled several important Estonian industries, including its banks, in 2007.
Many cyber-security experts warn about the lacklustre defence of everything from air traffic control towers and voting machines to nuclear plants. One well-placed attack could do more damage than the most aggressive of traditional military campaigns, at a fraction of the cost. Because of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding cyber-capabilities – 'know your enemy' is a hard adage to follow if potential culprits and their capabilities are so tough to track – it has become impossible for governments to completely shield their countries from cyber-attacks. 

 

 The growing urge to control the internet has also become apparent over the influence of so-called fake news. Distorting public opinion and fact as a manipulation technique is nothing new: it's been used since Roman times. But the relentless pace and scope with which the internet allows information to disseminate is quite unprecedented. Governments and the media (who have themselves often swapped truth for clicks) are having an increasingly hard time stemming the flow of biased or misleading news stories. So the democratic process suffers. 

 

 The solutions offered by the reluctant tech giants providing a platform for fake news won't be sufficient to stop it altogether. This will prompt more countries to follow Russia and China in building their own platforms like VKontakte and Baidu, thus reducing foreign influence and allowing for extensive censorship and monitoring. The desire of developing countries to establish their own social networks will see them retreat into their own national bubbles.
Fragile infrastructure
While cyber attacks and false information campaigns use the internet to attack the infrastructure by which our societies function, the internet's own infrastructure is also at risk. Despite the internet's ephemeral, lawless appeal, its underlying network of cables, tubes and wires is very much rooted in the physical world. Over 99 per cent of all global internet communications are facilitated by an impressive web of undersea cables, connecting all corners of the world. A submarine deliberately destroying one of these cables in a hard-to-reach place could bring down access to parts of the internet for weeks; and so, by extension, all the systems that rely upon it. 

 

 The fallibility of this shared infrastructure also makes it impossible to keep foreign or hostile actors out of domestic affairs. Though governments that heavily restrict internet access might find it easier to prevent information from flowing in and out of the country, they are still reliant on the same co-owned systems, with some parts inevitably falling under other countries' jurisdictions. 

 This became very clear after the 2013 Snowden revelations, which showed that the US routinely tapped into foreign internet traffic routed through the country. The massive scale of this monitoring even led then president of Brazil Dilma Rousseff to call for the construction of an undersea cable from Brazil directly to Europe, bypassing the prying eyes of the National Security Agency altogether. And US intelligence agencies are by no means the only ones doing this kind of snooping, as we know all too well. 

 

 With various nations eyeing each other suspiciously and traditional alliances crumbling, building alternative structures to make foreign interference more difficult seems a logical consequence.
Who rules the internet?
It won't just be the actual infrastructure and 'hard' elements of the internet where governments will seek more independence. Internet governance, the catch-all term to describe the processes and decisions that determine how the internet is managed, and how its technical norms and standards are set, is increasingly complex. 

 

 In principle, no single actor should be in charge of the internet governance processes. Ideally, these should be overseen by a multi-stakeholder model where governments, the private sector and advocacy groups would have an equal voice and where anyone could be allowed to become involved. In practice, however, it is US government institutions and companies – yes, the usual suspects – that set the rules. They tend to be over-represented in meetings, and in charge of some of the largest regulatory bodies. American stewardship over the internet has long been an area of contention. Countries like China, Russia, and many (mainly developing) countries want more control over their own domestic networks, preferring to see the current model replaced by something more Westphalian, perhaps resembling the United Nations. 

 This discussion will likely flair up again soon as the Trump administration seeks ways to reverse the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) transition: an arcane but highly controversial policy issue. IANA is the agency in charge of maintaining the global DNS (Domain Name System) as well as managing Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation and other important basic structural functions of the internet. The internet’s IANA functions had traditionally been managed by the non-profit ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), but remained under contract of the US Department of Commerce, which oversaw its processes – effectively leaving it under US government control. After almost 20 years of bickering and international kowtowing, IANA was brought under full ICANN control last October, finally becoming fully independent. This to the great dismay of many Republican lawmakers; particularly senator Ted Cruz, who has been fighting to stop the process for years. 

 If the US government does decide to overturn the transition (and Trump has certainly shown enthusiasm for overturning decisions of the previous administration), it will do a lot of damage to the American-led governance process. How much credibility can it have when the most important partner doesn't even play by the rules? 

 As these tensions increase, we'll likely see a push for more government bodies to take control of internet governance (such as the short-lived, Brazil-led NETMundial initiative), abandoning the more inclusive and cooperative approach involving businesses and civil society organisations. Then if the process fell even further apart, it would be a substantial challenge to the interoperable global internet, as regulations and standards swiftly went in different directions.
The Big Four
Though the internet was initially heralded as the greatest democratiser of information since Gutenberg, most data now flows through only a handful of companies. Silicon Valley tech giants, with the 'Big Four' of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon at the helm, rake in most of the spoils of the all-conquering global online economy. 

 In their ambition to expand even further, these tech companies are themselves also an important cause of internet fragmentation, erecting 'walled gardens' all over the world. Facebook's controversial Free Basics service, which offers free data plans to users in developing countries, but which restricts access to a small number of Facebook-approved websites, is a prime example. Some call it digital colonialism. 

 These moves aimed at generating even more revenue, concentrated in the hands of the few as inequality rises, understandably cause concern among governments and citizens alike. But our main worry should not be about economics. The Big Four – controlling our data, as well as our access to information – wield an inordinate amount of power. Indeed, Denmark recently announced it would appoint a igital ambassador specifically to deal with these technology giants, citing their influence as larger than that of many countries. 

 Citizens worldwide have become so dependent on these platforms that there are effectively no readily available alternatives to move to if things turn sour. The sheer scale of the Women's March and similar demonstrations in recent weeks would not have been possible without the ability to organise online. What if these channels fall away, their freedom restricted by companies under the yoke of a hostile government? 

 Though many American technology companies have already pledged they will not assist with the creation of a 'Muslim registry' – and have pushed back on Trump’s latest immigration restrictions
–
we have to be very aware that the amount of personal data they have on each of us would make it far too easy for them to do so. 

 Foreign governments, which in the current political climate cannot rely on Google abiding by its mantra, 'Don't be evil', will aggressively start to pursue the construction of domestic alternatives. It is something we are already seeing happening worldwide.
The splinternet
Though the dream of the web internet pioneers was one of a completely open, non-hierarchical internet, over the years barriers have been springing up that restrict this freedom. Bit by bit, the internet is becoming more cordoned off.  

 The idea of splitting up the internet into different, Balkanised internets – with a completely separate infrastructure – is not new. After the Snowden revelations, Germany took action and started looking into the construction of the 'Internetz', a German-only network (although one that allows for the possibility of expanding to the rest of the EU). 

 We do not currently have an example of a real internet island in place, but the closest version we see is probably the Great Firewall of China. Though China hasn't built an entirely separate infrastructure, its internet looks entirely different from what we are used to, with content heavily censored and many platforms and websites completely banned. 

 Russia appears to be following suit. Last November, Russia banned LinkedIn from operating in the country because the social network did not adhere to a new law decreeing that all data generated by Russian users should be stored within Russia itself. In recent weeks, news has also emerged that Moscow has been working with Beijing to implement something similar to the Great Firewall for its own domestic users. Democracies and autocracies alike have long come to understand the great power of the internet and have learned how to both harness and restrict it. 

 Who will be the first to go it alone? It's difficult to say yet but the usual suspects are lining up: China; Russia; Europe; even Trump's America
.
Other countries like Brazil or Turkey might see a compelling reason to do so as well. 

 Now that we are so used to a ubiquitous and global internet, it's hard to imagine what a world of fragmented, national internets might look like. What we do know is that the internet of fun and games, of unfettered access, is quickly coming to an end. When it does, it will be another big nail in the coffin for globalisation.
Breaking free
The idea of a Balkanised internet, of different national and supranational internet islands, is a dark one. What living in such a future would look like, no one knows. Inevitably, though, it would herald a world of less mutual understanding, less shared prosperity and shrinking horizons. 

 However, the fragmentation of the internet need not be bad news. As the limitations of its original incarnation are becoming increasingly clear, starting from scratch provides us with an important opportunity to right our initial wrongs. We can build a network or networks that are more ethical, inclusive and resilient to outside threats. 

 While this is a moment of disharmony and uncertainty for the European project, the EU has much it agrees upon when it comes to policy and regulating the internet's mostly American corporate giants: from its ambitious data protection policies and the right to be forgotten, to Apple tax case. But it could do more. The global internet as we know it today began as a public space where everyone had an equal opportunity to use it as we liked. But it has quickly privatised, locking us into platforms that 'harvest' our data. As European citizens grow increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of the internet, the EU has a great opportunity. 

 The EU should take a different approach to the internet and, rather than making it an unregulated free-for-all, consider it a 'commons': a public good open to all, excluding none. The EU could create and fund the infrastructure for this and help ensure safety for all. Meanwhile, small businesses and individuals would do their bit by creating a variety of tools to add to this commons, which would become fully interoperable through shared standards and underpinning technologies. 

 One necessary component of such an internet commons is that it should be decentralised. Decentralising the internet and rethinking its structure would allow users to take back control over the network of networks, letting them manage their own personal data rather than giving it away to large companies, as well as offering them more choice over the tools they use. It is also often said that distributed internets would also inherently be much safer: largescale cyber-attacks are easier to prevent if we reduce the number of central nodes that traffic can travel through. 

 But a European internet would above all need to be radically ambitious – especially with the EU in a fractured state. The rules for the decentralised, new internet are still wide open, and we have the opportunity to set them. The emergence of a new world order is forcing Europe to rethink itself, come closer together and defend its values in the world. Creating a completely new internet built around these values – and open to any like-minded country to join – might be one extraordinarily effective way of achieving it.

How much credibility can it have when the most important partner doesn't even play by the rules? 

 As these tensions increase, we'll likely see a push for more government bodies to take control of internet governance (such as the short-lived, Brazil-led NETMundial initiative), abandoning the more inclusive and cooperative approach involving businesses and civil society organisations. Then if the process fell even further apart, it would be a substantial challenge to the interoperable global internet, as regulations and standards swiftly went in different directions.
The Big Four
Though the internet was initially heralded as the greatest democratiser of information since Gutenberg, most data now flows through only a handful of companies. Silicon Valley tech giants, with the 'Big Four' of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon at the helm, rake in most of the spoils of the all-conquering global online economy. 

 In their ambition to expand even further, these tech companies are themselves also an important cause of internet fragmentation, erecting 'walled gardens' all over the world. Facebook's controversial Free Basics service, which offers free data plans to users in developing countries, but which restricts access to a small number of Facebook-approved websites, is a prime example. Some call it digital colonialism. 

 These moves aimed at generating even more revenue, concentrated in the hands of the few as inequality rises, understandably cause concern among governments and citizens alike. But our main worry should not be about economics. The Big Four – controlling our data, as well as our access to information – wield an inordinate amount of power. Indeed, Denmark recently announced it would appoint a igital ambassador specifically to deal with these technology giants, citing their influence as larger than that of many countries. 

 Citizens worldwide have become so dependent on these platforms that there are effectively no readily available alternatives to move to if things turn sour. The sheer scale of the Women's March and similar demonstrations in recent weeks would not have been possible without the ability to organise online. What if these channels fall away, their freedom restricted by companies under the yoke of a hostile government? 

 Though many American technology companies have already pledged they will not assist with the creation of a 'Muslim registry' – and have pushed back on Trump’s latest immigration restrictions
–
we have to be very aware that the amount of personal data they have on each of us would make it far too easy for them to do so. 

 Foreign governments, which in the current political climate cannot rely on Google abiding by its mantra, 'Don't be evil', will aggressively start to pursue the construction of domestic alternatives. It is something we are already seeing happening worldwide.
The splinternet
Though the dream of the web internet pioneers was one of a completely open, non-hierarchical internet, over the years barriers have been springing up that restrict this freedom. Bit by bit, the internet is becoming more cordoned off.  

 The idea of splitting up the internet into different, Balkanised internets – with a completely separate infrastructure – is not new. After the Snowden revelations, Germany took action and started looking into the construction of the 'Internetz', a German-only network (although one that allows for the possibility of expanding to the rest of the EU). 

 We do not currently have an example of a real internet island in place, but the closest version we see is probably the Great Firewall of China. Though China hasn't built an entirely separate infrastructure, its internet looks entirely different from what we are used to, with content heavily censored and many platforms and websites completely banned. 

 Russia appears to be following suit. Last November, Russia banned LinkedIn from operating in the country because the social network did not adhere to a new law decreeing that all data generated by Russian users should be stored within Russia itself. In recent weeks, news has also emerged that Moscow has been working with Beijing to implement something similar to the Great Firewall for its own domestic users. Democracies and autocracies alike have long come to understand the great power of the internet and have learned how to both harness and restrict it. 

 Who will be the first to go it alone? It's difficult to say yet but the usual suspects are lining up: China; Russia; Europe; even Trump's America
.
Other countries like Brazil or Turkey might see a compelling reason to do so as well. 

 Now that we are so used to a ubiquitous and global internet, it's hard to imagine what a world of fragmented, national internets might look like. What we do know is that the internet of fun and games, of unfettered access, is quickly coming to an end. When it does, it will be another big nail in the coffin for globalisation.
Breaking free
The idea of a Balkanised internet, of different national and supranational internet islands, is a dark one. What living in such a future would look like, no one knows. Inevitably, though, it would herald a world of less mutual understanding, less shared prosperity and shrinking horizons. 

 However, the fragmentation of the internet need not be bad news. As the limitations of its original incarnation are becoming increasingly clear, starting from scratch provides us with an important opportunity to right our initial wrongs. We can build a network or networks that are more ethical, inclusive and resilient to outside threats. 

 While this is a moment of disharmony and uncertainty for the European project, the EU has much it agrees upon when it comes to policy and regulating the internet's mostly American corporate giants: from its ambitious data protection policies and the right to be forgotten, to Apple tax case. But it could do more. The global internet as we know it today began as a public space where everyone had an equal opportunity to use it as we liked. But it has quickly privatised, locking us into platforms that 'harvest' our data. As European citizens grow increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of the internet, the EU has a great opportunity. 

 The EU should take a different approach to the internet and, rather than making it an unregulated free-for-all, consider it a 'commons': a public good open to all, excluding none. The EU could create and fund the infrastructure for this and help ensure safety for all. Meanwhile, small businesses and individuals would do their bit by creating a variety of tools to add to this commons, which would become fully interoperable through shared standards and underpinning technologies. 

 One necessary component of such an internet commons is that it should be decentralised. Decentralising the internet and rethinking its structure would allow users to take back control over the network of networks, letting them manage their own personal data rather than giving it away to large companies, as well as offering them more choice over the tools they use. It is also often said that distributed internets would also inherently be much safer: largescale cyber-attacks are easier to prevent if we reduce the number of central nodes that traffic can travel through. 

 But a European internet would above all need to be radically ambitious – especially with the EU in a fractured state. The rules for the decentralised, new internet are still wide open, and we have the opportunity to set them. The emergence of a new world order is forcing Europe to rethink itself, come closer together and defend its values in the world. Creating a completely new internet built around these values – and open to any like-minded country to join – might be one extraordinarily effective way of achieving it.

When Joseph got to the office his ears were aching from the noise of
 the copter and from his earplugs. Lately, every little thing seemed to
 make him irritable. He supposed it was because his drafting department
 was behind schedule on the latest Defense contract. His ears were sore
 and his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.


 Walking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The
 constant clatter of typewriters and office machines gave him a sense
 of efficiency, of stability, an all-is-well-with-the-world feeling. He
 waved to a few of the more familiar employees and smiled, but of course
 you couldn't say hello with the continual racket.


 This morning, somehow, it didn't make him feel better. He supposed it
 was because of the song they were playing over the speakers, ""Slam Bang
 Boom,"" the latest Top Hit. He hated that song.


 Of course the National Mental Health people said constant music had a
 beneficial effect on office workers, so Joseph was no one to object,
 even though he did wonder if anyone could ever actually listen to it
 over the other noise.


 In his own office the steady din was hardly diminished despite
 soundproofing, and since he was next to an outside wall he was
 subjected also to the noises of the city. He stood staring out of the
 huge window for awhile, watching the cars on the freeway and listening
 to the homogeneous rumble and scream of turbines.
Something's wrong with me
, he thought.
I shouldn't be feeling this
 way. Nerves. Nerves.
He turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She
 simpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.


 ""Betty,"" he told her, ""I want you to make an appointment with my
 therapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it's just a case of nerves,
 though.""


 ""Yes sir. Anything else?"" Her voice, like every one's, was a high
 pitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.


 Joseph winced. ""Anybody want to see me this morning?""


 ""Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to
 show you.""


 ""Let him in whenever he's ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes
 up, I want you to leave me alone.""


 ""Yes, sir, certainly."" She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile
 that seemed to want to be something more.


 Joseph switched off.
That was a damn funny way of saying it
, he thought.
""I want you to
 leave me alone."" As if somebody were after me.
He spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed
 up so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.


 ""I'm afraid you'll have to make it brief, Bob,"" he grinned. ""I've a
 whale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting
 headache. Nerves, you know.""


 ""Sure, Mister Partch. I won't take a minute; I just thought you'd like
 to have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our
 progress so far....""


 ""Yes, yes, just go ahead. How does the thing work?""


 Bob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch's desk, sat down in
 front of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.


 It was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It
 was one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly
 air-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs—and
 that helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem
 by using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons
 were the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a
 technological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from
 a commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men
 mad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly
 satisfactory solution.


 But now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A
 device that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound
 waves, leaving behind only heat.


 It should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn't make
 himself get interested in it.


 ""The really big problem is the power requirement,"" Wills was saying.
 ""We've got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but
 we've got several possible answers in mind and we're working on all of
 them.""


 He caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.


 ""The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a
 static test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty
 fair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the
 noise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. Of course, I still needed my
 plugs.""


 Joseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of
 transistors and tubes.


 ""I've built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current,"" Wills told
 him. ""In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody.""


 Partch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.


 ""Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don't you just leave
 it here in my office and I'll look it over later, hm?""


 ""Okay, Mr. Partch.""


 Joseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on
 the good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone
 again behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden
 yearning for company, for someone to talk to.
Partch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk
 nibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he
 was getting an ulcer.


 Yes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.
 Coles that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his
 feeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk
 about it.


 Oh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was
 it. A rut.


 He spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the
 automatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.


 Joseph winced. The speakers were playing ""Slam Bang Boom"" again.


 His mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look
 inward on himself.


 Of what, after all, did Joseph Partch's life consist? He licked his
 fingers and thought about it.


 What would he do this evening after work, for instance?


 Why, he'd stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the
 commuter's copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming
 of the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played
 on the copter's speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise
 and through the plugs.


 And then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his
 wife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from
 the automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.
 Perhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.


 Partch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day's
 work, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen
 bomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of
 knowing when.


 And what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?
 Why, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen
 years. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the
 musical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the
 loud songs....


 And every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of
 Felicia's friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.


 Perhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks
 and talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.


 There would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of
 the monorail horn at intervals.


 And then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the
 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.


 Joseph Partch's world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.
 Dimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if
 all the sounds were once taken away.
Why
, after all, was the world
 of Man so noisy? It was almost as if—as if everybody were making as
 much noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something
 lacking. Or something they were afraid of.


 Like a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.


 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound
 and noise.


 Almost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of
space
would
 be like.


 And then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills' machine. It could
 reduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had
 said. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a
 rocket motor.


 And the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.


 Partch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....


 But what would Dr. Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to
 get a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....


 But looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line
 cord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph's body. The
 sense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn't recognize it yet.


 An absence of
sound
? No! Silly!


 Then a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the
 window, filling the office with an ocean of noise.


 Joseph's hand jerked and flicked the switch.


 And then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before
 that had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came
 back to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.


 In the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a
real
forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human
 civilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.


 It was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. There was no
 wind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,
completely
alone.


 And it was—quiet.


 Doctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.


 ""I've only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.
 Leeds.""


 Leeds nodded.


 ""It
is
rather rare. Look at him—total catatonia. He's curled into a
 perfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I'm afraid.""


 ""The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially
 to a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.""


 ""Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills' is extremely dangerous. What amazes
 me is that it didn't kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him
 when we did.""


 Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw.


 ""Yes, you know it
is
incredible how much the human mind can sometimes
 take, actually. As you say, it's a wonder it didn't kill him.""


 He shook his head.


 ""Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he
 was alone with that machine. Imagine—
two hours
of total silence!""

 and his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.


 Walking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The
 constant clatter of typewriters and office machines gave him a sense
 of efficiency, of stability, an all-is-well-with-the-world feeling. He
 waved to a few of the more familiar employees and smiled, but of course
 you couldn't say hello with the continual racket.


 This morning, somehow, it didn't make him feel better. He supposed it
 was because of the song they were playing over the speakers, ""Slam Bang
 Boom,"" the latest Top Hit. He hated that song.


 Of course the National Mental Health people said constant music had a
 beneficial effect on office workers, so Joseph was no one to object,
 even though he did wonder if anyone could ever actually listen to it
 over the other noise.


 In his own office the steady din was hardly diminished despite
 soundproofing, and since he was next to an outside wall he was
 subjected also to the noises of the city. He stood staring out of the
 huge window for awhile, watching the cars on the freeway and listening
 to the homogeneous rumble and scream of turbines.
Something's wrong with me
, he thought.
I shouldn't be feeling this
 way. Nerves. Nerves.
He turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She
 simpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.


 ""Betty,"" he told her, ""I want you to make an appointment with my
 therapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it's just a case of nerves,
 though.""


 ""Yes sir. Anything else?"" Her voice, like every one's, was a high
 pitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.


 Joseph winced. ""Anybody want to see me this morning?""


 ""Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to
 show you.""


 ""Let him in whenever he's ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes
 up, I want you to leave me alone.""


 ""Yes, sir, certainly."" She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile
 that seemed to want to be something more.


 Joseph switched off.
That was a damn funny way of saying it
, he thought.
""I want you to
 leave me alone."" As if somebody were after me.
He spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed
 up so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.


 ""I'm afraid you'll have to make it brief, Bob,"" he grinned. ""I've a
 whale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting
 headache. Nerves, you know.""


 ""Sure, Mister Partch. I won't take a minute; I just thought you'd like
 to have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our
 progress so far....""


 ""Yes, yes, just go ahead. How does the thing work?""


 Bob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch's desk, sat down in
 front of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.


 It was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It
 was one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly
 air-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs—and
 that helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem
 by using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons
 were the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a
 technological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from
 a commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men
 mad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly
 satisfactory solution.


 But now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A
 device that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound
 waves, leaving behind only heat.


 It should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn't make
 himself get interested in it.


 ""The really big problem is the power requirement,"" Wills was saying.
 ""We've got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but
 we've got several possible answers in mind and we're working on all of
 them.""


 He caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.


 ""The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a
 static test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty
 fair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the
 noise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. Of course, I still needed my
 plugs.""


 Joseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of
 transistors and tubes.


 ""I've built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current,"" Wills told
 him. ""In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody.""


 Partch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.


 ""Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don't you just leave
 it here in my office and I'll look it over later, hm?""


 ""Okay, Mr. Partch.""


 Joseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on
 the good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone
 again behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden
 yearning for company, for someone to talk to.
Partch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk
 nibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he
 was getting an ulcer.


 Yes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.
 Coles that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his
 feeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk
 about it.


 Oh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was
 it. A rut.


 He spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the
 automatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.


 Joseph winced. The speakers were playing ""Slam Bang Boom"" again.


 His mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look
 inward on himself.


 Of what, after all, did Joseph Partch's life consist? He licked his
 fingers and thought about it.


 What would he do this evening after work, for instance?


 Why, he'd stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the
 commuter's copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming
 of the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played
 on the copter's speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise
 and through the plugs.


 And then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his
 wife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from
 the automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.
 Perhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.


 Partch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day's
 work, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen
 bomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of
 knowing when.


 And what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?
 Why, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen
 years. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the
 musical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the
 loud songs....


 And every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of
 Felicia's friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.


 Perhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks
 and talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.


 There would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of
 the monorail horn at intervals.


 And then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the
 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.


 Joseph Partch's world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.
 Dimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if
 all the sounds were once taken away.
Why
, after all, was the world
 of Man so noisy? It was almost as if—as if everybody were making as
 much noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something
 lacking. Or something they were afraid of.


 Like a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.


 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound
 and noise.


 Almost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of
space
would
 be like.


 And then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills' machine. It could
 reduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had
 said. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a
 rocket motor.


 And the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.


 Partch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....


 But what would Dr. Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to
 get a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....


 But looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line
 cord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph's body. The
 sense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn't recognize it yet.


 An absence of
sound
? No! Silly!


 Then a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the
 window, filling the office with an ocean of noise.


 Joseph's hand jerked and flicked the switch.


 And then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before
 that had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came
 back to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.


 In the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a
real
forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human
 civilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.


 It was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. There was no
 wind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,
completely
alone.


 And it was—quiet.


 Doctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.


 ""I've only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.
 Leeds.""


 Leeds nodded.


 ""It
is
rather rare. Look at him—total catatonia. He's curled into a
 perfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I'm afraid.""


 ""The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially
 to a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.""


 ""Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills' is extremely dangerous. What amazes
 me is that it didn't kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him
 when we did.""


 Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw.


 ""Yes, you know it
is
incredible how much the human mind can sometimes
 take, actually. As you say, it's a wonder it didn't kill him.""


 He shook his head.


 ""Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he
 was alone with that machine. Imagine—
two hours
of total silence!""

When Joseph got to the office his ears were aching from the noise of
 the copter and from his earplugs. Lately, every little thing seemed to
 make him irritable. He supposed it was because his drafting department
 was behind schedule on the latest Defense contract. His ears were sore
 and his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.


 Walking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The

 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.


 Joseph Partch's world was made up of sounds and noises, he decided.
 Dimly, he wondered of what civilization itself would be constructed if
 all the sounds were once taken away.
Why
, after all, was the world
 of Man so noisy? It was almost as if—as if everybody were making as
 much noise as they could to conceal the fact that there was something
 lacking. Or something they were afraid of.


 Like a little boy whistling loudly as he walks by a cemetery at night.


 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound
 and noise.


 Almost, it was like trying to imagine what a negation of
space
would
 be like.


 And then he turned, and his eyes fell on Bob Wills' machine. It could
 reduce the noise level of a rocket motor by 25 per cent, Wills had
 said. Here in the office, the sound level was less than that of a
 rocket motor.


 And the machine worked on ordinary house current, Bob had said.


 Partch had an almost horrifying idea. Suppose....


 But what would Dr. Coles say about this, Partch wondered. Oh, he had to
 get a grip on himself. This was silly, childish....


 But looking down, he found that he had already plugged in the line
 cord. An almost erotic excitement began to shake Joseph's body. The
 sense of disaster had surged up anew, but he didn't recognize it yet.


 An absence of
sound
? No! Silly!


 Then a fire engine came tearing around the corner just below the
 window, filling the office with an ocean of noise.


 Joseph's hand jerked and flicked the switch.


 And then the dream came back to him, the nightmare of the night before
 that had precipitated, unknown to him, his mood of foreboding. It came
 back to him with stark realism and flooded him with unadorned fear.


 In the dream, he had been in a forest. Not just the city park, but a
real
forest, one thousands of miles and centuries away from human
 civilization. A wood in which the foot of Man had never trod.


 It was dark there, and the trees were thick and tall. There was no
 wind, the leaves were soft underfoot. And Joseph Partch was all alone,
completely
alone.


 And it was—quiet.


 Doctor Coles looked at the patient on the white cot sadly.


 ""I've only seen a case like it once before in my entire career, Dr.
 Leeds.""


 Leeds nodded.


 ""It
is
rather rare. Look at him—total catatonia. He's curled into a
 perfect foetal position. Never be the same again, I'm afraid.""


 ""The shock must have been tremendous. An awful psychic blow, especially
 to a person as emotionally disturbed as Mr. Partch was.""


 ""Yes, that machine of Mr. Wills' is extremely dangerous. What amazes
 me is that it didn't kill Partch altogether. Good thing we got to him
 when we did.""


 Dr. Coles rubbed his jaw.


 ""Yes, you know it
is
incredible how much the human mind can sometimes
 take, actually. As you say, it's a wonder it didn't kill him.""


 He shook his head.


 ""Perfectly horrible. How could any modern human stand it? Two hours, he
 was alone with that machine. Imagine—
two hours
of total silence!""

BY STEPHEN BARTHOLOMEW
The noise was too much for him.
 
He wanted quiet—at any price.

When Joseph got to the office his ears were aching from the noise of
 the copter and from his earplugs. Lately, every little thing seemed to
 make him irritable. He supposed it was because his drafting department
 was behind schedule on the latest Defense contract. His ears were sore
 and his stomach writhed with dyspepsia, and his feet hurt.


 Walking through the clerical office usually made him feel better. The
 constant clatter of typewriters and office machines gave him a sense
 of efficiency, of stability, an all-is-well-with-the-world feeling. He
 waved to a few of the more familiar employees and smiled, but of course
 you couldn't say hello with the continual racket.


 This morning, somehow, it didn't make him feel better. He supposed it
 was because of the song they were playing over the speakers, ""Slam Bang
 Boom,"" the latest Top Hit. He hated that song.


 Of course the National Mental Health people said constant music had a
 beneficial effect on office workers, so Joseph was no one to object,
 even though he did wonder if anyone could ever actually listen to it
 over the other noise.


 In his own office the steady din was hardly diminished despite
 soundproofing, and since he was next to an outside wall he was
 subjected also to the noises of the city. He stood staring out of the
 huge window for awhile, watching the cars on the freeway and listening
 to the homogeneous rumble and scream of turbines.
Something's wrong with me
, he thought.
I shouldn't be feeling this
 way. Nerves. Nerves.
He turned around and got his private secretary on the viewer. She
 simpered at him, trying to be friendly with her dull, sunken eyes.


 ""Betty,"" he told her, ""I want you to make an appointment with my
 therapist for me this afternoon. Tell him it's just a case of nerves,
 though.""


 ""Yes sir. Anything else?"" Her voice, like every one's, was a high
 pitched screech trying to be heard above the noise.


 Joseph winced. ""Anybody want to see me this morning?""


 ""Well, Mr. Wills says he has the first model of his invention ready to
 show you.""


 ""Let him in whenever he's ready. Otherwise, if nothing important comes
 up, I want you to leave me alone.""


 ""Yes, sir, certainly."" She smiled again, a mechanical, automatic smile
 that seemed to want to be something more.


 Joseph switched off.
That was a damn funny way of saying it
, he thought.
""I want you to
 leave me alone."" As if somebody were after me.
He spent about an hour on routine paperwork and then Bob Wills showed
 up so Joseph switched off his dictograph and let him in.


 ""I'm afraid you'll have to make it brief, Bob,"" he grinned. ""I've a
 whale of a lot of work to do, and I seem to be developing a splitting
 headache. Nerves, you know.""


 ""Sure, Mister Partch. I won't take a minute; I just thought you'd like
 to have a look at the first model of our widget and get clued in on our
 progress so far....""


 ""Yes, yes, just go ahead. How does the thing work?""


 Bob smiled and set the grey steel chassis on Partch's desk, sat down in
 front of it, and began tracing the wiring for Joseph.


 It was an interesting problem, or at any rate should have been. It
 was one that had been harassing cities, industry, and particularly
 air-fields, for many years. Of course, every one wore earplugs—and
 that helped a little. And some firms had partially solved the problem
 by using personnel that were totally deaf, because such persons
 were the only ones who could stand the terrific noise levels that a
 technological civilization forced everyone to endure. The noise from
 a commercial rocket motor on the ground had been known to drive men
 mad, and sometimes kill them. There had never seemed to be any wholly
 satisfactory solution.


 But now Bob Wills apparently had the beginnings of a real answer. A
 device that would use the principle of interference to cancel out sound
 waves, leaving behind only heat.


 It should have been fascinating to Partch, but somehow he couldn't make
 himself get interested in it.


 ""The really big problem is the power requirement,"" Wills was saying.
 ""We've got to use a lot of energy to cancel out big sound waves, but
 we've got several possible answers in mind and we're working on all of
 them.""


 He caressed the crackle-finish box fondly.


 ""The basic gimmick works fine, though. Yesterday I took it down to a
 static test stand over in building 90 and had them turn on a pretty
 fair-sized steering rocket for one of the big moon-ships. Reduced the
 noise-level by about 25 per cent, it did. Of course, I still needed my
 plugs.""


 Joseph nodded approvingly and stared vacantly into the maze of
 transistors and tubes.


 ""I've built it to work on ordinary 60 cycle house current,"" Wills told
 him. ""In case you should want to demonstrate it to anybody.""


 Partch became brusque. He liked Bob, but he had work to do.


 ""Yes, I probably shall, Bob. I tell you what, why don't you just leave
 it here in my office and I'll look it over later, hm?""


 ""Okay, Mr. Partch.""


 Joseph ushered him out of the office, complimenting him profusely on
 the good work he was doing. Only after he was gone and Joseph was alone
 again behind the closed door, did he realize that he had a sudden
 yearning for company, for someone to talk to.
Partch had Betty send him in a light lunch and he sat behind his desk
 nibbling the tasteless stuff without much enthusiasm. He wondered if he
 was getting an ulcer.


 Yes, he decided, he was going to have to have a long talk with Dr.
 Coles that afternoon. Be a pleasure to get it all off his chest, his
 feeling of melancholia, his latent sense of doom. Be good just to talk
 about it.


 Oh, everything was getting to him these days. He was in a rut, that was
 it. A rut.


 He spat a sesame seed against the far wall and the low whir of the
 automatic vacuum cleaner rose and fell briefly.


 Joseph winced. The speakers were playing ""Slam Bang Boom"" again.


 His mind turned away from the grating melody in self defense, to look
 inward on himself.


 Of what, after all, did Joseph Partch's life consist? He licked his
 fingers and thought about it.


 What would he do this evening after work, for instance?


 Why, he'd stuff his earplugs back in his inflamed ears and board the
 commuter's copter and ride for half an hour listening to the drumming
 of the rotors and the pleading of the various canned commercials played
 on the copter's speakers loud enough to be heard over the engine noise
 and through the plugs.


 And then when he got home, there would be the continuous yammer of his
 wife added to the Tri-Di set going full blast and the dull food from
 the automatic kitchen. And synthetic coffee and one stale cigaret.
 Perhaps a glass of brandy to steady his nerves if Dr. Coles approved.


 Partch brooded. The sense of foreboding had been submerged in the day's
 work, but it was still there. It was as if, any moment, a hydrogen
 bomb were going to be dropped down the chimney, and you had no way of
 knowing when.


 And what would there be to do after he had finished dinner that night?
 Why, the same things he had been doing every night for the past fifteen
 years. There would be Tri-Di first of all. The loud comedians, and the
 musical commercials, and the loud bands, and the commercials, and the
 loud songs....


 And every twenty minutes or so, the viewer would jangle with one of
 Felicia's friends calling up, and more yammering from Felicia.


 Perhaps there would be company that night, to play cards and sip drinks
 and talk and talk and talk, and never say a thing at all.


 There would be aircraft shaking the house now and then, and the cry of
 the monorail horn at intervals.


 And then, at last, it would be time to go to bed, and the murmur of the
 somnolearner orating him on the Theory of Groups all through the long
 night.


 And in the morning, he would be shocked into awareness with the clangor
 of the alarm clock and whatever disc jockey the clock radio happened to
 tune in on.

 Partch got out of his chair and stared out the window again. There was
 a fire over on the East Side, a bad one by the smoke. The fire engines
 went screaming through the streets like wounded dragons. Sirens, bells.
 Police whistles.


 All at once, Partch realized that never in his life had he experienced
 real quiet or solitude. That actually, he had no conception of what an
 absence of thunder and wailing would be like. A total absence of sound

48,"THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT
By MARGARET ST. CLAIR
Being a wizard missionary to
 
the Free'l needed more than
 
magic—it called for a miracle!
[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of If Science Fiction, January 1960.

The spell the Free'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down
 from the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the
 seasons. But, since they had got broor's blood instead of newt's, were
 using alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than
 the solstice anyhow, nothing happened.


 Neeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.


 He'd tried hard with them. The Free'l were really a challenge to
 evangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was
 evinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were
 interested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply
 wouldn't take the trouble to do it right.


 How long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since
 early moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on
 stamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.


 Neeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,
 looked up from his drumming.


 ""Go away,"" he said. ""You'll spoil the charm.""


 ""What charm? Can't you see by now, Rhn, that it isn't going to work?""


 ""Of course it will. It just takes time.""


 ""Hell it will. Hell it does. Watch.""


 Neeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the
 circle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon's
 blood, oil of anointing, and salt.


 He drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon's blood
 at the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with
 the oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,
 which was just coming up, he touched the
outer
cusps with salt. An
 intense smoke sprang up.
When the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in
 the parallelogram.


 ""Tell the demon what you want,"" Neeshan ordered the Free'l.


 The Free'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of
 the things that made teaching them magic difficult.


 ""Two big dyla melons,"" one of the younger ones said at last.


 ""A new andana necklace,"" said another.


 ""A tooter like the one you have,"" said Rhn, who was ambitious.


 ""Straw for a new roof on my hut,"" said one of the older females.


 ""That's enough for now,"" Neeshan interrupted. ""The demon can't bring
 you a tooter, Rhn—you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The
 other things he can get. Sammel, to work!""


 The lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and
 returned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an
 enormous heap of straw.


 ""Can I go now?"" it asked.


 ""Yes."" Neeshan turned to the Free'l, who were sharing the dyla melons
 out around their circle. ""You see?
That's
how it ought to be. You
 cast a spell. You're careful with it. And it works. Right away.""


 ""When you do it, it works,"" Rhn answered.


 ""Magic works when
anybody
does it. But you have to do it right.""


 Rhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. ""It's such a lot
 of dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun."" He walked away,
 munching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.


 Neeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. ""Dreeze"" was a Free'l word that
 referred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race's
 virulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything
 annoying. The Free'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,
 had a lot of colds in the head.


 Wasn't there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest
 spell was too dreezish for them to bother with.


 He was getting a headache. He'd better perform a headache-removing
 spell.


 He retired to the hut the Free'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,
 of course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still
 standing in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big
 black-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint ""woof."" That meant
 headquarters wanted to communicate with him.


 Neeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens
 for focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his
 couch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or
 two he was deep in a cataleptic trance.


 The message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the
 elaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was
 clear enough.


 ""Your report received,"" it boiled down to. ""We are glad to hear that
 you are keeping on with the Free'l. We do not expect you to succeed
 with them—none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever
 has. But if you
should
succeed, by any chance, you would get your
 senior warlock's rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in
 fact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open
 to you.""
Neeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and
 cupidity. His senior warlock's rating—why, he wasn't due to get that
 for nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest
 offices in the Brotherhood—that could mean anything. Anything! He
 hadn't realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the
 Free'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble
 for.


 Neeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists
 pressed against his forehead, and tried to think.


 The Free'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved
 accuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn't want anything.
 That was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He
 had never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free'l express a want.


 Wait, though. There was Rhn.


 He had shown a definite interest in Neeshan's tooter. Something in its
 intricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,
 he hadn't been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to
 extend and develop a magician's spiritual power. He probably thought
 that having it would give him more prestige and influence among his
 people. But for one of the Free'l to say ""I wish I had that"" about
 anything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be
 used as a bribe?


 Neeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A
 tooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician's personality; in
 a sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have
 his tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the
 stakes were enormous.


 Neeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn't want
 to spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.


 Rhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.
 The mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.
 Neeshan came to the point directly.


 ""I'll give you my tooter,"" he said, almost choking over the words, ""if
 you'll do a spell—a simple spell, mind you—exactly right.""


 Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,
 ""Well....""


 Neeshan began his instructions. It wouldn't do for him to help Rhn too
 directly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,
 scratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.


 After Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.
 ""No, don't bother telling me again—it's just more dreeze. Give me the
 materials and I'll show you. Don't forget, you're giving me the tooter
 for this.""
He started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter's hut. While Neeshan
 looked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had
 told him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted
 the order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and
 mispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands
 apart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.


 Neeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. ""Look at that,
 will you!"" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands
 together. ""It worked! I'll take the tooter home with me now.""


 ""The tooter? For
that
? You didn't do the spell right.""


 Rhn stared at him indignantly. ""You mean, you're not going to give me
 the tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,
 really. Neeshan, I think it's very mean of you.""


 ""Try the spell again.""


 ""Oh, dreeze. You're too impatient. You never give anything time to
 work.""


 He got up and walked off.


 For the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They
 all felt sorry for Rhn, who'd worked so hard, done everything he was
 told to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end
 the magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to
 Rhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free'l was
 intolerable.


 But now what was he to do? He'd given up his tooter—he had to ask
 Rhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters—and the
 senior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,
 and all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling
 wretchedly tired out.


 Magic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.
 Neeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable
 than those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for
 help to the magical underworld.


 His thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him
 one thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that
 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the
 most annoying thing they'd encountered in the course of their racial
 history? Good. Fine. Splendid. Then he'd
really
annoy them.


 He'd have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they'd
 turn to magic to get rid of him. They'd have to. And then he'd have
 them. They'd be caught.


 One act of communal magic that really worked and they'd be sold on
 magic. He'd be sure of his senior rating.
Neeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free'l were, there
 was he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical
 objections, and maddening ""wouldn't-it-be-betters.""


 Whereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to
 pointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free'l, he
 now counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,
 from mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until
 they went to bed. He even pursued them with advice
after
they got
 into bed, and told them how to run their sex lives—advice which the
 Free'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,
 resented passionately.


 But most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,
 and instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm—a
 quite simple charm—for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed
 them, work equally well against anything—
or person
—that they found
 annoying.


 The food the Free'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.
 Neeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote
 to poison, around his neck. The Free'l's distaste for him bothered
 him, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the
 anti-annoyance charm to a group of Free'l last night, he had noticed
 that Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn't be much longer now.


 On the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from
 sleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation
 he'd experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,
 and it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.
 Somebody was casting a spell against him.


 At last! At last! It had worked!


 Neeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day
 seemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by
 the spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.


 He began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He
 didn't want the Free'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want
 to have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.
 (He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When
 he was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.


 They were doing it
right
. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his
 chest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind
 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in

48,"THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT
By MARGARET ST. CLAIR
Being a wizard missionary to
 
the Free'l needed more than
 
magic—it called for a miracle!

The spell the Free'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down
 from the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the
 seasons. But, since they had got broor's blood instead of newt's, were
 using alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than
 the solstice anyhow, nothing happened.


 Neeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.


 He'd tried hard with them. The Free'l were really a challenge to
 evangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was
 evinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were
 interested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply
 wouldn't take the trouble to do it right.


 How long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since
 early moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on
 stamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.


 Neeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,
 looked up from his drumming.


 ""Go away,"" he said. ""You'll spoil the charm.""


 ""What charm? Can't you see by now, Rhn, that it isn't going to work?""


 ""Of course it will. It just takes time.""


 ""Hell it will. Hell it does. Watch.""


 Neeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the
 circle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon's
 blood, oil of anointing, and salt.


 He drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon's blood
 at the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with
 the oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,
 which was just coming up, he touched the
outer
cusps with salt. An
 intense smoke sprang up.
When the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in
 the parallelogram.


 ""Tell the demon what you want,"" Neeshan ordered the Free'l.


 The Free'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of
 the things that made teaching them magic difficult.


 ""Two big dyla melons,"" one of the younger ones said at last.


 ""A new andana necklace,"" said another.


 ""A tooter like the one you have,"" said Rhn, who was ambitious.


 ""Straw for a new roof on my hut,"" said one of the older females.


 ""That's enough for now,"" Neeshan interrupted. ""The demon can't bring
 you a tooter, Rhn—you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The
 other things he can get. Sammel, to work!""


 The lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and
 returned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an
 enormous heap of straw.


 ""Can I go now?"" it asked.


 ""Yes."" Neeshan turned to the Free'l, who were sharing the dyla melons
 out around their circle. ""You see?
That's
how it ought to be. You
 cast a spell. You're careful with it. And it works. Right away.""


 ""When you do it, it works,"" Rhn answered.


 ""Magic works when
anybody
does it. But you have to do it right.""


 Rhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. ""It's such a lot
 of dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun."" He walked away,
 munching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.


 Neeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. ""Dreeze"" was a Free'l word that
 referred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race's
 virulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything
 annoying. The Free'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,
 had a lot of colds in the head.


 Wasn't there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest
 spell was too dreezish for them to bother with.


 He was getting a headache. He'd better perform a headache-removing
 spell.


 He retired to the hut the Free'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,
 of course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still
 standing in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big
 black-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint ""woof."" That meant
 headquarters wanted to communicate with him.


 Neeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens
 for focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his
 couch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or
 two he was deep in a cataleptic trance.


 The message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the
 elaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was
 clear enough.


 ""Your report received,"" it boiled down to. ""We are glad to hear that
 you are keeping on with the Free'l. We do not expect you to succeed
 with them—none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever
 has. But if you
should
succeed, by any chance, you would get your
 senior warlock's rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in
 fact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open
 to you.""
Neeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and
 cupidity. His senior warlock's rating—why, he wasn't due to get that
 for nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest
 offices in the Brotherhood—that could mean anything. Anything! He
 hadn't realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the
 Free'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble
 for.


 Neeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists
 pressed against his forehead, and tried to think.


 The Free'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved
 accuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn't want anything.
 That was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He
 had never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free'l express a want.


 Wait, though. There was Rhn.


 He had shown a definite interest in Neeshan's tooter. Something in its
 intricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,
 he hadn't been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to
 extend and develop a magician's spiritual power. He probably thought
 that having it would give him more prestige and influence among his
 people. But for one of the Free'l to say ""I wish I had that"" about
 anything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be
 used as a bribe?


 Neeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A
 tooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician's personality; in
 a sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have
 his tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the
 stakes were enormous.


 Neeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn't want
 to spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.


 Rhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.
 The mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.
 Neeshan came to the point directly.


 ""I'll give you my tooter,"" he said, almost choking over the words, ""if
 you'll do a spell—a simple spell, mind you—exactly right.""


 Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,
 ""Well....""


 Neeshan began his instructions. It wouldn't do for him to help Rhn too
 directly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,
 scratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.


 After Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.
 ""No, don't bother telling me again—it's just more dreeze. Give me the
 materials and I'll show you. Don't forget, you're giving me the tooter
 for this.""
He started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter's hut. While Neeshan
 looked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had
 told him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted
 the order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and
 mispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands
 apart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.


 Neeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. ""Look at that,
 will you!"" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands
 together. ""It worked! I'll take the tooter home with me now.""


 ""The tooter? For
that
? You didn't do the spell right.""


 Rhn stared at him indignantly. ""You mean, you're not going to give me
 the tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,
 really. Neeshan, I think it's very mean of you.""


 ""Try the spell again.""


 ""Oh, dreeze. You're too impatient. You never give anything time to
 work.""


 He got up and walked off.


 For the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They
 all felt sorry for Rhn, who'd worked so hard, done everything he was
 told to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end
 the magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to
 Rhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free'l was
 intolerable.


 But now what was he to do? He'd given up his tooter—he had to ask
 Rhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters—and the
 senior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,
 and all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling
 wretchedly tired out.


 Magic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.
 Neeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable
 than those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for
 help to the magical underworld.


 His thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him
 one thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that
 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the
 most annoying thing they'd encountered in the course of their racial
 history? Good. Fine. Splendid. Then he'd
really
annoy them.


 He'd have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they'd
 turn to magic to get rid of him. They'd have to. And then he'd have
 them. They'd be caught.


 One act of communal magic that really worked and they'd be sold on
 magic. He'd be sure of his senior rating.
Neeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free'l were, there
 was he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical
 objections, and maddening ""wouldn't-it-be-betters.""


 Whereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to
 pointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free'l, he
 now counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,
 from mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until
 they went to bed. He even pursued them with advice
after
they got
 into bed, and told them how to run their sex lives—advice which the
 Free'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,
 resented passionately.


 But most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,
 and instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm—a
 quite simple charm—for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed
 them, work equally well against anything—
or person
—that they found
 annoying.


 The food the Free'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.
 Neeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote
 to poison, around his neck. The Free'l's distaste for him bothered
 him, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the
 anti-annoyance charm to a group of Free'l last night, he had noticed
 that Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn't be much longer now.


 On the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from
 sleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation
 he'd experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,
 and it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.
 Somebody was casting a spell against him.


 At last! At last! It had worked!


 Neeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day
 seemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by
 the spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.


 He began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He
 didn't want the Free'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want
 to have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.
 (He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When
 he was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.


 They were doing it
right
. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his
 chest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind
 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
 the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
 while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
 alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
 when they do their magic dances.


 They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
 him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
 the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.

 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
 the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
 while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
 alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
 when they do their magic dances.


 They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
 him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
 the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.
",3,Neeshan's motivation to teach the Free'l magic is,2,strictly selfish.  ,3,because he wants to change their apathetic state of mind.
48,"THE AUTUMN AFTER NEXT
By MARGARET ST. CLAIR
Being a wizard missionary to
 
the Free'l needed more than
 
magic—it called for a miracle!

The spell the Free'l were casting ought to have drawn the moon down
 from the heavens, made water run uphill, and inverted the order of the
 seasons. But, since they had got broor's blood instead of newt's, were
 using alganon instead of vervet juice, and were three days later than
 the solstice anyhow, nothing happened.


 Neeshan watched their antics with a bitter smile.


 He'd tried hard with them. The Free'l were really a challenge to
 evangelical wizardry. They had some natural talent for magic, as was
 evinced by the frequent attempts they made to perform it, and they were
 interested in what he told them about its capacities. But they simply
 wouldn't take the trouble to do it right.


 How long had they been stamping around in their circle, anyhow? Since
 early moonset, and it was now almost dawn. No doubt they would go on
 stamping all next day, if not interrupted. It was time to call a halt.


 Neeshan strode into the middle of the circle. Rhn, the village chief,
 looked up from his drumming.


 ""Go away,"" he said. ""You'll spoil the charm.""


 ""What charm? Can't you see by now, Rhn, that it isn't going to work?""


 ""Of course it will. It just takes time.""


 ""Hell it will. Hell it does. Watch.""


 Neeshan pushed Rhn to one side and squatted down in the center of the
 circle. From the pockets of his black robe he produced stylus, dragon's
 blood, oil of anointing, and salt.


 He drew a design on the ground with the stylus, dropped dragon's blood
 at the corners of the parallelogram, and touched the inner cusps with
 the oil. Then, sighting carefully at the double red and white sun,
 which was just coming up, he touched the
outer
cusps with salt. An
 intense smoke sprang up.
When the smoke died away, a small lizardlike creature was visible in
 the parallelogram.


 ""Tell the demon what you want,"" Neeshan ordered the Free'l.


 The Free'l hesitated. They had few wants, after all, which was one of
 the things that made teaching them magic difficult.


 ""Two big dyla melons,"" one of the younger ones said at last.


 ""A new andana necklace,"" said another.


 ""A tooter like the one you have,"" said Rhn, who was ambitious.


 ""Straw for a new roof on my hut,"" said one of the older females.


 ""That's enough for now,"" Neeshan interrupted. ""The demon can't bring
 you a tooter, Rhn—you have to ask another sort of demon for that. The
 other things he can get. Sammel, to work!""


 The lizard in the parallelogram twitched its tail. It disappeared, and
 returned almost immediately with melons, a handsome necklace, and an
 enormous heap of straw.


 ""Can I go now?"" it asked.


 ""Yes."" Neeshan turned to the Free'l, who were sharing the dyla melons
 out around their circle. ""You see?
That's
how it ought to be. You
 cast a spell. You're careful with it. And it works. Right away.""


 ""When you do it, it works,"" Rhn answered.


 ""Magic works when
anybody
does it. But you have to do it right.""


 Rhn raised his mud-plastered shoulders in a shrug. ""It's such a lot
 of dreeze, doing it that way. Magic ought to be fun."" He walked away,
 munching on a slice of the melon the demon had brought.


 Neeshan stared after him, his eyes hot. ""Dreeze"" was a Free'l word that
 referred originally to the nasal drip that accompanied that race's
 virulent head colds. It had been extended to mean almost anything
 annoying. The Free'l, who spent much of their time sitting in the rain,
 had a lot of colds in the head.


 Wasn't there anything to be done with these people? Even the simplest
 spell was too dreezish for them to bother with.


 He was getting a headache. He'd better perform a headache-removing
 spell.


 He retired to the hut the Free'l had assigned to him. The spell worked,
 of course, but it left him feeling soggy and dispirited. He was still
 standing in the hut, wondering what he should do next, when his big
 black-and-gold tooter in the corner gave a faint ""woof."" That meant
 headquarters wanted to communicate with him.


 Neeshan carefully aligned the tooter, which is basically a sort of lens
 for focusing neural force, with the rising double suns. He moved his
 couch out into a parallel position and lay down on it. In a minute or
 two he was deep in a cataleptic trance.


 The message from headquarters was long, circuitous, and couched in the
 elaborate, ego-caressing ceremonial of high magic, but its gist was
 clear enough.


 ""Your report received,"" it boiled down to. ""We are glad to hear that
 you are keeping on with the Free'l. We do not expect you to succeed
 with them—none of the other magical missionaries we have sent out ever
 has. But if you
should
succeed, by any chance, you would get your
 senior warlock's rating immediately. It would be no exaggeration, in
 fact, to say that the highest offices in the Brotherhood would be open
 to you.""
Neeshan came out of his trance. His eyes were round with wonder and
 cupidity. His senior warlock's rating—why, he wasn't due to get that
 for nearly four more six hundred-and-five-day years. And the highest
 offices in the Brotherhood—that could mean anything. Anything! He
 hadn't realized the Brotherhood set such store on converting the
 Free'l. Well, now, a reward like that was worth going to some trouble
 for.


 Neeshan sat down on his couch, his elbows on his knees, his fists
 pressed against his forehead, and tried to think.


 The Free'l liked magic, but they were lazy. Anything that involved
 accuracy impressed them as dreezish. And they didn't want anything.
 That was the biggest difficulty. Magic had nothing to offer them. He
 had never, Neeshan thought, heard one of the Free'l express a want.


 Wait, though. There was Rhn.


 He had shown a definite interest in Neeshan's tooter. Something in its
 intricate, florid black-and-gold curves seemed to fascinate him. True,
 he hadn't been interested in it for its legitimate uses, which were to
 extend and develop a magician's spiritual power. He probably thought
 that having it would give him more prestige and influence among his
 people. But for one of the Free'l to say ""I wish I had that"" about
 anything whatever meant that he could be worked on. Could the tooter be
 used as a bribe?


 Neeshan sighed heavily. Getting a tooter was painful and laborious. A
 tooter was carefully fitted to an individual magician's personality; in
 a sense, it was a part of his personality, and if Neeshan let Rhn have
 his tooter, he would be letting him have a part of himself. But the
 stakes were enormous.


 Neeshan got up from his couch. It had begun to rain, but he didn't want
 to spend time performing a rain-repelling spell. He wanted to find Rhn.


 Rhn was standing at the edge of the swamp, luxuriating in the downpour.
 The mud had washed from his shoulders, and he was already sniffling.
 Neeshan came to the point directly.


 ""I'll give you my tooter,"" he said, almost choking over the words, ""if
 you'll do a spell—a simple spell, mind you—exactly right.""


 Rhn hesitated. Neeshan felt an impulse to kick him. Then he said,
 ""Well....""


 Neeshan began his instructions. It wouldn't do for him to help Rhn too
 directly, but he was willing to do everything reasonable. Rhn listened,
 scratching himself in the armpits and sneezing from time to time.


 After Neeshan had been through the directions twice, Rhn stopped him.
 ""No, don't bother telling me again—it's just more dreeze. Give me the
 materials and I'll show you. Don't forget, you're giving me the tooter
 for this.""
He started off, Neeshan after him, to the latter's hut. While Neeshan
 looked on tensely, Rhn began going through the actions Neeshan had
 told him. Half-way through the first decad, he forgot. He inverted
 the order of the hand-passes, sprinkled salt on the wrong point, and
 mispronounced the names in the invocation. When he pulled his hands
 apart at the end, only a tiny yellow flame sprang up.


 Neeshan cursed bitterly. Rhn, however, was delighted. ""Look at that,
 will you!"" he exclaimed, clapping his chapped, scabby little hands
 together. ""It worked! I'll take the tooter home with me now.""


 ""The tooter? For
that
? You didn't do the spell right.""


 Rhn stared at him indignantly. ""You mean, you're not going to give me
 the tooter after all the trouble I went to? I only did it as a favor,
 really. Neeshan, I think it's very mean of you.""


 ""Try the spell again.""


 ""Oh, dreeze. You're too impatient. You never give anything time to
 work.""


 He got up and walked off.


 For the next few days, everybody in the village avoided Neeshan. They
 all felt sorry for Rhn, who'd worked so hard, done everything he was
 told to, and been cheated out of his tooter by Neeshan. In the end
 the magician, cursing his own weakness, surrendered the tooter to
 Rhn. The accusatory atmosphere in the normally indifferent Free'l was
 intolerable.


 But now what was he to do? He'd given up his tooter—he had to ask
 Rhn to lend it to him when he wanted to contact headquarters—and the
 senior rating was no nearer than before. His head ached constantly,
 and all the spells he performed to cure the pain left him feeling
 wretchedly tired out.


 Magic, however, is an art of many resources, not all of them savory.
 Neeshan, in his desperation, began to invoke demons more disreputable
 than those he would ordinarily have consulted. In effect, he turned for
 help to the magical underworld.


 His thuggish informants were none too consistent. One demon told him
 one thing, another something else. The consensus, though, was that
 while there was nothing the Free'l actually wanted enough to go to any
 trouble for it (they didn't even want to get rid of their nasal drip,
 for example—in a perverse way they were proud of it), there
was
one
 thing they disliked intensely—Neeshan himself.


 The Free'l thought, the demons reported, that he was inconsiderate,
 tactless, officious, and a crashing bore. They regarded him as the
 psychological equivalent of the worst case of dreeze ever known,
 carried to the nth power. They wished he'd drop dead or hang himself.


 Neeshan dismissed the last of the demons. His eyes had begun to shine.
 The Free'l thought he was a nuisance, did they? They thought he was the
 most annoying thing they'd encountered in the course of their racial
 history? Good. Fine. Splendid. Then he'd
really
annoy them.


 He'd have to watch out for poison, of course. But in the end, they'd
 turn to magic to get rid of him. They'd have to. And then he'd have
 them. They'd be caught.


 One act of communal magic that really worked and they'd be sold on
 magic. He'd be sure of his senior rating.
Neeshan began his campaign immediately. Where the Free'l were, there
 was he. He was always on hand with unwanted explanations, hypercritical
 objections, and maddening ""wouldn't-it-be-betters.""


 Whereas earlier in his evangelical mission he had confined himself to
 pointing out how much easier magic would make life for the Free'l, he
 now counciled and advised them on every phase of their daily routine,
 from mud-smearing to rain-sitting, and from the time they got up until
 they went to bed. He even pursued them with advice
after
they got
 into bed, and told them how to run their sex lives—advice which the
 Free'l, who set quite as much store by their sex lives as anybody does,
 resented passionately.


 But most of all he harped on their folly in putting up with nasal drip,
 and instructed them over and over again in the details of a charm—a
 quite simple charm—for getting rid of it. The charm would, he informed
 them, work equally well against anything—
or person
—that they found
 annoying.


 The food the Free'l brought him began to have a highly peculiar taste.
 Neeshan grinned and hung a theriacal charm, a first-class antidote
 to poison, around his neck. The Free'l's distaste for him bothered
 him, naturally, but he could stand it. When he had repeated the
 anti-annoyance charm to a group of Free'l last night, he had noticed
 that Rhn was listening eagerly. It wouldn't be much longer now.


 On the morning of the day before the equinox, Neeshan was awakened from
 sleep by an odd prickling sensation in his ears. It was a sensation
 he'd experienced only once before in his life, during his novitiate,
 and it took him a moment to identify it. Then he realized what it was.
 Somebody was casting a spell against him.


 At last! At last! It had worked!


 Neeshan put on his robe and hurried to the door of the hut. The day
 seemed remarkably overcast, almost like night, but that was caused by
 the spell. This one happened to involve the optic nerves.


 He began to grope his way cautiously toward the village center. He
 didn't want the Free'l to see him and get suspicious, but he did want
 to have the pleasure of seeing them cast their first accurate spell.
 (He was well protected against wind-damage from it, of course.) When
 he was almost at the center, he took cover behind a hut. He peered out.


 They were doing it
right
. Oh, what a satisfaction! Neeshan felt his
 chest expand with pride. And when the spell worked, when the big wind
 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He

The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in

 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.

 swooped down and blew him away, the Free'l would certainly receive a
 second magical missionary more kindly. Neeshan might even come back,
 well disguised, himself.


 The ritual went on. The dancers made three circles to the left,
 three circles to the right. Cross over, and all sprinkle salt on the
 interstices of the star Rhn had traced on the ground with the point of
 a knife. Back to the circle. One to the left, one to right, while Rhn,
 in the center of the circle, dusted over the salt with—with
what
?


 ""Hey!"" Neeshan yelled in sudden alarm. ""Not brimstone! Watch out!
 You're not doing it ri—""


 His chest contracted suddenly, as if a large, stony hand had seized
 his thorax above the waist. He couldn't breathe, he couldn't think,
 he couldn't even say ""Ouch!"" It felt as if his chest—no, his whole
 body—was being compressed in on itself and turning into something as
 hard as stone.


 He tried to wave his tiny, heavy arms in a counter-charm; he couldn't
 even inhale. The last emotion he experienced was one of bitterness. He
 might have
known
the Free'l couldn't get anything right.
The Free'l take a dim view of the small stone image that now stands in
 the center of their village. It is much too heavy for them to move, and
 while it is not nearly so much of a nuisance as Neeshan was when he was
 alive, it inconveniences them. They have to make a detour around it
 when they do their magic dances.


 They still hope, though, that the spells they are casting to get rid of
 him will work eventually. If he doesn't go away this autumn, he will
 the autumn after next. They have a good deal of faith in magic, when
 you come right down to it. And patience is their long suit.

49,"Going off track
Birmingham's airport isn't like other airports. Right at the north-western end of runway 15 there's a country park and a row of benches. You'll see families picnicking here, enjoying the subsonic spectacle of planes from Brussels, Bucharest and Barcelona roaring just feet overhead on their final approach. Birmingham isn't like other British cities – it fetishises the technical and promotes the new. It is unstinting in its thrall to evolution and unsentimental about erasing past versions of the future in its rush to create new ones; the comprehensive 1960s vision of the city which itself swept away a century's Victoriana is currently being meticulously taken apart concrete slab by concrete slab. The city's motto is 'Forward'. 

 When you get to a certain age you realise how much more visions of the future say about the present they're concocted in than the actual future they purport to show us hurtling towards. A track in the air, sitting on top of concrete legs that couldn't look any more like rational new humans striding into a technocratic promised land if they tried, will always evoke a kind of nostalgia for the 20th century. You think of the SAFEGE monorail depicted in Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of Fahrenheit 451; and of regional news reporters with greasy barnets delivering excited pieces to camera about big plans. 

 Today, on the elevated track that gambols over windswept car parks and threads through cheap motels between Birmingham's airport terminal and the railway station, a simple, ski resort-style people-mover system ferries passengers from plane to train. Three decades ago it was so much more exciting: the world's first commercial maglev, or magnetic levitation, system ran along here.
Opened in 1984, the Birmingham Maglev came at the very tail end of a
trente glorieuses
for British transport technology and, more broadly, European engineering; an era that promised so much yet eventually bequeathed so many relics and ruins. 

 The modernism of the 20th century, expressed especially in architecture and engineering, seemed like nothing less than the founding of a new order. Progress was to be continual, unstoppable and good. Yet today the physical and philosophical advances are being gradually taken apart and retracted, as if we'd woken up sweating and feared we'd somehow overreached ourselves.  

 When the Birmingham Maglev was shuttered in 1995, one of the cars was dumped in a hedge near the A45. Furniture maker and transport enthusiast Andy Jones splashed out a mere £100 for it on eBay in 2011 (although, he says, ""it cost me £400 to get it out of the hedge!""). Now it sits in a field behind Jones's house in Burton Green, a couple of miles east of the airport in the rolling Warwickshire countryside.
I reminisce to Jones about my boyhood excitement for the Birmingham Maglev, about the silly enthusiasm I felt when I got to go on it in the late 80s. He shared the experience. ""I used it in the old days too,"" he says. ""I'd ride backwards and forwards on it, I thought it was smashing."" 

 ""The problem was, it was the end of one lot of technology. The first time it snowed, all hell broke loose! It had a ratcheting mechanism, a primitive form of winch. Beneath that was the hydraulic system. It was lifted up by the magnetic field (under the [car] are steel sheets). But you'd use the hydraulic system to pull it back up on to the system if it broke."" 

 Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the National Rail Museum in York, says: ""British Rail's Derby Research Centre, founded in 1964, was arguably the world's leading rail research facility when it was in full operation. An understanding of the wheel and rail interface comes from there, as does the first tilting train, a new railbus, high-speed freight wagons, computer-controlled interlocking of track and signal, the first successful maglev and many other things."" Gwynne has got the second of the three Birmingham Maglev cars at the museum.
The maglev was a development that spun out of this research at Derby, and developed in a joint project with a private consortium that included the now-defunct General Electric Company. The maglev cars were built by Metro Cammell at its factory four miles from the airport in Washwood Heath. It was the same place many tube carriages came from, and if you look down the doors on Piccadilly line carriages as you get on and off, you can see a cheery 1973 plaque reminding travellers of this fact (the cheeky Brummie assumption here being that London commuters always look at the floor). 

 But the British maglev never really took off. Tim Dunn, transport historian and co-presenter of the BBC's Trainspotting Live, explains why. ""The early 80s was still a time of great British national-funded engineering,"" he says. ""Success at Birmingham Airport would have been a great advert for British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) to sell maglev internationally. (Remember that BREL was always trying to sell its technology overseas, which is why several Pacer trains, developed on bus bodies, were sold to Iran.) Birmingham's Maglev only lasted 11 years: replacement parts were getting hard to obtain for what was really a unique system. Buses took over, and eventually a cable-hauled SkyRail people-mover was installed atop the piers. That's not as exciting for people like me, who like the idea of being whisked in a hovertrain pushed along by magnets. But then our real transport future always has been a pretty crap approximation of our dreams.""
You don't have to look far to find other relics of this white-hot time when post-war confidence begat all sorts of oddities. There's the test track for the French Aerotrain outside Orleans – a rocket-powered prototype that never made it to middle age. And in Emsland, the German conglomerate Transrapid built a 32km supersized test track for their maglev, which seemed to be on course for success. A variation of this train shuttles passengers from Shanghai to the airport, and the plan was to copy the same model in Munich, and even build an intercity line from Berlin to Hamburg. Today the test track stands idle awaiting its fate, while the Transrapid vehicles are up for auction; a museum in Erfurt is trying to save the latter from the scrapyard. Little remains of Germany's other maglev, the M-Bahn (or Magnetbahn), a short-lived shuttle service that ran in West Berlin from 1989-91 connecting stations whose service had been previously severed by the Berlin Wall. With the Wall gone, the old U-Bahn service was reinstated and the M-Bahn, which had run along its tracks, disappeared from the capital of the new Germany. 

 ""The problem with high-speed maglev like Transrapid in Germany,"" says Tim Dunn, ""is that it doesn't really stack up against high-speed rail. It's more expensive, it's lower capacity, it's more complex. There's a gap in the market, but there's no market in the gap. What is needed generally in mass transit is more capacity, rather than super high speed.""
But back in the post-war period, we thought we could have everything. Britain's tertiary science departments expanded. We built the Comet jetliner, then Concorde; and concrete buildings to house them that the world envied, like the huge Heathrow hangar that Sir Owen Williams, primarily an engineer, designed for BOAC's planes; and architect James Stirling's much-lauded engineering faculty at Leicester University. Yet a little-known footnote from this period involves the interaction of magnets in high-speed train design with that other British invention that prevailed for a while but then seemed to peter out: the hovercraft. 

 ""We have always wanted to get rid of wheels,"" says Railworld's Brian Pearce. ""One invention [to this end] was Chris Cockerell's hovercraft."" At the same time, maglev technology was being developed by the British inventor, Eric Laithwaite, who was working on the linear induction motor at Imperial College when he found a way for it to produce lift as well as forward thrust. The two systems were combined to form a tracked hovercraft. ""So along came RTV31,"" says Pearce. ""The train rode along the track on a cushion of air created by big electric fans. Not very energy efficient! The forward motion was created by a linear motor, which moved along rather than going round and round.""
RTV31 could, like France's Aérotrain or the German Transrapid system, have been a viable new form of intercity travel. But funding was insufficient throughout the project and eventually Britain pulled the plug. In February 1973, a week after the first test RTV31 hovertrain reached 157km/h, the project was abandoned as part of wider budget cuts. 

 There's an eerie reminder of the RTV31 in the big-skied, liminal lands of East Anglia. The train was tested on a track that ran up alongside the New Bedford River at Earith in Cambridgeshire: appropriate, because this 'river' is actually a supreme piece of man-made engineering from an earlier age, a dead-straight dyke dug by Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden to drain the fens in the 1600s. The RTV31 test-track piers endure as further reminders of a past future. The vehicle itself sits not far away at Peterborough's Railworld, where its colourful exterior is strikingly visible to today's travellers on the East Coast Main Line from London to Scotland. Its neighbour is the final redundant Birmingham Maglev car.
In the far east, attitudes to maglev are different. Japan began maglev testing at roughly the same time as Britain in 1962 and is today building the longest, fastest maglev in the world. It will run mostly in tunnel, at 500km/h, taking a shocking 40 minutes to travel the 300km between Tokyo and Nagoya. It's been christened the Chūō Shinkansen: just another, faster type of bullet train for the central districts. Japan's system is a superconducting maglev, different to the Birmingham and German systems. It uses superconducting coils in the train, which cause repulsion to move the train forward. The Japanese also use wheels for the vehicle to 'land' on the track at low speeds. 

 It's understandable that most serious interest in maglev deployment is in Asia – Japan, China, India,"" says John Harding, former chief maglev scientist for the US Department of Transportation. ""This is understandable wherever passenger traffic is huge and can dilute the enormous capital cost. (Maglev is indisputably more expensive upfront than high-speed rail.) Even for California, which has huge air passenger traffic between LA and San Francisco, there is nowhere near enough demand to justify maglev; probably not enough to justify high-speed rail. But the Chūō Shinkansen will probably be the greatest success for maglev."" The first link between Tokyo and Nagoya is scheduled to begin operation in 2027. Then the Chinese are proposing a 600km/h system between Shanghai and Beijing.
So there are still some people dreaming big. The latest iteration of this is of course Hyperloop, whose vacuum tube technology harks back to another British engineering innovation: the atmospheric railway, which was developed by Henry Pinkus, the Samuda Brothers and eventually by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. This technology used varying air pressure to suck trains up a track in a partial vacuum. Lines popped up in London, Dublin and most notably Brunel's South Devon Railway, where the pipes were plagued by nibbling rats but the pumping stations survive as relics of Victorian visionaries. If those systems looked like something from HG Wells, with men in top hats smoking cigars, then Hyperloop, with its internet age funding from Tesla founder Elon Musk, could well end up appearing as a very 2010s caper when we look at back on it from the distance of decades. Or maybe Hyperloop will revolutionise travel like maglev was supposed to. 

 Back in Burton Green, Andy Jones's maglev car lies in limbo. ""I'd like to build a platform around it,"" he says, ""turn it into a playhouse for the grandchildren perhaps? A couple of people want to take it away and turn it into a cafe."" Perversely perhaps, its fate may be decided by another type of transport technology: more conventional high speed rail. The route for the much-disputed High Speed 2 line from London to Birmingham slices right through the field where the maglev car sits.  

 In the 2000s the UK Ultraspeed proposal was floated to link London, Birmingham, the North and Scotland by maglev. It never materialised. HS2 was the eventual successor to the Ultraspeed plan, though a less futuristic one. Jones has another idea for his forward moving relic: ""Maybe I'll turn it into viewing platform, so you could watch HS2's outdated technology.""

With the Wall gone, the old U-Bahn service was reinstated and the M-Bahn, which had run along its tracks, disappeared from the capital of the new Germany. 

 ""The problem with high-speed maglev like Transrapid in Germany,"" says Tim Dunn, ""is that it doesn't really stack up against high-speed rail. It's more expensive, it's lower capacity, it's more complex. There's a gap in the market, but there's no market in the gap. What is needed generally in mass transit is more capacity, rather than super high speed.""
But back in the post-war period, we thought we could have everything. Britain's tertiary science departments expanded. We built the Comet jetliner, then Concorde; and concrete buildings to house them that the world envied, like the huge Heathrow hangar that Sir Owen Williams, primarily an engineer, designed for BOAC's planes; and architect James Stirling's much-lauded engineering faculty at Leicester University. Yet a little-known footnote from this period involves the interaction of magnets in high-speed train design with that other British invention that prevailed for a while but then seemed to peter out: the hovercraft. 

 ""We have always wanted to get rid of wheels,"" says Railworld's Brian Pearce. ""One invention [to this end] was Chris Cockerell's hovercraft."" At the same time, maglev technology was being developed by the British inventor, Eric Laithwaite, who was working on the linear induction motor at Imperial College when he found a way for it to produce lift as well as forward thrust. The two systems were combined to form a tracked hovercraft. ""So along came RTV31,"" says Pearce. ""The train rode along the track on a cushion of air created by big electric fans. Not very energy efficient! The forward motion was created by a linear motor, which moved along rather than going round and round.""
RTV31 could, like France's Aérotrain or the German Transrapid system, have been a viable new form of intercity travel. But funding was insufficient throughout the project and eventually Britain pulled the plug. In February 1973, a week after the first test RTV31 hovertrain reached 157km/h, the project was abandoned as part of wider budget cuts. 

 There's an eerie reminder of the RTV31 in the big-skied, liminal lands of East Anglia. The train was tested on a track that ran up alongside the New Bedford River at Earith in Cambridgeshire: appropriate, because this 'river' is actually a supreme piece of man-made engineering from an earlier age, a dead-straight dyke dug by Dutchman Cornelius Vermuyden to drain the fens in the 1600s. The RTV31 test-track piers endure as further reminders of a past future. The vehicle itself sits not far away at Peterborough's Railworld, where its colourful exterior is strikingly visible to today's travellers on the East Coast Main Line from London to Scotland. Its neighbour is the final redundant Birmingham Maglev car.
In the far east, attitudes to maglev are different. Japan began maglev testing at roughly the same time as Britain in 1962 and is today building the longest, fastest maglev in the world. It will run mostly in tunnel, at 500km/h, taking a shocking 40 minutes to travel the 300km between Tokyo and Nagoya. It's been christened the Chūō Shinkansen: just another, faster type of bullet train for the central districts. Japan's system is a superconducting maglev, different to the Birmingham and German systems. It uses superconducting coils in the train, which cause repulsion to move the train forward. The Japanese also use wheels for the vehicle to 'land' on the track at low speeds. 

 It's understandable that most serious interest in maglev deployment is in Asia – Japan, China, India,"" says John Harding, former chief maglev scientist for the US Department of Transportation. ""This is understandable wherever passenger traffic is huge and can dilute the enormous capital cost. (Maglev is indisputably more expensive upfront than high-speed rail.) Even for California, which has huge air passenger traffic between LA and San Francisco, there is nowhere near enough demand to justify maglev; probably not enough to justify high-speed rail. But the Chūō Shinkansen will probably be the greatest success for maglev."" The first link between Tokyo and Nagoya is scheduled to begin operation in 2027. Then the Chinese are proposing a 600km/h system between Shanghai and Beijing.
So there are still some people dreaming big. The latest iteration of this is of course Hyperloop, whose vacuum tube technology harks back to another British engineering innovation: the atmospheric railway, which was developed by Henry Pinkus, the Samuda Brothers and eventually by Isambard Kingdom Brunel. This technology used varying air pressure to suck trains up a track in a partial vacuum. Lines popped up in London, Dublin and most notably Brunel's South Devon Railway, where the pipes were plagued by nibbling rats but the pumping stations survive as relics of Victorian visionaries. If those systems looked like something from HG Wells, with men in top hats smoking cigars, then Hyperloop, with its internet age funding from Tesla founder Elon Musk, could well end up appearing as a very 2010s caper when we look at back on it from the distance of decades. Or maybe Hyperloop will revolutionise travel like maglev was supposed to. 

 Back in Burton Green, Andy Jones's maglev car lies in limbo. ""I'd like to build a platform around it,"" he says, ""turn it into a playhouse for the grandchildren perhaps? A couple of people want to take it away and turn it into a cafe."" Perversely perhaps, its fate may be decided by another type of transport technology: more conventional high speed rail. The route for the much-disputed High Speed 2 line from London to Birmingham slices right through the field where the maglev car sits.  

 In the 2000s the UK Ultraspeed proposal was floated to link London, Birmingham, the North and Scotland by maglev. It never materialised. HS2 was the eventual successor to the Ultraspeed plan, though a less futuristic one. Jones has another idea for his forward moving relic: ""Maybe I'll turn it into viewing platform, so you could watch HS2's outdated technology.""

49,"Going off track
Birmingham's airport isn't like other airports. Right at the north-western end of runway 15 there's a country park and a row of benches. You'll see families picnicking here, enjoying the subsonic spectacle of planes from Brussels, Bucharest and Barcelona roaring just feet overhead on their final approach. Birmingham isn't like other British cities – it fetishises the technical and promotes the new. It is unstinting in its thrall to evolution and unsentimental about erasing past versions of the future in its rush to create new ones; the comprehensive 1960s vision of the city which itself swept away a century's Victoriana is currently being meticulously taken apart concrete slab by concrete slab. The city's motto is 'Forward'. 

 When you get to a certain age you realise how much more visions of the future say about the present they're concocted in than the actual future they purport to show us hurtling towards. A track in the air, sitting on top of concrete legs that couldn't look any more like rational new humans striding into a technocratic promised land if they tried, will always evoke a kind of nostalgia for the 20th century. You think of the SAFEGE monorail depicted in Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation of Fahrenheit 451; and of regional news reporters with greasy barnets delivering excited pieces to camera about big plans. 

 Today, on the elevated track that gambols over windswept car parks and threads through cheap motels between Birmingham's airport terminal and the railway station, a simple, ski resort-style people-mover system ferries passengers from plane to train. Three decades ago it was so much more exciting: the world's first commercial maglev, or magnetic levitation, system ran along here.
Opened in 1984, the Birmingham Maglev came at the very tail end of a
trente glorieuses
for British transport technology and, more broadly, European engineering; an era that promised so much yet eventually bequeathed so many relics and ruins. 

 The modernism of the 20th century, expressed especially in architecture and engineering, seemed like nothing less than the founding of a new order. Progress was to be continual, unstoppable and good. Yet today the physical and philosophical advances are being gradually taken apart and retracted, as if we'd woken up sweating and feared we'd somehow overreached ourselves.  

 When the Birmingham Maglev was shuttered in 1995, one of the cars was dumped in a hedge near the A45. Furniture maker and transport enthusiast Andy Jones splashed out a mere £100 for it on eBay in 2011 (although, he says, ""it cost me £400 to get it out of the hedge!""). Now it sits in a field behind Jones's house in Burton Green, a couple of miles east of the airport in the rolling Warwickshire countryside.
I reminisce to Jones about my boyhood excitement for the Birmingham Maglev, about the silly enthusiasm I felt when I got to go on it in the late 80s. He shared the experience. ""I used it in the old days too,"" he says. ""I'd ride backwards and forwards on it, I thought it was smashing."" 

 ""The problem was, it was the end of one lot of technology. The first time it snowed, all hell broke loose! It had a ratcheting mechanism, a primitive form of winch. Beneath that was the hydraulic system. It was lifted up by the magnetic field (under the [car] are steel sheets). But you'd use the hydraulic system to pull it back up on to the system if it broke."" 

 Bob Gwynne, associate curator of collections and research at the National Rail Museum in York, says: ""British Rail's Derby Research Centre, founded in 1964, was arguably the world's leading rail research facility when it was in full operation. An understanding of the wheel and rail interface comes from there, as does the first tilting train, a new railbus, high-speed freight wagons, computer-controlled interlocking of track and signal, the first successful maglev and many other things."" Gwynne has got the second of the three Birmingham Maglev cars at the museum.
The maglev was a development that spun out of this research at Derby, and developed in a joint project with a private consortium that included the now-defunct General Electric Company. The maglev cars were built by Metro Cammell at its factory four miles from the airport in Washwood Heath. It was the same place many tube carriages came from, and if you look down the doors on Piccadilly line carriages as you get on and off, you can see a cheery 1973 plaque reminding travellers of this fact (the cheeky Brummie assumption here being that London commuters always look at the floor). 

 But the British maglev never really took off. Tim Dunn, transport historian and co-presenter of the BBC's Trainspotting Live, explains why. ""The early 80s was still a time of great British national-funded engineering,"" he says. ""Success at Birmingham Airport would have been a great advert for British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) to sell maglev internationally. (Remember that BREL was always trying to sell its technology overseas, which is why several Pacer trains, developed on bus bodies, were sold to Iran.) Birmingham's Maglev only lasted 11 years: replacement parts were getting hard to obtain for what was really a unique system. Buses took over, and eventually a cable-hauled SkyRail people-mover was installed atop the piers. That's not as exciting for people like me, who like the idea of being whisked in a hovertrain pushed along by magnets. But then our real transport future always has been a pretty crap approximation of our dreams.""
You don't have to look far to find other relics of this white-hot time when post-war confidence begat all sorts of oddities. There's the test track for the French Aerotrain outside Orleans – a rocket-powered prototype that never made it to middle age. And in Emsland, the German conglomerate Transrapid built a 32km supersized test track for their maglev, which seemed to be on course for success. A variation of this train shuttles passengers from Shanghai to the airport, and the plan was to copy the same model in Munich, and even build an intercity line from Berlin to Hamburg. Today the test track stands idle awaiting its fate, while the Transrapid vehicles are up for auction; a museum in Erfurt is trying to save the latter from the scrapyard. Little remains of Germany's other maglev, the M-Bahn (or Magnetbahn), a short-lived shuttle service that ran in West Berlin from 1989-91 connecting stations whose service had been previously severed by the Berlin Wall. With the Wall gone, the old U-Bahn service was reinstated and the M-Bahn, which had run along its tracks, disappeared from the capital of the new Germany.

50,"Participative Pedagogy for a Literacy of Literacies
People act and learn together for a rich mixture of reasons. The current
 story that most of us tell ourselves about how humans get things done is
 focused on the well-known flavors of self-interest, which make for great
 drama−survival, power, wealth, sex, glory. People also do things
 together for fun, for the love of a challenge, and because we sometimes
 enjoy working together to make something beneficial to everybody. If I
 had to reduce the essence of Homo sapiens to five words, “people do
 complicated things together” would do. Online social networks can be
 powerful amplifiers of collective action precisely because they augment
 and extend the power of ever-complexifying human sociality. To be sure,
 gossip, conflict, slander, fraud, greed and bigotry are part of human
 sociality, and those parts of human behavior can be amplified, too. But
 altruism, fun, community and curiosity are also parts of human
 sociality−and I propose that the Web is an existence proof that these
 capabilities can be amplified, as well. Indeed, our species’ social
 inventiveness is central to what it is to be human. The parts of the
 human brain that evolved most recently, and which are connected to what
 we consider to be our “higher” faculties of reason and forethought, are
 also essential to social life. The neural information-processing
 required for recognizing people, remembering their reputations, learning
 the rituals that remove boundaries of mistrust and bind groups together,
 from bands to communities to civilizations, may have been enabled by
 (and may have driven the rapid evolution of) that uniquely human brain
 structure, the neocortex.
But I didn’t start out by thinking about the evolutionary dynamics of
 sociality and the amplification of collective action. Like all of the
 others in this book, I started out by experiencing the new ways of being
 that Internet social media have made possible. And like the other
 Freesouls, Joi Ito has played a catalytic, communitarian,
 Mephistophelian, Pied-Piper-esque, authority-challenging, fun-loving
 role in my experiences of the possibilities of life online.
Friends and Enthusiasts
To me, direct experience of what I later came to call virtual
 communities preceded theories about the ways people
 do things together online. I met Joi Ito in the 1980s as part of what we
 called “the Electronic Networking Association,” a small group of
 enthusiasts who thought that sending black and white text to BBSs with
 1200 baud modems was fun. Joi, like Stewart Brand, was and is what Fred
 Turner calls a network entrepreneur, who
 occupies what Ronald Burt would call key structural roles−what
 Malcolm Gladwell called a connector.  Joi was also a
 believer in going out and doing things and not just talking about it.
Joi was one of the founders of a multicultural BBS in Tokyo, and in the
 early 1990s I had begun to branch out from BBSs and the WELL to
 make connections in many different parts of the world. The fun of
 talking, planning, debating and helping each other online came before
 the notion that our tiny subculture might grow into a worldwide,
 many-to-many, multimedia network of a billion people.  We started to
 dream about future cybersocial possibilities only after personally
 experiencing something new, moving and authentic in our webs of budding
 friendship and collaboration. In recent years, cyberculture studies has
 grown into a discipline−more properly, an interdiscipline involving
 sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, economists,
 programmers and political scientists. Back when people online argued in
 1200 baud text about whether one could properly call what we were doing
 a form of community, there was no body of empirical evidence to serve as
 a foundation for scientific argument−all theory was anecdotal. By now,
 however, there is plenty of data.
One particularly useful affordance of online sociality is that a great
 deal of public behavior is recorded and structured in a way that makes
 it suitable for systematic study. One effect of the digital Panopticon
 is the loss of privacy and the threat of tyrannical social control;
 another effect is a rich body of data about online behavior. Every one
 of Wikipedia’s millions of edits, and all the discussion and talk pages
 associated with those edits, is available for inspection−along with
 billions of Usenet messages. Patterns are beginning to emerge. We’re
 beginning to know something about what works and what doesn’t work with
 people online, and why.
Does knowing something about the way technical architecture influences
 behavior mean that we can put that knowledge to use? Now that we are
 beginning to learn a little about the specific sociotechnical
 affordances of online social networks, is it possible to derive a
 normative design? How should designers think about the principles of
 beneficial social software? Can inhumane or dehumanizing effects of
 digital socializing be mitigated or eliminated by better media design?
 In what ways does the design of social media enable or prevent heartfelt
 communitas, organized collective action, social capital, cultural and
 economic production? I’ve continued to make a direct experience of my
 life online−from lifelong friends like Joi Ito to the other people
 around the world I’ve come to know, because online media made it
 possible to connect with people who shared my interests, even if I had
 never heard of them before, even if they lived on the other side of the
 world. But in parallel with my direct experience of the blogosphere,
 vlogosphere, twitterverse and other realms of digital discourse, I’ve
 continued to track new research and theory about what cyberculture might
 mean and the ways in which online communication media influence and are
 shaped by social forces.
The Values of Volunteers
One of the first questions that arose from my earliest experiences
 online was the question of why people in online communities should spend
 so much time answering each other’s questions, solving each other’s
 problems, without financial compensation. I first encountered Yochai
 Benkler in pursuit of my curiosity about the reason people would work
 together with strangers, without pay, to create something nobody
 owns−free and open source software. First in Coase’s Penguin, and
 then in The Wealth of Networks, Benkler contributed to important
 theoretical foundations for a new way of thinking about online
 activity−”commons based peer production,” technically made possible by a
 billion PCs and Internet connections−as a new form of organizing
 economic production, together with the market and the firm. If Benkler
 is right, the new story about how humans get things done includes an
 important corollary−if tools like the PC and the Internet make it easy
 enough, people are willing to work together for non-market incentives to
 create software, encyclopedias and archives of public domain literature.
 While the old story is that people are highly unlikely to
 cooperate with strangers to voluntarily create public goods, the new
 story seems to be that people will indeed create significant common
 value voluntarily, if it is easy enough for anybody to add what they
 want, whenever they want to add it (“self election”). There is plenty of
 evidence to support the hypothesis that what used to be considered
 altruism is now a byproduct of daily life online. So much of what we
 take for granted as part of daily life online, from the BIND software
 that makes domain names work, to the Apache webserver that powers a
 sizable chunk of the world’s websites, to the cheap Linux servers that
 Google stacks into its global datacloud, was created by volunteers who
 gave their creations away to make possible something larger−the Web as
 we know it.
To some degree, the explosion of creativity that followed the debut of
 the Web in 1993 was made possible by deliberate design decisions on the
 part of the Internet’s architects−the end-to-end principle, built into
 the TCP/IP protocols that make the Internet possible, which deliberately
 decentralizes the power to innovate, to build something new and even
 more powerful on what already exists. Is it possible to understand
 exactly what it is about the web that makes Wikipedia, Linux,
 FightAIDS@Home, the Gutenberg Project and Creative Commons possible? And
 if so, can this theoretical knowledge be put to practical use? I am
 struck by a phrase of Benkler’s from his essay in this book: “We must
 now turn our attention to building systems that support human
 sociality.” That sounds right. But how would it be done? It’s easy to
 say and not as easy to see the ways in which social codes and power
 structures mold the design of communication media. We must develop a
 participative pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics,
 that focuses on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and
 guiding literacies essential to individual and collective life.
A Participative Pedagogy
To accomplish this attention-turning, we must develop a participative
 pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics, that focuses
 on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and guiding
 literacies essential to individual and collective life in the 21st
 century. Literacies are where the human brain, human sociality and
 communication technologies meet. We’re accustomed to thinking about the
 tangible parts of communication media−the devices and networks−but the
 less visible social practices and social affordances, from the alphabet
 to TCP/IP, are where human social genius can meet the augmenting power
 of technological networks. Literacy is the most important method Homo
 sapiens has used to introduce systems and tools to other humans, to
 train each other to partake of and contribute to culture, and to
 humanize the use of instruments that might otherwise enable
 commodification, mechanization and dehumanization. By literacy, I mean,
 following on Neil Postman and others, the set of skills that enable
 individuals to encode and decode knowledge and power via speech,
 writing, printing and collective action, and which, when learned,
 introduce the individual to a community. Literacy links technology and
 sociality. The alphabet did not cause the Roman Empire, but made it
 possible. Printing did not cause democracy or science, but literate
 populations, enabled by the printing press, devised systems for citizen
 governance and collective knowledge creation. The Internet did not cause
 open source production, Wikipedia or emergent collective responses to
 natural disasters, but it made it possible for people to act together in
 new ways, with people they weren’t able to organize action with before,
 in places and at paces for which collective action had never been
 possible. Literacies are the prerequisite for the human agency that used
 alphabets, presses and digital networks to create wealth, alleviate
 suffering and invent new institutions. If the humans currently alive are
 to take advantage of digital technologies to address the most severe
 problems that face our species and the biosphere, computers, telephones
 and digital networks are not enough. We need new literacies around
 participatory media, the dynamics of cooperation and collective action,
 the effective deployment of attention and the relatively rational and
 critical discourse necessary for a healthy public sphere.
Media Literacies
In Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic
 Engagement, I wrote:
If print culture shaped the environment in which the Enlightenment
 blossomed and set the scene for the Industrial Revolution,
 participatory media might similarly shape the cognitive and social
 environments in which twenty first century life will take place (a
 shift in the way our culture operates). For this reason, participatory
 media literacy is not another subject to be shoehorned into the
 curriculum as job training for knowledge workers.
Participatory media include (but aren’t limited to) blogs, wikis, RSS,
 tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups,
 podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network
 services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. These distinctly
 different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:
Many-to-many media now make it possible for every person connected
 to the network to broadcast as well as receive text, images,
 audio, video, software, data, discussions, transactions,
 computations, tags, or links to and from every other person. The
 asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by
 the structure of pre-digital technologies has changed radically.
 This is a technical- structural characteristic.
Participatory media are social media whose value and power derives
 from the active participation of many people. Value derives not
 just from the size of the audience, but from their power to link
 to each other, to form a public as well as a market. This is a
 psychological and social characteristic.
Social networks, when amplified by information and communication
 networks, enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination
 of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.
Like the early days of print, radio, and television, the present
 structure of the participatory media regime−the political, economic,
 social and cultural institutions that constrain and empower the way
 the new medium can be used, and which impose structures on flows of
 information and capital−is still unsettled. As legislative and
 regulatory battles, business competition, and social institutions vie
 to control the new regime, a potentially decisive and presently
 unknown variable is the degree and kind of public participation.
 Because the unique power of the new media regime is precisely its
 participatory potential, the number of people who participate in using
 it during its formative years, and the skill with which they attempt
 to take advantage of this potential, is particularly salient.
Like Yochai Benkler and Henry Jenkins, I believe that a
 participatory culture in which most of the population see themselves as
 creators as well as consumers of culture is far more likely to generate
 freedom and wealth for more people than one in which a small portion of
 the population produces culture that the majority passively consume. The
 technological infrastructure for participatory media has grown rapidly,
 piggybacking on Moore’s Law, globalization, the telecom bubble and the
 innovations of Swiss physicists and computer science
 students. Increasingly, access to that infrastructure−the ability to
 upload a Macaca video or uncover a threat to democracy−has become
 economically accessible. Literacy−access to the codes and communities of
 vernacular video, microblogging, social bookmarking, wiki
 collaboration−is what is required to use that infrastructure to create a
 participatory culture. A population with broadband infrastructure and
 ubiquitous computing could be a captive audience for a cultural
 monopoly, given enough bad laws and judicial rulings. A population that
 knows what to do with the tools at hand stands a better chance of
 resisting enclosure. The more people who know how to use participatory
 media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate and
 organize, the more likely the future infosphere will allow, enable and
 encourage liberty and participation. Such literacy can only make action
 possible, however−it is not in the technology, or even in the knowledge
 of how to use it, but in the ways people use knowledge and technology to
 create wealth, secure freedom, resist tyranny.

 drama−survival, power, wealth, sex, glory. People also do things
 together for fun, for the love of a challenge, and because we sometimes
 enjoy working together to make something beneficial to everybody. If I
 had to reduce the essence of Homo sapiens to five words, “people do
 complicated things together” would do. Online social networks can be
 powerful amplifiers of collective action precisely because they augment
 and extend the power of ever-complexifying human sociality. To be sure,
 gossip, conflict, slander, fraud, greed and bigotry are part of human
 sociality, and those parts of human behavior can be amplified, too. But
 altruism, fun, community and curiosity are also parts of human
 sociality−and I propose that the Web is an existence proof that these
 capabilities can be amplified, as well. Indeed, our species’ social
 inventiveness is central to what it is to be human. The parts of the
 human brain that evolved most recently, and which are connected to what
 we consider to be our “higher” faculties of reason and forethought, are
 also essential to social life. The neural information-processing
 required for recognizing people, remembering their reputations, learning
 the rituals that remove boundaries of mistrust and bind groups together,
 from bands to communities to civilizations, may have been enabled by
 (and may have driven the rapid evolution of) that uniquely human brain
 structure, the neocortex.
But I didn’t start out by thinking about the evolutionary dynamics of
 sociality and the amplification of collective action. Like all of the
 others in this book, I started out by experiencing the new ways of being
 that Internet social media have made possible. And like the other
 Freesouls, Joi Ito has played a catalytic, communitarian,
 Mephistophelian, Pied-Piper-esque, authority-challenging, fun-loving
 role in my experiences of the possibilities of life online.
Friends and Enthusiasts
To me, direct experience of what I later came to call virtual
 communities preceded theories about the ways people
 do things together online. I met Joi Ito in the 1980s as part of what we
 called “the Electronic Networking Association,” a small group of
 enthusiasts who thought that sending black and white text to BBSs with
 1200 baud modems was fun. Joi, like Stewart Brand, was and is what Fred
 Turner calls a network entrepreneur, who
 occupies what Ronald Burt would call key structural roles−what
 Malcolm Gladwell called a connector.  Joi was also a
 believer in going out and doing things and not just talking about it.
Joi was one of the founders of a multicultural BBS in Tokyo, and in the
 early 1990s I had begun to branch out from BBSs and the WELL to
 make connections in many different parts of the world. The fun of
 talking, planning, debating and helping each other online came before
 the notion that our tiny subculture might grow into a worldwide,
 many-to-many, multimedia network of a billion people.  We started to
 dream about future cybersocial possibilities only after personally
 experiencing something new, moving and authentic in our webs of budding
 friendship and collaboration. In recent years, cyberculture studies has
 grown into a discipline−more properly, an interdiscipline involving
 sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, economists,
 programmers and political scientists. Back when people online argued in
 1200 baud text about whether one could properly call what we were doing
 a form of community, there was no body of empirical evidence to serve as
 a foundation for scientific argument−all theory was anecdotal. By now,
 however, there is plenty of data.
One particularly useful affordance of online sociality is that a great
 deal of public behavior is recorded and structured in a way that makes
 it suitable for systematic study. One effect of the digital Panopticon
 is the loss of privacy and the threat of tyrannical social control;
 another effect is a rich body of data about online behavior. Every one
 of Wikipedia’s millions of edits, and all the discussion and talk pages
 associated with those edits, is available for inspection−along with
 billions of Usenet messages. Patterns are beginning to emerge. We’re
 beginning to know something about what works and what doesn’t work with
 people online, and why.
Does knowing something about the way technical architecture influences
 behavior mean that we can put that knowledge to use? Now that we are
 beginning to learn a little about the specific sociotechnical
 affordances of online social networks, is it possible to derive a
 normative design? How should designers think about the principles of
 beneficial social software? Can inhumane or dehumanizing effects of
 digital socializing be mitigated or eliminated by better media design?
 In what ways does the design of social media enable or prevent heartfelt
 communitas, organized collective action, social capital, cultural and
 economic production? I’ve continued to make a direct experience of my
 life online−from lifelong friends like Joi Ito to the other people
 around the world I’ve come to know, because online media made it
 possible to connect with people who shared my interests, even if I had
 never heard of them before, even if they lived on the other side of the
 world. But in parallel with my direct experience of the blogosphere,
 vlogosphere, twitterverse and other realms of digital discourse, I’ve
 continued to track new research and theory about what cyberculture might
 mean and the ways in which online communication media influence and are
 shaped by social forces.
The Values of Volunteers
One of the first questions that arose from my earliest experiences
 online was the question of why people in online communities should spend
 so much time answering each other’s questions, solving each other’s
 problems, without financial compensation. I first encountered Yochai
 Benkler in pursuit of my curiosity about the reason people would work
 together with strangers, without pay, to create something nobody
 owns−free and open source software. First in Coase’s Penguin, and
 then in The Wealth of Networks, Benkler contributed to important
 theoretical foundations for a new way of thinking about online
 activity−”commons based peer production,” technically made possible by a
 billion PCs and Internet connections−as a new form of organizing
 economic production, together with the market and the firm. If Benkler
 is right, the new story about how humans get things done includes an
 important corollary−if tools like the PC and the Internet make it easy
 enough, people are willing to work together for non-market incentives to
 create software, encyclopedias and archives of public domain literature.
 While the old story is that people are highly unlikely to
 cooperate with strangers to voluntarily create public goods, the new
 story seems to be that people will indeed create significant common
 value voluntarily, if it is easy enough for anybody to add what they
 want, whenever they want to add it (“self election”). There is plenty of
 evidence to support the hypothesis that what used to be considered
 altruism is now a byproduct of daily life online. So much of what we
 take for granted as part of daily life online, from the BIND software
 that makes domain names work, to the Apache webserver that powers a
 sizable chunk of the world’s websites, to the cheap Linux servers that
 Google stacks into its global datacloud, was created by volunteers who
 gave their creations away to make possible something larger−the Web as
 we know it.
To some degree, the explosion of creativity that followed the debut of
 the Web in 1993 was made possible by deliberate design decisions on the
 part of the Internet’s architects−the end-to-end principle, built into
 the TCP/IP protocols that make the Internet possible, which deliberately
 decentralizes the power to innovate, to build something new and even
 more powerful on what already exists. Is it possible to understand
 exactly what it is about the web that makes Wikipedia, Linux,
 FightAIDS@Home, the Gutenberg Project and Creative Commons possible? And
 if so, can this theoretical knowledge be put to practical use? I am
 struck by a phrase of Benkler’s from his essay in this book: “We must
 now turn our attention to building systems that support human
 sociality.” That sounds right. But how would it be done? It’s easy to
 say and not as easy to see the ways in which social codes and power
 structures mold the design of communication media. We must develop a
 participative pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics,
 that focuses on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and
 guiding literacies essential to individual and collective life.
A Participative Pedagogy
To accomplish this attention-turning, we must develop a participative
 pedagogy, assisted by digital media and networked publics, that focuses
 on catalyzing, inspiring, nourishing, facilitating, and guiding
 literacies essential to individual and collective life in the 21st
 century. Literacies are where the human brain, human sociality and
 communication technologies meet. We’re accustomed to thinking about the
 tangible parts of communication media−the devices and networks−but the
 less visible social practices and social affordances, from the alphabet
 to TCP/IP, are where human social genius can meet the augmenting power
 of technological networks. Literacy is the most important method Homo
 sapiens has used to introduce systems and tools to other humans, to
 train each other to partake of and contribute to culture, and to
 humanize the use of instruments that might otherwise enable
 commodification, mechanization and dehumanization. By literacy, I mean,
 following on Neil Postman and others, the set of skills that enable
 individuals to encode and decode knowledge and power via speech,
 writing, printing and collective action, and which, when learned,
 introduce the individual to a community. Literacy links technology and
 sociality. The alphabet did not cause the Roman Empire, but made it
 possible. Printing did not cause democracy or science, but literate
 populations, enabled by the printing press, devised systems for citizen
 governance and collective knowledge creation. The Internet did not cause
 open source production, Wikipedia or emergent collective responses to
 natural disasters, but it made it possible for people to act together in
 new ways, with people they weren’t able to organize action with before,
 in places and at paces for which collective action had never been
 possible. Literacies are the prerequisite for the human agency that used
 alphabets, presses and digital networks to create wealth, alleviate
 suffering and invent new institutions. If the humans currently alive are
 to take advantage of digital technologies to address the most severe
 problems that face our species and the biosphere, computers, telephones
 and digital networks are not enough. We need new literacies around
 participatory media, the dynamics of cooperation and collective action,
 the effective deployment of attention and the relatively rational and
 critical discourse necessary for a healthy public sphere.
Media Literacies
In Using Participatory Media and Public Voice to Encourage Civic
 Engagement, I wrote:
If print culture shaped the environment in which the Enlightenment
 blossomed and set the scene for the Industrial Revolution,
 participatory media might similarly shape the cognitive and social
 environments in which twenty first century life will take place (a
 shift in the way our culture operates). For this reason, participatory
 media literacy is not another subject to be shoehorned into the
 curriculum as job training for knowledge workers.
Participatory media include (but aren’t limited to) blogs, wikis, RSS,
 tagging and social bookmarking, music-photo-video sharing, mashups,
 podcasts, digital storytelling, virtual communities, social network
 services, virtual environments, and videoblogs. These distinctly
 different media share three common, interrelated characteristics:
Many-to-many media now make it possible for every person connected
 to the network to broadcast as well as receive text, images,
 audio, video, software, data, discussions, transactions,
 computations, tags, or links to and from every other person. The
 asymmetry between broadcaster and audience that was dictated by
 the structure of pre-digital technologies has changed radically.
 This is a technical- structural characteristic.
Participatory media are social media whose value and power derives
 from the active participation of many people. Value derives not
 just from the size of the audience, but from their power to link
 to each other, to form a public as well as a market. This is a
 psychological and social characteristic.
Social networks, when amplified by information and communication
 networks, enable broader, faster, and lower cost coordination
 of activities. This is an economic and political characteristic.
Like the early days of print, radio, and television, the present
 structure of the participatory media regime−the political, economic,
 social and cultural institutions that constrain and empower the way
 the new medium can be used, and which impose structures on flows of
 information and capital−is still unsettled. As legislative and
 regulatory battles, business competition, and social institutions vie
 to control the new regime, a potentially decisive and presently
 unknown variable is the degree and kind of public participation.
 Because the unique power of the new media regime is precisely its
 participatory potential, the number of people who participate in using
 it during its formative years, and the skill with which they attempt
 to take advantage of this potential, is particularly salient.
Like Yochai Benkler and Henry Jenkins, I believe that a
 participatory culture in which most of the population see themselves as
 creators as well as consumers of culture is far more likely to generate
 freedom and wealth for more people than one in which a small portion of
 the population produces culture that the majority passively consume. The
 technological infrastructure for participatory media has grown rapidly,
 piggybacking on Moore’s Law, globalization, the telecom bubble and the
 innovations of Swiss physicists and computer science
 students. Increasingly, access to that infrastructure−the ability to
 upload a Macaca video or uncover a threat to democracy−has become
 economically accessible. Literacy−access to the codes and communities of
 vernacular video, microblogging, social bookmarking, wiki
 collaboration−is what is required to use that infrastructure to create a
 participatory culture. A population with broadband infrastructure and
 ubiquitous computing could be a captive audience for a cultural
 monopoly, given enough bad laws and judicial rulings. A population that
 knows what to do with the tools at hand stands a better chance of
 resisting enclosure. The more people who know how to use participatory
 media to learn, inform, persuade, investigate, reveal, advocate and
 organize, the more likely the future infosphere will allow, enable and
 encourage liberty and participation. Such literacy can only make action
 possible, however−it is not in the technology, or even in the knowledge
 of how to use it, but in the ways people use knowledge and technology to
 create wealth, secure freedom, resist tyranny.

Even if your interest in global politics extends no further than an occasional worried glance at the headlines, it will not have escaped your notice that there's something in the air these past few years: a kind of comprehensive, worldwide souring of the possibilities of representative democracy. 

 You might not have thought of it in just these terms, but you'll certainly recognise its effects: it has shown up in phenomena as varied and seemingly disconnected as the Brexit referendum, the candidacy of Donald Trump in the USA and the turn toward authoritarian parties and governments in France, Turkey, Hungary, the Philippines and elsewhere. This is, perhaps, the pre-eminent political story of our time. 

 What all of these more recent developments have in common is the sense among a wide swath of the electorate, in country after country, that the conventional practice of democracy has failed them. It no longer expresses the will of the people, if it ever did, and now serves only the needs of distant, shadowy, unspecified elites. And as is so often the case, there is a grain of truth to this. 

 Our democracies certainly do seem to be having a hard time reckoning with many profound crises, whether these involve the integration of refugees, the disappearance of work or the threats of climate change. Our existing ways of making collective decisions have conspicuously failed to help us develop policies equal to the scale of crisis. There really is a global 1 per cent, and they seem to be hell-bent on having themselves a new Gilded Age, even as the public services the rest of us depend on are stripped to the bone. Throw in the despair that sets in after many years of imposed austerity and it's no wonder that many people have had enough. 

 Some voters, either impervious to the lessons of history, or certain that whatever comes, they'll wind up on top, seek the clarity and vigour of a strong hand. They are perhaps encouraged by authoritarian leaders abroad, with their own internal reasons for disparaging the practice of democracy and much to gain by undermining confidence in it. Other voters have no particular time for the right, but feel betrayed by the parties they once trusted to advance their class interest. When they look around and see that someone other than them is indeed profiting from the status quo, they lose all patience with the idea that redress can be found in the ballot box. They're willing to see their own house burned down, if that's what it takes to stick it to the despised elites that are suddenly, heedlessly gentrifying their neighbourhoods and 'decanting' them from their homes. 

 These are certainly depressing responses to the situation we find ourselves in, but they're not in any way irrational. Yet there's another, more hopeful and interesting way of responding to this same set of facts. It argues that what we need now is more democracy, not less; and a new kind of democracy at that, one founded on technical means. This curious prospect is presented to us by modes of social organisation and self-governance based on the blockchain, the technology underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. And though blockchain advocates are nowhere near as prominent as the neo-authoritarian tendencies everywhere around us, what they are arguing for – 'distributed consensus' – is so interesting and so utterly unlike anything that has gone before that it deserves our fullest and most serious consideration.
We're told that this emerging technology of 'distributed consensus' makes entirely new forms of human association possible; that anyone who wants to will be able to organise themselves into non-hierarchical groups with as much ability to act in the world as any state or corporation.  

 The idea is that governmental structures at just about every level of society would be replaced by voluntary associations represented as software. Participants in these groups could remain anonymous to one another, if desired. But their identities would be verified – and their votes authenticated – by the same processes that secure the Bitcoin network, meaning that a permanent, secure record of every vote ever taken would be available for all to see. As each of these groups would be able to dispose of fiscal resources directly, Porto Alegre-style participatory budgeting could be realised, at whatever scale required. And just like Bitcoin, all of this functionality would be distributed across the network, making it inherently resistant to attempts at state censorship or control.
Enthusiasm for distributed consensus is especially marked on the left, and it's easy to understand why: you'd have a hard time intentionally designing language more likely to appeal to tech-savvy horizontalists than 'distributed consensus'. The phrase summons up images of a society organised as a supple network instead of a hierarchy, its far-flung and mobile constituents bound together by a guiding ethos of participation, and an immaterial but powerful calculated technology.
Thoughtful veterans of the post-2008 moment could be forgiven for thinking that, just maybe, here at last is a concrete way of achieving ends promised but never quite delivered by 15M, Occupy, Nuit Débout, or what has come to be known as the broader global 'movement of the squares': a commons outside the market and the state, a framework for democratic decision-making truly suited to the context of 21st-century life, and just possibly a functioning anarchy. 

 This is certainly a supremely attractive vision, at least for those of us whose hearts beat a little bit faster at the prospect of ordinary people everywhere taking their fate into their own hands. In fact, there's really only one problem with it: it's all based on a misunderstanding.
Let's back up a little. What, exactly, does distributed consensus mean? And what does it have to do with the new forms of democracy that might now be available to us? 

 At a time when 'disruption' and 'disintermediation' remain potent words in the tech community, it was inevitable that someone would think to disrupt the way we organise civic life. Early experiments in digital democracy mostly confined themselves to tinkering in the mechanics of an otherwise conventional political process – working out, for example, how verified electronic voting might work. But more recent proposals, such as the ""distributed autonomous organisations"" pioneered by the Ethereum project, and the structurally similar Backfeed and democracy.earth initiatives, offer far more ambitious ideas of networked citizenship and decision-making. 

 All three are based on the decentralised system of authentication that was originally developed for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The details of this mechanism are fiendishly difficult to understand, but its essence – and the innovation that so excites fans of networked democracy – is that it proves the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions computationally, instead of relying on the authority of any government or banking institution. 

 Everything rests on the blockchain, a permanent, transparent record of every exchange of Bitcoin ever made, an identical copy of which is held locally by every machine participating in the network. The blockchain maintains and reconciles all account balances, and is the sole arbiter in the event of a discrepancy or dispute. Whenever a new transaction appears on the Bitcoin network, all of its nodes perform an elaborate series of calculations aimed at validating it, and a majority of them must agree its legitimacy before it can be added to the shared record. This peer-to-peer process of distributed consensus can be applied beyond cryptocurrency to other situations that require some kind of procedure for the collective construction of truth.
One of these is communal decision-making, at every level from household to nation. So by extension distributed consensus could be applied to the practice of democracy. Moreover, frameworks based on the blockchain promise to solve a number of long-standing democratic problems. 

 They give organisers the ability to form associations rapidly and equip them with clear, secure and answerable decision processes. Their provisions allow members of those associations to float proposals, raise points for discussion among their peers, and allow enough time for deliberation before a question is called to a vote. They seem well suited to address some of the limits and frustrations of the Occupy-style forum, chiefly its requirement that everyone sharing an interest be present at once in order to be counted. And by allowing an association to specify any decision rule it pleases – from simple majority to absolute consensus – these frameworks even seem as if they might address the distaste some of us have always harboured for the coercion implicit in any majoritarian process (many don't like the idea that they need to go along with a notion just because 52 per cent of the population voted for it). 

 These systems would appear to be applicable to democracy, then. But more than that, they gesture beyond conventional politics, toward something not far off utopian. 

 When I meet people who are genuinely excited by platforms like democracy.earth, Ethereum and Backfeed, most often what they're responding to is not so much about how these frameworks address the practicalities of small-group decision-making. They're more about the radical, classically anarchist vision they offer of a world in which power is distributed across a federation of nonhierarchical assemblies unsanctioned by any apparatus of state, each one lasting just long enough to enact its participants' will before evaporating for ever. 

 And that's why it's little short of heartbreaking to conclude that their hopes stem from a confusion of language. 

 There's a fair degree of slippage between the way we'd be likely to interpret 'distributed consensus' in a political context, and what the same phrase actually denotes in its proper, technical context. As it turns out, here the word 'consensus' doesn't have anything to do with that sense of common purpose nurtured among a group of people over the course of long and difficult negotiations. Rather, it is technical jargon: it simply refers to the process by which all of the computers participating in the Bitcoin network eventually come to agree that a given transaction is valid. Instead of being a technically mediated process of agreement among peers and equals separated from one another in space and time, it's actually just a reconciliation of calculations being performed by distant machines.  

 To mistake the one for the other is to commit a dangerous error.
Why dangerous? One of the primary risks we face in embracing blockchain-based structures is that we may not actually be advancing the set of values we think we are. The provisions that frameworks like Ethereum, Backfeed and democracy.earth are founded on, in particular, are difficult to reconcile with other values and commitments we may hold, especially the notion of a life in common.  

 An Ethereum distributed autonomous organisation, for example, requires that members buy shares in it in order to participate. This is necessitated by the reward structure that incentivises machines to perform the calculations that establish distributed consensus; but it seems curiously at odds with our understanding of political participation as an inalienable right. Ethereum democracies, too, have something most others do not: owners, someone empowered to add or remove voting members at will, set its binding decision rules, and change those rules whenever they desire. 

 This is certainly a novel and interesting definition of a democracy. In fact, we find, on looking just a little more closely, that relations of property and ownership are absolutely central to this set of technologies – perhaps unsurprisingly, given its origins in the libertarian cryptocurrency community. This, for example, is how Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin thinks of human association: 

 ""In general, a human organisation can be defined as combination of two things: a set of property, and a protocol for a set of individuals, which may or may not be divided into certain classes with different conditions for entering or leaving the set, to interact with each other including rules for under what circumstances the individuals may use certain parts of the property."" 

 On closer inspection, this doesn't seem to have much to do with the practice of collective self-determination. And with a similar emphasis on property rights, the discourse around the blockchain also routinely treats as uncontroversial statements which are no such thing. The acceptance of these values runs so deep that when democracy.earth announced itself ""a Y Combinator-backed organisation"", nobody involved evidently wondered whether something which aspired to be a radical new way of doing politics should tout its backing by a venture-capital seed fund based in Silicon Valley. 

 However utopian a politics of distributed consensus might sound to us, then, there's no way in which it can be prised apart from the entirely conventional constructions of ownership, private property and capital accumulation at its very heart, at least not in its present form. The profoundly murky quality of blockchain technology – and the relative lack of accessible but technically sophisticated resources that might explain it – thus causes some of us to endorse a set of propositions we'd otherwise recoil from. We criticise lack of government transparency, yet the blockchain is unfathomable to most people. 

 Finally, too many of those touting distributed democracy retain a weirdly naive faith in the promises made about the blockchain's ability to transcend human fallibility, despite the well-known history of Bitcoin hacks, thefts and exploits. The founders of democracy.earth, for example, would have us believe that the blockchain is 'incorruptible', when, as all long-time observers of the cryptocurrency scene know, it's anything but. There is no better case in point than Ethereum's own networked democracy, a distributed venture fund rather confusingly called the DAO – Decentralised Autonomous Organisation – which was notoriously drained of a full third of its value by someone who evidently understood its coding better than its own originators. The Ethereum blockchain was subsequently 'hard forked' to undo this exploit, but only at the cost of angering that passionate fraction of their community convinced that distributed calculation could achieve what millennia of human law and custom had not. 

 Though they may someday be robust enough to undergird decisions of genuine import, the experience of the DAO suggests that blockchain-based protocols are at present no more trustworthy than any of the less glamorous methods for assessing communal sentiment we already have at our disposal: the assembly, the discussion and the poll.
There's a long list of benefits that might follow from shifting civic life on to a networked platform. 

 If people could participate in public life from their laptop (or smartphone, or gaming platform), we might be able to democratise democracy itself, in all sorts of salutary ways. We might fold in all those who, by dint of their work, childcare or family obligations, are too exhausted or pressed for time to attend a decision-making assembly, and prevent the common circumstance in which such an assembly is captured by a bad-faith participant with an axe to grind. We could avoid having to gather stakeholders in a given place and time to make decisions of common import, and allow people to participate in public life as and when they were able to. And we could apply to that participation all the tools that arise from being networked and digital, particularly the ability to capture and analyse detailed data about a matter up for discussion.  

 Under such circumstances, decisions could be compared between polities and jurisdictions, or with ones made locally in the past, and every aspect of a community's process of self-determination could be searchable, so available to all who might benefit. Over time, we might even learn to make wiser decisions, individually and collectively. Though the devil is always in the detail of implementation, these possibilities are all well worth exploring; and taken together they certainly furnish us with a strong case for networked democracy. 

 But there are problems even with such relatively simple articulations of civic technology. Not everyone owns a smartphone, even now, let alone any more expensive networked devices. Just over 60 per cent of North Americans do, which falls far short of the universal access on which any system for networked democracy would need to be based. And technologists and advocates for new technology are often blind to the digital divide, which prevents measures that seem utterly obvious and self-evident to them from being at all suited to the lives of others. 

 Transplanting democracy on to the blockchain is more problematic still, especially for those of us who aspire to a life broadly governed by the principles of the commons. When we dig beneath appealing-sounding buzzwords like 'peer-to-peer' and 'open source', we find that all of the current, real-world examples of blockchain technology commit us to a set of values that isn't merely at variance with those principles, but is outright inimical to them. (Our ignorance about how the blockchain actually works is an additional source of concern. When something is this complicated, this difficult for even very bright people to understand, it's inherently open to the greatest potential for abuse. The market in derivative securities comes to mind.) 

 But maybe these are errors we can learn from. It's worth asking if some of the things the blockchain-based frameworks promise to do for us might be lifted whole out of the matrix of their origins.  

 They get a lot of things very right, after all – particularly their understanding that democracy is an ongoing process, and not something that happens in a voting booth on one day every four or five years. And by framing the practice of active citizenship as something appropriate to every scale of collective existence, they suggest that such participation should occupy a larger place in our civic lives; that we can and should assume control over a wider range of the circumstances of our being. 

 By the same token, democratic practice is a subtle thing. It is possible to do a great deal of damage by applying it without due regard for its strengths and limitations – witness Brexit. So perhaps the most important thing we might seek to gain from our encounter with tools like Backfeed and democracy.earth is a lesson in what works at what scale and what doesn't. We could then design a generation of distributed collective decision processes that are straightforward enough to be understood by the people using them, and not beholden to profoundly interested notions of private advantage. Developing an infrastructure built from the ground up would be a great way of redeeming the hope that's already been invested in these systems, and it might even convince those who have become disillusioned with democracy that there's more life in the concept yet. Maybe it's time we got started.

In the last weekend of November, Sophie Walker took to the stage at the Women's Equality Party's first conference to make her leader's speech and, within a few minutes, began weeping. She cried as she recounted the difficulties of being a single parent trying to access services for her autistic daughter: ""Finding out that no one was interested, no one cared, no one welcomed her as person who lived differently."" 

 This wasn't just a stray tear, brushed away. Walker (pictured above) seemed to be struggling to go on. The conference held its breath. I gripped the sides of my chair in a mixture of sympathy and embarrassment, thinking this wasn't going to go down well in the media, that she would be mocked for feebleness; what kind of leader, faced with an audience of hundreds, stands in front of them and cries at life's defeats? 

 It was only afterwards that it occurred to me that this had been one of the most significant, and, yes, persuasive moments of the entire event. Walker could hardly have made her point – that her daughter's diagnosis had punctured her own privilege as a white, university-educated journalist (and tall and beautiful, which she did not say but which is nevertheless probably relevant) – more tellingly. Her tears powerfully conveyed her devastation at feeling her child was destined, as she put it, either to be invisible or to be exposed, and the helplessness this induced.
The Women's Equality party conference was awash with talk about women 'doing politics differently'. The phrase was trotted out repeatedly, although it wasn't entirely clear what it actually meant. This week, as hundreds of thousands of women prepare to march on Washington on Saturday following the inauguration of Donald Trump (with marches in 200 other US cities and more than 50 others worldwide, including across the UK and in London, where Sophie Walker will be one of the speakers) this seems a good moment to try to pin down whether there is anything new about 21st-century women's activism and, if so, what it is. 

 There are two ways in which women might potentially 'do politics differently': policy, and practice. As far as the former is concerned, the Women's Equality party is promoting broad areas of policy capable of attracting women from across the traditional political spectrum, including closing the gender pay gap, subsidising childcare, ending violence against women, and equal representation in business, politics and the media. Detail and delivery would be more fraught, but, for now, these are things most women can get behind. Both Nicky Morgan, former Conservative Education Secretary, and Sal Brinton, President of the Liberal Democrats, spoke at the conference. 

 It is in its practice, though, that women's activism has real potential to enlarge our understanding of what it means to be political. 

 Among the variety of reasons for Brexit and Trump, rage was right up there. Emotion is back in fashion. The Brexiters and Trump eschewed rational arguments in favour of pleas to feeling. Trump is President of Emotions. (Sad!) Yet we are ill-equipped to understand this outbreak of feeling, as Pankaj Mishra argues in his forthcoming book, The Age of Anger, because our dominant intellectual concepts are incapable of comprehending the role of emotion in politics. 

 Since the Enlightenment, Mishra argues, our political thinking has been ever more tightly gripped by materialist, mechanistic premises – for example by the idea that ""humans are essentially rational and motivated by the pursuit of their own interests; that they principally act to maximise personal happiness, rather than on the basis of fear, anger and resentment.""
Homo economicus
, he says, ""views the market as the ideal form of human interaction and venerates technological progress and the growth of GDP. All of this is part of the rigid contemporary belief that what counts is only what can be counted and that what cannot be counted – subjective emotions – therefore does not."" There is no room in this world view for more complex motivations: vanity, say, or the fear of humiliation.
How, then, to comprehend, let alone articulate, the vulnerability, the shame, the loss of identity created by inequality, job losses and purposeless communities? The roiling emotions engendered by capitalism's failure to confer the promised general prosperity cannot be understood when emotion is a thing men are meant to contain, then repudiate. Strongmen leaders do not stand in front of their political parties and weep about their daughters. That sort of thing is for losers. Male valour is about not showing emotional distress. (This is very deeply embedded in our culture: ""Thy tears are womanish,"" Shakespeare's Friar Lawrence scolds Romeo, although Romeo has every right to be upset, because he has just killed a man, who was Juliet's cousin.)
Emotion is stigmatised as belonging to lesser, non-normative groups. Women are hysterical. Black men are hypersexual. Homosexuals are unreliably camp. There is no option for the would-be winners, competing to maximise their self-interest, to respond to injury by saying,  ""Please, that's painful!"" – still less by weeping. 

 The emotion is there, nevertheless, metastasising. Since men without the means to express vulnerability cannot mourn frankly their loss of identity as a provider (let alone their disorientation when other groups threaten to undermine their unearned sense of superiority), injured masculinity must disguise itself in images of strength, mastery, honour. Trump himself is a personification of this phenomenon, as Laurie Penny has observed: ""At once an emblem of violent, impenetrable masculinity – the nasally-rigid, iron-hearted business Svengali determined to slap America until it stops snivelling – and a byword for hysterical sensitivity, a wailing man-baby with a hair-trigger temper.""
All this emotion-with-nowhere-to-go was seized on by the Trump and Brexit campaigns. They found a way to channel it, allowing electorates to associate themselves with winning, to bray 'losers' at people they didn't like. It turned out not to matter very much what they were winning at or where it took them. Getting Trump into the White House, like Brexit, was an end in itself, a way of displacing pain, therapeutic. 

 It was also deeply reactionary. The hideous inequalities of global capitalism being what they are, it is hard for the 99 per cent to conceive of themselves becoming winners as things stand – so Trump and Brexit offered instead a return to fantasies of the past. The iconography of Brexit has its roots in Britain's resistance to the Nazis (conveniently overlooking small things like imperial reach and American intervention), while the Trump campaign's ""make America great again"" offered still more explicit nostalgia for a time when the nation had a common destiny, with white men front and centre. 

 What women's activism might bring to politics is a different sensibility, one that acknowledges that emotions are inevitable, messy – and necessary. There is a hole in politics where opposition used to be and social democracy used to flourish. That is largely because rational arguments, facts, expertise, seem to bear too little relation to the way that many people feel about the world. The liberals' arguments seem to be conducted in a kind of parallel universe, of interest only to those who thrive there. When called to articulate a vision for Britain in Europe, the best Remainers could manage was an abstract account of financial penalties if the electorate didn't do as it was told – which, since it never connected, was easily dismissed as 'Project Fear'. 

 People have not, in fact, lost interest in truth. But first and foremost, they know the truth of their emotional relationship to the world. Liberals and social democrats currently have no way of addressing this. A lot of the time, they appear to be talking gobbledygook. 

 The populist right has found an emotive way to engage electorates by channelling their feelings, often displacing them onto someone else in the process. If you cannot look at yourself in the mirror – because anxiousness makes you feel weak and to be weak is to be a failed human being – you are prey to finding someone else to blame for your loss of dignity. In a world of competition, the only way to self-esteem is to be a winner. And someone else must therefore become the loser.
There is an alternative: a politics that begins with the notion that emotions do not have to be repressed or deformed into bigotry and abuse. An understanding of feelings that does not equate weakness with shame, and compassion with maladaptive weakness, is much more likely to suggest solutions than one that denies our emotional lives, most of what makes us human.
When people admit to their emotions, they call for empathy; they can galvanise action. ""And the government's name for a single mother raising two children and caring for her elderly father?"" Sophie Walker asked, in her conference speech, promptly supplying the (clearly absurd) answer: 'Economically inactive'. Walker's single mother is of no importance in the Trump/Farage fantasy land of winning, greatness, the deal, othering the outsider. The unpaid work of caring is about love; it entails vulnerability, which immediately makes it suspect in a world of winning and losing, in which the only permissible emotions are triumph and mocking schadenfreude. 

 The prevailing political mood of the moment is anxiety. ""To live a modern life anywhere in the world today,"" Mark Lilla wrote recently in the New York Times, ""subject to perpetual social and technological transformation, is to experience the psychological equivalent of permanent revolution. Anxiety in the face of this process is now a universal experience, which is why reactionary ideas attract adherents around the world who share little except their sense of historical betrayal."" 

 When liberals make pious noises about understanding the anxiety of constituents who have turned away from them, their solution often seems to entail taking on some of the bigotry. You don't have to look very far to find those who believe that feminism is inadequate to the task of humanising politics because it is, in fact, part of the problem. Lilla, in another piece in the New York Times, and Simon Jenkins, in the Guardian, have each argued that the policing of language and behaviour – which some call courtesy – has provoked a backlash and so must bear some of the blame for populism. The logical extension of this argument is that feminists, along with Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ activists and other assorted 'snowflakes', need to take a step back and think about just how much damage they're doing.
The problem is that this assumes white men's lives are neutral territory around which the common interest can coalesce. It is, in other words, male identity politics. ""There has been a massive backlash by white men,"" Sophie Walker told me, at the WE party headquarters in Bermondsey, a few weeks after the conference speech. ""We are living out the identity politics of the straight white man right now."" 

 If we are not to face a breakdown to essentialist tribal identities of gender and race, people have to find a way of articulating feelings of distress in a way that doesn't humiliate them. If men cannot face their anxiety, it will be denied, and then absolutely nothing will be done to alleviate it; there will be a privatisation of misery. There are structural reasons for the explosion of mental health disorders in advanced economies, for the opiate addiction in the rustbelt, the epidemic of distress among young people, other sorts of self-harm. But if we can't acknowledge the underlying dread and helplessness that people experience in the face of a world controlled by global finance capital and incomprehensible algorithms, individuals will continue to be stigmatised as failing. Either you will be a winner, an entrepreneurial individual competing freely in the market, deflecting your distress by manning up, lashing out; or your inchoate feelings of desperation will be – sorry – your problem, mate. 

 A female sensibility in politics is not, it probably needs saying, antithetical to reason, even though feeling and reason are often posited as opposites. Plato contrasted the wild horse of passion and the wise charioteer of reason (his point being, of course, that they needed each other). Jane Austen would have had no plots without the frequent difficulty human beings have in accommodating desire and wisdom: success, as she repeatedly shows, lies in the reconciliation of sense and sensibility. Such an accommodation requires self-examination, generosity of spirit, fidelity to self, and hard thinking. But first and foremost, it takes an honesty about feeling. 

 I used to get mildly irritated when feminists focused too hard on female representation, when there seemed so many other pressing things to talk about, as if vaginas alone made a difference. And it is true that there is a glass-ceiling feminism that takes little heed of women for whom race, class, disability and/or sexuality intersect to intensify and redouble gender discrimination. But sheer numbers of women do make a difference. Nicky Morgan notes that women in parliament are more inclined to collaborate across party than men. Sal Brinton, who has had a lifetime of being a lone woman on decision-making bodies, says that when women get to 40 per cent in a meeting or on a board, the language changes. There's a different way of conducting business, a different sense of how to move things on. In a hall overwhelmingly dominated by women, it is possible for a leader to cry and everyone to be on her side. For no one to think (after a moment of adjustment from unreconstructed be-more-like-a-man feminists like me) that you're weak. 

 Over the coming months and years, progressives are going to have to grapple with what kind of emotional appeal they can make beyond the populists' exploitative deformation of feeling. The task will be to retrieve emotion from its current co-option into a minatory, ultimately self-defeating way of looking at the world.  

 Women are not (of course) alone in identifying the need for soul in politics. Robert Musil and Stephen Toulmin, among others, have identified that there was a highly rationalistic and scientific turn in Enlightenment thinking after Descartes and Newton. Had the Enlightenment developed instead out of the vision of Montaigne, or Shakespeare, the thinking goes, it would have made more room for kindness, and would have given us a fuller, more complex and nuanced account of human experience. In the current destabilised times, people are returning to their ideas. 

 Perhaps women's activism can give us all a way into reconnecting with a different, more generous apprehension of the Enlightenment. By caring about caring, for example – not as an abstract problem that acts as a brake on the economy, but because caring is about love, family, community, humanity. By reminding men that it is possible to acknowledge pain and survive, and then get stronger. As the political ground shifts under our feet and old allegiances and responses turn out to be no use to us, we are going to need to find a different language of politics. And the language of women is where we should start.

52,"Women on the march
In the last weekend of November, Sophie Walker took to the stage at the Women's Equality Party's first conference to make her leader's speech and, within a few minutes, began weeping. She cried as she recounted the difficulties of being a single parent trying to access services for her autistic daughter: ""Finding out that no one was interested, no one cared, no one welcomed her as person who lived differently."" 

 This wasn't just a stray tear, brushed away. Walker (pictured above) seemed to be struggling to go on. The conference held its breath. I gripped the sides of my chair in a mixture of sympathy and embarrassment, thinking this wasn't going to go down well in the media, that she would be mocked for feebleness; what kind of leader, faced with an audience of hundreds, stands in front of them and cries at life's defeats? 

 It was only afterwards that it occurred to me that this had been one of the most significant, and, yes, persuasive moments of the entire event. Walker could hardly have made her point – that her daughter's diagnosis had punctured her own privilege as a white, university-educated journalist (and tall and beautiful, which she did not say but which is nevertheless probably relevant) – more tellingly. Her tears powerfully conveyed her devastation at feeling her child was destined, as she put it, either to be invisible or to be exposed, and the helplessness this induced.
The Women's Equality party conference was awash with talk about women 'doing politics differently'. The phrase was trotted out repeatedly, although it wasn't entirely clear what it actually meant. This week, as hundreds of thousands of women prepare to march on Washington on Saturday following the inauguration of Donald Trump (with marches in 200 other US cities and more than 50 others worldwide, including across the UK and in London, where Sophie Walker will be one of the speakers) this seems a good moment to try to pin down whether there is anything new about 21st-century women's activism and, if so, what it is. 

 There are two ways in which women might potentially 'do politics differently': policy, and practice. As far as the former is concerned, the Women's Equality party is promoting broad areas of policy capable of attracting women from across the traditional political spectrum, including closing the gender pay gap, subsidising childcare, ending violence against women, and equal representation in business, politics and the media. Detail and delivery would be more fraught, but, for now, these are things most women can get behind. Both Nicky Morgan, former Conservative Education Secretary, and Sal Brinton, President of the Liberal Democrats, spoke at the conference. 

 It is in its practice, though, that women's activism has real potential to enlarge our understanding of what it means to be political. 

 Among the variety of reasons for Brexit and Trump, rage was right up there. Emotion is back in fashion. The Brexiters and Trump eschewed rational arguments in favour of pleas to feeling. Trump is President of Emotions. (Sad!) Yet we are ill-equipped to understand this outbreak of feeling, as Pankaj Mishra argues in his forthcoming book, The Age of Anger, because our dominant intellectual concepts are incapable of comprehending the role of emotion in politics. 

 Since the Enlightenment, Mishra argues, our political thinking has been ever more tightly gripped by materialist, mechanistic premises – for example by the idea that ""humans are essentially rational and motivated by the pursuit of their own interests; that they principally act to maximise personal happiness, rather than on the basis of fear, anger and resentment.""

53,"Open Access: Casualties
Will a general shift to OA leave casualties?
                                         
                                          For example, will rising levels of green OA trigger cancellations of toll-access journals?
This question matters for those publishers (not all publishers) who fear the answer is yes and for those activists (not all activists) who hope the answer is yes. So far, unfortunately, it doesn’t have a simple yes-or-no answer, and most discussions replace evidence with fearful or hopeful predictions.
The primary drivers of green OA are policies at universities and funding agencies. Remember, all university policies allow publishers to protect themselves at will. (See section 4.1 on policies.) For example, universities with loophole or deposit mandates will not provide green OA when publishers do not allow it. Universities with Harvard-style rights-retention mandates will not provide OA when authors obtain waivers or when publishers require authors to obtain waivers as a condition of publication.
Hence, publishers who worry about the effect of university OA policies on subscriptions have the remedy in their own hands. Faculty needn’t paternalize publishers by voting down OA policies when publishers can protect themselves whenever they see the need to do so. The experience at Harvard since February 2008 is that very few publishers see the need to do so. Fewer than a handful systematically require waivers from Harvard authors.
This chapter, then, focuses on the strongest green OA mandates at funding agencies, like the Wellcome Trust and NIH, which allow no opt-outs for publishers or grantees. Will strong green OA policies of that kind trigger cancellations of toll-access journals? Here are 10 parts of any complete answer.
1. Nobody knows yet how green OA policies will affect journal subscriptions.
Rising levels of green OA may trigger toll-access journal cancellations, or they may not. So far they haven’t.
2. The evidence from physics is the most relevant.
Physics has the highest levels and longest history of green OA. The evidence from physics to date is that high levels of green OA don’t cause journal cancellations. On the contrary, the relationship between arXiv (the OA repository for physics) and toll-access physics journals is more symbiotic than antagonistic.
Physicists have been self-archiving since 1991, far longer than in any other field. In some subfields, such as particle physics, the rate of OA archiving approaches 100 percent, far higher than in any other field. If high-volume green OA caused journal cancellations, we’d see the effect first in physics. But it hasn’t happened. Two leading publishers of physics journals, the American Physical Society (APS) and Institute of Physics (IOP), have publicly acknowledged that they’ve seen no cancellations attributable to OA archiving. In fact, the APS and IOP have not only made peace with arXiv but now accept submissions from it and even host their own mirrors of it.
3. Other fields may not behave like physics.
We won’t know more until the levels of green OA in other fields approach those in physics.
It would definitely help to understand why the experience in physics has gone as it has and how far it might predict the experience in other fields. But so far it’s fair to say that we don’t know all the variables and that publishers who oppose green OA mandates are not among those showing a serious interest in them. When publisher lobbyists argue that high-volume green OA will undermine toll-access journal subscriptions, they don’t offer evidence, don’t acknowledge the countervailing evidence from physics, don’t rebut the evidence from physics, and don’t qualify their own conclusions in light of it. They would act more like scientific publishers if they acknowledged the evidence from physics and then argued, as well as they could, either that the experience in physics will change or that fields other than physics will have a different experience.
An October 2004 editorial in
The Lancet
(an Elsevier journal) called on the publishing lobby to do better. “[A]s editors of a journal that publishes research funded by the NIH, we disagree with [Association of American Publishers President Patricia Schroeder’s] central claim. Widening access to research [through green OA mandates] is unlikely to bring the edifice of scientific publishing crashing down. Schroeder provides no evidence that it would do so; she merely asserts the threat. This style of rebuttal will not do. . . .”
For more than eight years, green OA mandates have applied to research in many fields outside physics. These mandates are natural experiments and we’re still monitoring their effects. At Congressional hearings in 2008 and 2010, legislators asked publishers directly whether green OA was triggering cancellations. In both cases, publishers pointed to decreased downloads but not to increased cancellations.
4. There is evidence that green OA decreases downloads from publishers’ web sites.
When users know about OA and toll-access editions of the same article, many will prefer to click through to the OA edition, either because they aren’t affiliated with a subscribing institution or because authentication is a hassle. Moreover, when users find an OA edition, most stop looking. But decreased downloads are not the same thing as decreased or canceled subscriptions.
Moreover, decreased downloads of toll-access editions from publisher web sites are not the same thing as decreased downloads overall. No one suggests that green OA leads to decreased overall downloads, that is, fewer readers and less reading. On the contrary, the same evidence suggesting that OA increases citation impact also suggests that it increases readers and reading.
5. Most publishers voluntarily permit green OA.
Supplementing the natural experiments of green OA mandates are the natural experiments of publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. The Nature Publishing Group is more conservative than most toll-access publishers by requiring a six-month embargo on green OA, but more progressive than most by positively encouraging green OA. NPG reported the latest results of its multidisciplinary natural experiment in January 2011: “We have, to date, found author self-archiving compatible with subscription business models, and so we have been actively encouraging self-archiving since 2005.”
This or something similar to it must be the experience of the majority of toll-access publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. Even if they don’t actively encourage green OA, most permit it without embargo. If they found that it triggered cancellations, they would stop.
6. Green OA mandates leave standing at least four library incentives to maintain their subscriptions to toll-access journals.
Even the strongest no-loophole, no-waiver policies preserve incentives to maintain toll-access journal subscriptions.
First, all funder OA mandates include an embargo period to protect publishers. For example, the OA mandates at the Research Councils UK allow an embargo of up to six months after publication. The NIH allows an embargo of up to twelve months. Libraries wanting to provide immediate access will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Second, all funder OA mandates apply to the final version of the author’s peer-reviewed manuscript, not to the published version. If the journal provides copyediting after peer review, then the policies do not apply to the copyedited version, let alone to the formatted, paginated published edition. Libraries wanting to provide access to copyedited published editions will still have an incentive to subscribe.
The purpose of these two policy provisions is precisely to protect publishers against cancellations. They are deliberate concessions to publishers, adopted voluntarily by funding agencies as compromises with the public interest in immediate OA to the best editions. When we put the two together, we see that funder-mandated OA copies of peer-reviewed manuscripts won’t compete with toll-access copies of the published editions for six to twelve months, and there will never be OA copies of the more desirable published editions unless publishers voluntarily allow them. Publishers retain life-of-copyright exclusivity on the published editions. Even if OA archiving does eventually erode subscriptions outside physics, publishers have longer and better protection from these effects than their lobbyists ever acknowledge.
Third, funder OA mandates only apply to research articles, not to the many other kinds of content published in scholarly journals, such as letters, editorials, review articles, book reviews, announcements, news, conference information, and so on. Libraries wanting to provide access to these other kinds of content will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Fourth, funder OA mandates only apply to articles arising from research funded by the mandating agency. Very few journals publish nothing but articles from a single funder, or even from a set of funders all of whom have OA mandates. Libraries wanting to provide access to all the research articles in a journal, regardless of the sources of funding, will still have an incentive to subscribe. This incentive will weaken as more and more funders adopt OA mandates, but we’re very far from universal funder mandates. As we get closer, unfunded research will still fall outside this category and the three other incentives above will still stand.
The Association of College and Research Libraries addressed subscription incentives in a 2004 open letter on the NIH policy: “We wish to emphasize, above all, that academic libraries will not cancel journal subscriptions as a result of this plan. . . . Even if libraries wished to consider the availability of NIH-funded articles when making journal cancellation decisions, they would have no reasonable way of determining what articles in specific journals would become openly accessible after the embargo period.”
7. Some studies bear on the question of whether increased OA archiving will increase journal cancellations.
In a 2006 study from the Publishing Research Consortium (PRC), Chris Beckett and Simon Inger asked 400 librarians about the relative weight of different factors in their decisions to cancel subscriptions. Other things being equal, the librarians preferred free content to priced content and short embargoes to longer ones. Publishers interpret this to mean that the rise of OA archiving will cause cancellations. The chief flaw with the study is its artificiality. For example, the survey did not ask about specific journals by name but only about resources with abstractly stipulated levels of quality. It also disregarded faculty input on cancellation decisions when all librarians acknowledge that faculty input is decisive. The result was a study of hypothetical preferences, not actual cancellation decisions.
A less hypothetical study was commissioned by publishers themselves in the same year. From the summary:
The three most important factors used to determine journals for cancellation, in declining order of importance, are that the faculty no longer require it . . . , usage and price. Next, availability of the content via open access (OA) archives and availability via aggregators were ranked equal fourth, but some way behind the first three factors. The journal’s impact factor and availability via delayed OA were ranked relatively unimportant. . . . With regard to OA archives, there was a great deal of support for the idea that they would not directly impact journal subscriptions.
In short, toll-access journals have more to fear from their own price increases than from rising levels of green OA. Publishers who keep raising their prices aggravate the access problem for researchers and aggravate the sustainability problem for themselves. If the same publishers blame green OA and lobby against green OA policies, then they obstruct the solution for researchers and do very little to improve their own sustainability.
8. OA may increase submissions and subscriptions.
Some subscription journals have found that OA after an embargo period, even a very short one like two months, actually increases submissions and subscriptions. For example, this was the experience of the American Society for Cell Biology and its journal,
Molecular Biology of the Cell.
Medknow saw its submissions and subscriptions increase when it began offering unembargoed full-text editions of its journals alongside its toll-access print journals.
 
                                          Hindawi Publishing saw its submissions rise steadily after it converted all its peer-reviewed journals to OA in 2007. Looking back on several years of rapidly growing submissions, company founder and CEO Ahmed Hindawi said in January 2010, “It is clear now more than ever that our open access conversion . . . was the best management decision we have taken. . . .”
9. Some publishers fear that green OA will increase pressure to convert to gold OA.
Some publishers fear that rising levels of green OA will not only trigger toll-access journal cancellations but also increase pressure to convert to gold OA. (Likewise, some OA activists hope for this outcome.)
There are two responses to this two-fold fear. The fear of toll-access cancellations disregards the relevant evidence in points 1–8 above. The fear of conversion to gold OA also disregards relevant evidence, such as Ahmed Hindawi’s testimony above, and the testimony of Springer CEO Derk Haank. In 2008 when Springer bought BioMed Central and became the world’s largest OA publisher, Haank said: “[W]e see open access publishing as a sustainable part of STM publishing, and not an ideological crusade.” (Also see chapter 7 on economics.)
Publishers inexperienced with gold OA needn’t defer to publishers with more experience, but they should at least study them.
In fact, OA publishing might be more sustainable than TA publishing, as toll-access prices and the volume of research both grow faster than library budgets. (See section 2.1 on problems.) If publishers acknowledge that gold OA can be sustainable, and even profitable, and merely wish to avoid making lower margins than they make today, then their objection takes on a very different color. They’re not at risk of insolvency, just reduced profits, and they’re not asserting a need for self-protection, just an entitlement to current levels of profit. There’s no reason for public funding agencies acting in the public interest, or private funders acting for charitable purposes, to compromise their missions in order to satisfy that sense of publisher entitlement.
10. Green OA policies are justified even if they do create risks for toll-access journals.
If we’re only interested in the effect of rising levels of green OA on toll-access publishers, then we can stop at points 1–9. But if we’re interested in good policy, then we must add one more factor: Even if green OA does eventually threaten toll-access journal subscriptions, green OA policies are still justified.
I won’t elaborate this point here, since it takes us beyond the topic of casualties to the full case for OA, which is spread throughout the rest of the book. But here’s one way to put the debate in perspective: There are good reasons to want to know whether rising levels of green OA will trigger cancellations of toll-access journals, and perhaps even to modify our policies in light of what we learn. But there are no good reasons to put the thriving of incumbent toll-access journals and publishers ahead of the thriving of research itself.

                                          For example, will rising levels of green OA trigger cancellations of toll-access journals?
This question matters for those publishers (not all publishers) who fear the answer is yes and for those activists (not all activists) who hope the answer is yes. So far, unfortunately, it doesn’t have a simple yes-or-no answer, and most discussions replace evidence with fearful or hopeful predictions.
The primary drivers of green OA are policies at universities and funding agencies. Remember, all university policies allow publishers to protect themselves at will. (See section 4.1 on policies.) For example, universities with loophole or deposit mandates will not provide green OA when publishers do not allow it. Universities with Harvard-style rights-retention mandates will not provide OA when authors obtain waivers or when publishers require authors to obtain waivers as a condition of publication.
Hence, publishers who worry about the effect of university OA policies on subscriptions have the remedy in their own hands. Faculty needn’t paternalize publishers by voting down OA policies when publishers can protect themselves whenever they see the need to do so. The experience at Harvard since February 2008 is that very few publishers see the need to do so. Fewer than a handful systematically require waivers from Harvard authors.
This chapter, then, focuses on the strongest green OA mandates at funding agencies, like the Wellcome Trust and NIH, which allow no opt-outs for publishers or grantees. Will strong green OA policies of that kind trigger cancellations of toll-access journals? Here are 10 parts of any complete answer.
1. Nobody knows yet how green OA policies will affect journal subscriptions.
Rising levels of green OA may trigger toll-access journal cancellations, or they may not. So far they haven’t.
2. The evidence from physics is the most relevant.
Physics has the highest levels and longest history of green OA. The evidence from physics to date is that high levels of green OA don’t cause journal cancellations. On the contrary, the relationship between arXiv (the OA repository for physics) and toll-access physics journals is more symbiotic than antagonistic.
Physicists have been self-archiving since 1991, far longer than in any other field. In some subfields, such as particle physics, the rate of OA archiving approaches 100 percent, far higher than in any other field. If high-volume green OA caused journal cancellations, we’d see the effect first in physics. But it hasn’t happened. Two leading publishers of physics journals, the American Physical Society (APS) and Institute of Physics (IOP), have publicly acknowledged that they’ve seen no cancellations attributable to OA archiving. In fact, the APS and IOP have not only made peace with arXiv but now accept submissions from it and even host their own mirrors of it.
3. Other fields may not behave like physics.
We won’t know more until the levels of green OA in other fields approach those in physics.
It would definitely help to understand why the experience in physics has gone as it has and how far it might predict the experience in other fields. But so far it’s fair to say that we don’t know all the variables and that publishers who oppose green OA mandates are not among those showing a serious interest in them. When publisher lobbyists argue that high-volume green OA will undermine toll-access journal subscriptions, they don’t offer evidence, don’t acknowledge the countervailing evidence from physics, don’t rebut the evidence from physics, and don’t qualify their own conclusions in light of it. They would act more like scientific publishers if they acknowledged the evidence from physics and then argued, as well as they could, either that the experience in physics will change or that fields other than physics will have a different experience.
An October 2004 editorial in
The Lancet
(an Elsevier journal) called on the publishing lobby to do better. “[A]s editors of a journal that publishes research funded by the NIH, we disagree with [Association of American Publishers President Patricia Schroeder’s] central claim. Widening access to research [through green OA mandates] is unlikely to bring the edifice of scientific publishing crashing down. Schroeder provides no evidence that it would do so; she merely asserts the threat. This style of rebuttal will not do. . . .”
For more than eight years, green OA mandates have applied to research in many fields outside physics. These mandates are natural experiments and we’re still monitoring their effects. At Congressional hearings in 2008 and 2010, legislators asked publishers directly whether green OA was triggering cancellations. In both cases, publishers pointed to decreased downloads but not to increased cancellations.
4. There is evidence that green OA decreases downloads from publishers’ web sites.
When users know about OA and toll-access editions of the same article, many will prefer to click through to the OA edition, either because they aren’t affiliated with a subscribing institution or because authentication is a hassle. Moreover, when users find an OA edition, most stop looking. But decreased downloads are not the same thing as decreased or canceled subscriptions.
Moreover, decreased downloads of toll-access editions from publisher web sites are not the same thing as decreased downloads overall. No one suggests that green OA leads to decreased overall downloads, that is, fewer readers and less reading. On the contrary, the same evidence suggesting that OA increases citation impact also suggests that it increases readers and reading.
5. Most publishers voluntarily permit green OA.
Supplementing the natural experiments of green OA mandates are the natural experiments of publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. The Nature Publishing Group is more conservative than most toll-access publishers by requiring a six-month embargo on green OA, but more progressive than most by positively encouraging green OA. NPG reported the latest results of its multidisciplinary natural experiment in January 2011: “We have, to date, found author self-archiving compatible with subscription business models, and so we have been actively encouraging self-archiving since 2005.”
This or something similar to it must be the experience of the majority of toll-access publishers who voluntarily permit green OA. Even if they don’t actively encourage green OA, most permit it without embargo. If they found that it triggered cancellations, they would stop.
6. Green OA mandates leave standing at least four library incentives to maintain their subscriptions to toll-access journals.
Even the strongest no-loophole, no-waiver policies preserve incentives to maintain toll-access journal subscriptions.
First, all funder OA mandates include an embargo period to protect publishers. For example, the OA mandates at the Research Councils UK allow an embargo of up to six months after publication. The NIH allows an embargo of up to twelve months. Libraries wanting to provide immediate access will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Second, all funder OA mandates apply to the final version of the author’s peer-reviewed manuscript, not to the published version. If the journal provides copyediting after peer review, then the policies do not apply to the copyedited version, let alone to the formatted, paginated published edition. Libraries wanting to provide access to copyedited published editions will still have an incentive to subscribe.
The purpose of these two policy provisions is precisely to protect publishers against cancellations. They are deliberate concessions to publishers, adopted voluntarily by funding agencies as compromises with the public interest in immediate OA to the best editions. When we put the two together, we see that funder-mandated OA copies of peer-reviewed manuscripts won’t compete with toll-access copies of the published editions for six to twelve months, and there will never be OA copies of the more desirable published editions unless publishers voluntarily allow them. Publishers retain life-of-copyright exclusivity on the published editions. Even if OA archiving does eventually erode subscriptions outside physics, publishers have longer and better protection from these effects than their lobbyists ever acknowledge.
Third, funder OA mandates only apply to research articles, not to the many other kinds of content published in scholarly journals, such as letters, editorials, review articles, book reviews, announcements, news, conference information, and so on. Libraries wanting to provide access to these other kinds of content will still have an incentive to subscribe.
Fourth, funder OA mandates only apply to articles arising from research funded by the mandating agency. Very few journals publish nothing but articles from a single funder, or even from a set of funders all of whom have OA mandates. Libraries wanting to provide access to all the research articles in a journal, regardless of the sources of funding, will still have an incentive to subscribe. This incentive will weaken as more and more funders adopt OA mandates, but we’re very far from universal funder mandates. As we get closer, unfunded research will still fall outside this category and the three other incentives above will still stand.
The Association of College and Research Libraries addressed subscription incentives in a 2004 open letter on the NIH policy: “We wish to emphasize, above all, that academic libraries will not cancel journal subscriptions as a result of this plan. . . . Even if libraries wished to consider the availability of NIH-funded articles when making journal cancellation decisions, they would have no reasonable way of determining what articles in specific journals would become openly accessible after the embargo period.”
7. Some studies bear on the question of whether increased OA archiving will increase journal cancellations.
In a 2006 study from the Publishing Research Consortium (PRC), Chris Beckett and Simon Inger asked 400 librarians about the relative weight of different factors in their decisions to cancel subscriptions. Other things being equal, the librarians preferred free content to priced content and short embargoes to longer ones. Publishers interpret this to mean that the rise of OA archiving will cause cancellations. The chief flaw with the study is its artificiality. For example, the survey did not ask about specific journals by name but only about resources with abstractly stipulated levels of quality. It also disregarded faculty input on cancellation decisions when all librarians acknowledge that faculty input is decisive. The result was a study of hypothetical preferences, not actual cancellation decisions.
A less hypothetical study was commissioned by publishers themselves in the same year. From the summary:
The three most important factors used to determine journals for cancellation, in declining order of importance, are that the faculty no longer require it . . . , usage and price. Next, availability of the content via open access (OA) archives and availability via aggregators were ranked equal fourth, but some way behind the first three factors. The journal’s impact factor and availability via delayed OA were ranked relatively unimportant. . . . With regard to OA archives, there was a great deal of support for the idea that they would not directly impact journal subscriptions.
In short, toll-access journals have more to fear from their own price increases than from rising levels of green OA. Publishers who keep raising their prices aggravate the access problem for researchers and aggravate the sustainability problem for themselves. If the same publishers blame green OA and lobby against green OA policies, then they obstruct the solution for researchers and do very little to improve their own sustainability.
8. OA may increase submissions and subscriptions.
Some subscription journals have found that OA after an embargo period, even a very short one like two months, actually increases submissions and subscriptions. For example, this was the experience of the American Society for Cell Biology and its journal,
Molecular Biology of the Cell.
Medknow saw its submissions and subscriptions increase when it began offering unembargoed full-text editions of its journals alongside its toll-access print journals.
 
                                          Hindawi Publishing saw its submissions rise steadily after it converted all its peer-reviewed journals to OA in 2007. Looking back on several years of rapidly growing submissions, company founder and CEO Ahmed Hindawi said in January 2010, “It is clear now more than ever that our open access conversion . . . was the best management decision we have taken. . . .”
9. Some publishers fear that green OA will increase pressure to convert to gold OA.
Some publishers fear that rising levels of green OA will not only trigger toll-access journal cancellations but also increase pressure to convert to gold OA. (Likewise, some OA activists hope for this outcome.)
There are two responses to this two-fold fear. The fear of toll-access cancellations disregards the relevant evidence in points 1–8 above. The fear of conversion to gold OA also disregards relevant evidence, such as Ahmed Hindawi’s testimony above, and the testimony of Springer CEO Derk Haank. In 2008 when Springer bought BioMed Central and became the world’s largest OA publisher, Haank said: “[W]e see open access publishing as a sustainable part of STM publishing, and not an ideological crusade.” (Also see chapter 7 on economics.)
Publishers inexperienced with gold OA needn’t defer to publishers with more experience, but they should at least study them.
In fact, OA publishing might be more sustainable than TA publishing, as toll-access prices and the volume of research both grow faster than library budgets. (See section 2.1 on problems.) If publishers acknowledge that gold OA can be sustainable, and even profitable, and merely wish to avoid making lower margins than they make today, then their objection takes on a very different color. They’re not at risk of insolvency, just reduced profits, and they’re not asserting a need for self-protection, just an entitlement to current levels of profit. There’s no reason for public funding agencies acting in the public interest, or private funders acting for charitable purposes, to compromise their missions in order to satisfy that sense of publisher entitlement.
10. Green OA policies are justified even if they do create risks for toll-access journals.
If we’re only interested in the effect of rising levels of green OA on toll-access publishers, then we can stop at points 1–9. But if we’re interested in good policy, then we must add one more factor: Even if green OA does eventually threaten toll-access journal subscriptions, green OA policies are still justified.
I won’t elaborate this point here, since it takes us beyond the topic of casualties to the full case for OA, which is spread throughout the rest of the book. But here’s one way to put the debate in perspective: There are good reasons to want to know whether rising levels of green OA will trigger cancellations of toll-access journals, and perhaps even to modify our policies in light of what we learn. But there are no good reasons to put the thriving of incumbent toll-access journals and publishers ahead of the thriving of research itself.

54,"Open Access: Economics
Many publishers who oppose OA concede that OA is better for research and researchers than toll access.
 
                                          They merely object that we can’t pay for it. But we can pay for it.
The first major study of the economic impact of OA policies was conducted by John Houghton and Peter Sheehan in 2006. Using conservative estimates that a nation’s gross expenditure on research and development (GERD) brings social returns of 50 percent, and that OA increases access and efficiency by 5 percent, Houghton and Sheehan calculated that a transition to OA would not only pay for itself, but add $1.7 billion/year to the UK economy and $16 billion/year to the U.S. economy. A later study focusing on Australia used the more conservative estimate that GERD brings social returns of only 25 percent, but still found that the bottom-line economic benefits of OA for publicly funded research were 51 times greater than the costs.
Independent confirmation of Houghton’s results came in a major study released in April 2011, commissioned by the UK Joint Information Systems Committee, Publishing Research Consortium, Research Information Network, Research Libraries UK, and the Wellcome Trust. After studying five scenarios for improving research access, it concluded that green and gold OA “offer the greatest potential to policy-makers in promoting access. Both have positive, and potentially high, BCRs [benefit-cost ratios]. . . .”
The same study noted that “the infrastructure for Green [OA] has largely already been built” and therefore that “increasing access by this route is especially cost-effective. . . .” I can add that repositories scale up more easily than journals to capture unmet demand, and that depositing in a repository costs the depositor nothing. For all these reasons, I’ll focus in this chapter on how to pay for gold OA (journals), not how to pay for green OA (repositories).
Before turning to gold OA, however, I should note that there are widely varying estimates in the literature on what it costs a university to run an institutional repository. The divergence reflects the fact that repositories can serve many different purposes, and that some repositories serve more of them than others. If the minimum purpose is to host OA copies of faculty articles, and if faculty deposit their own articles, then the cost is minimal. But a repository is a general-purpose tool, and once launched there are good reasons for it to take on other responsibilities, such as long-term preservation, assisting faculty with digitization, permissions, and deposits, and hosting many other sorts of content, such as theses and dissertations, books or book chapters, conference proceedings, courseware, campus publications, digitized special collections, and administrative records. If the average repository is a significant expense today, the reason is that the average repository is doing significantly more than the minimum.
OA journals pay their bills the way broadcast television and radio stations do—not through advertising or pledge drives, but through a simple generalization on advertising and pledge drives. Those with an interest in disseminating the content pay the production costs upfront so that access can be free of charge for everyone with the right equipment. Elsewhere I’ve called this the “some pay for all” model.
Some OA journals have a subsidy from a university, library, foundation, society, museum, or government agency. Other OA journals charge a publication fee on accepted articles, to be paid by the author or the author’s sponsor (employer or funder). The party paying the subsidy or fee covers the journal’s expenses and readers pay nothing.
OA journals that charge publication fees tend to waive them in cases of economic hardship, and journals with institutional subsidies tend not to charge publication fees. OA journals can diversify their funding and get by on lower subsidies, or lower fees, if they also have revenue from print editions, advertising, priced add-ons, or auxiliary services. Some institutions and consortia arrange fee discounts, or purchase annual memberships that include fee waivers or discounts for all affiliated researchers.
Models that work well in some fields and nations may not work as well in others. No one claims that one size fits all. There’s still room for creativity in finding ways to pay the costs of a peer-reviewed OA journal, and many smart and motivated people are exploring different possibilities. Journals announce new variations almost every week, and we’re far from exhausting our cleverness and imagination.
Green OA may suffer from invisibility, but gold OA does not. On the contrary, researchers who don’t know about OA repositories still understand that there are OA journals. Sometimes the visibility gap is so large that researchers, journalists, and policy-makers conclude that all OA is gold OA (see section 3.1 on green and gold OA). As a result, most researchers who think about the benefits of OA think about the benefits of gold OA. Here, at least, the news is good. The most comprehensive survey to date shows that an overwhelming 89 percent of researchers from all fields believe that OA journals are beneficial to their fields.
Apart from the myth that all OA is gold OA, the most common myth about gold OA is that all OA journals charge “author fees” or use an “author-pays” business model. There are three mistakes here. The first is to assume that there is only one business model for OA journals, when there are many. The second is to assume that charging an upfront fee means authors are the ones expected to pay it. The third is to assume that all or even most OA journals charge upfront fees. In fact, most OA journals (70 percent) charge no upfront or author-side fees at all. By contrast, most toll-access journals (75 percent) do charge author-side fees. Moreover, even within the minority of fee-based OA journals, only 12 percent of those authors end up paying the fees out of pocket. Almost 90 percent of the time, the fees at fee-based journals are waived or paid by sponsors on behalf of authors.
Terminology
The terms “author fees” and “author pays” are specious and damaging. They’re false for the majority of OA journals, which charge no fees. They’re also misleading even for fee-based OA journals, where nearly nine times out of ten the fees are not paid by authors themselves. It’s more accurate to speak of “publication fees,” “processing fees,” or “author-side fees.” The first two don’t specify the payor, and the third merely specifies that the payment comes from the author side of the transaction, rather than the reader side, without implying that it must come from authors themselves.
The false beliefs that most OA journals charge author-side fees and that most toll-access journals don’t have caused several kinds of harm. They scare authors away from OA journals. They support the misconception that gold OA excludes indigent authors. When we add in the background myth that all OA is gold OA, this misconception suggests that OA as such—and not just gold OA—excludes indigent authors.
These false beliefs also support the insinuation that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. But if charging author-side fees for accepted papers really creates an incentive to lower standards, in order to rake in more fees, then most toll-access journals are guilty and most OA journals are not. In fact, however, when OA journals do charge author-side fees, they create firewalls between their financial and editorial operations. For example, most fee-based OA journals will waive their fees in cases of economic hardship, and take pains to prevent editors and referees engaged in peer review from knowing whether or not an author has requested a fee waiver. By contrast, at toll-access journals levying author-side page or color charges, editors generally know that accepted papers will entail revenue.
The false belief that most OA journals charge author-side fees also infects studies in which authors misinform survey subjects before surveying them. In effect: “At OA journals, authors pay to be published; now let me ask you a series of questions about your attitude toward OA journals.”
Finally, this false belief undermines calculations about who would bear the financial brunt if we made a general transition from toll-access journals to OA journals. A handful of studies have calculated that after a general conversion of peer-reviewed journals to OA, high-output universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. These calculations make at least two assumptions unjustified by present facts or trends: that all OA journals would charge fees, and that all fees would be paid by universities.
There are two kinds of OA journals, full and hybrid. Full OA journals provide OA to all their research articles. Hybrid OA journals provide OA to some and toll-access to others, when the choice is the author’s rather than the editor’s. Most hybrid OA journals charge a publication fee for the OA option. Authors who can find the money get immediate OA, and those who can’t or prefer not to, get toll access. (Many hybrid OA journals provide OA to all their articles after some time period, such as a year.) Some hybrid OA journals promise to reduce subscription prices in proportion to author uptake of the OA option, that is, to charge subscribers only for the toll-access articles. But most hybrid journal publishers don’t make this promise and “double dip” by charging subscription fees and publication fees for the same OA articles.
Hybrid OA is very low-risk for publishers. If the OA option has low uptake, the publisher loses nothing and still has subscription revenue. If it has high uptake, the publisher has subscription revenue for the conventional articles, publication fees for the OA articles, and sometimes both at once for the OA articles. Hence, the model has spread far and fast. The Professional/Scholarly Publishing division of the Association of American Publishers reported in 2011 that 74 percent of surveyed journals offering some form of OA in 2009 offered hybrid OA. At the same time, SHERPA listed more than 90 publishers offering hybrid OA options, including all of the largest publishers. Despite its spread, hybrid OA journals do little or nothing to help researchers, libraries, or publishers. The average rate of uptake for the OA option at hybrid journals is just 2 percent.
The chief virtue of hybrid OA journals is that they give publishers some firsthand experience with the economics and logistics of OA publishing. But the economics are artificial, since hybrid OA publishers have no incentive to increase author uptake and make the model succeed. The publishers always have subscriptions to fall back on. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of full-OA journals charge no publication fees and the overwhelming majority of hybrid-OA journals never gain firsthand experience with no-fee business models.
A growing number of for-profit OA publishers are making profits, and a growing number of nonprofit OA publishers are breaking even or making surpluses. Two different business models drive these sustainable publishing programs. BioMed Central makes profits and the Public Library of Science makes surpluses by charging publication fees. MedKnow makes profits without charging publication fees by selling priced print editions of its OA journals.
Fee-based OA journals tend to work best in fields where most research is funded, and no-fee journals tend to work best in fields and countries where comparatively little research is funded. The successes of these two business models give hope that gold OA can be sustainable in every discipline.
Every kind of peer-reviewed journal can become more sustainable by reducing costs. Although peer review is generally performed by unpaid volunteers, organizing or facilitating peer review is an expense. The journal must select referees, distribute files to referees, monitor who has what, track progress, nag dawdlers, collect comments and share them with the right people, facilitate communication, distinguish versions, and collect data on acceptances and rejections. One powerful way to reduce costs without reducing quality is to use free and open-source journal management software to automate the clerical tasks on this list.
The leader in this field is Open Journal Systems from the Public Knowledge Project, but there are more than a dozen other open-source packages. While OJS or other open-source software could benefit even toll-access journals, their use is concentrated among OA journals. OJS alone is has more than 9,000 installations (though not all are used for managing journals). This is not merely an example of how one openness movement can help another but also of how fearing openness can lead conventional publishers to forgo financial benefits and leave money on the table.
There are reasons to think that OA journals cost less to produce than toll-access journals of the same quality. OA journals dispense with subscription management (soliciting, negotiating, tracking, renewing subscribers), dispense with digital rights management (authenticating users, distinguishing authorized from unauthorized, blocking access to unauthorized), eliminate legal fees for licensing (drafting, negotiating, monitoring, and enforcing restrictive licenses), and reduce or eliminate marketing. In their place they add back little more than the cost of collecting publication fees or institutional subsidies. Several studies and OA publishers have testified to these lower costs.
We shouldn’t count the savings from dropping print, since most toll-access journals in the sciences have already dropped their print editions and those in the humanities are moving in the same direction.
We should be suspicious when large, venerable, conventional publishers say that in their experience the economics of OA publishing don’t work. Print-era publishers retooling for digital, and toll-access publishers retooling for OA, will inevitably realize smaller savings from OA than lean, mean OA start-ups without legacy equipment, personnel, or overhead from the age of print and subscriptions.
About one-quarter of all peer-reviewed journals today are OA. Like toll-access journals, some are in the black and thriving and some are in the red and struggling. However, the full range of OA journals begins to look like a success story when we consider that the vast majority of the money needed to support peer-reviewed journals is currently tied up in subscriptions to conventional journals. OA journals have reached their current numbers and quality despite the extraordinary squeeze on budgets devoted to the support of peer-reviewed journals.
Even if OA journals had the same production costs as toll-access journals, there’s enough money in the system to pay for peer-reviewed OA journals in every niche where we currently have peer-reviewed toll-access journals, and at the same level of quality. In fact, there’s more than enough, since we wouldn’t have to pay publisher profit margins surpassing those at ExxonMobil. Jan Velterop, the former publisher of BioMed Central, once said that OA publishing can be profitable but will “bring profit margins more in line with the added value.”
To support a full range of high-quality OA journals, we don’t need new money. We only need to redirect money we’re currently spending on peer-reviewed journals.
                                         
                                          There are many kinds of redirection. One is the voluntary conversion of toll-access journals to OA. Conversion could be a journal’s grudging response to declining library budgets for toll-access journals and exclusion from the big deals that take the lion’s share of library budgets. It could be a grudging response to its own past price increases and rising levels of green OA (see chapter 8 on casualties). Or it could be a hopeful and enthusiastic desire to achieve the benefits of OA for authors (greater audience and impact), readers (freedom from price and permission barriers), and publishers themselves (increased readership, citations, submissions, and quality).
Another kind of redirection is the rise of OA journal funds at universities. Even during times of declining budgets, libraries are setting aside money to pay publication fees at fee-based OA journals. The funds help faculty choose OA journals for their new work and help build a sustainable alternative to toll-access journals.
Redirection is also taking place on a large scale, primarily through CERN’s SCOAP3 project (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics). SCOAP3 is an ambitious plan to convert all the major toll-access journals in particle physics to OA, redirect the money formerly spent on reader-side subscription fees to author-side publication fees, and reduce the overall price to the journal-supporting institutions. It’s a peaceful revolution based on negotiation, consent, and self-interest. After four years of patiently building up budget pledges from libraries around the world, SCOAP3 entered its implementation phase in in April 2011.
If SCOAP3 succeeds, it won’t merely prove that CERN can pull off ambitious projects, which we already knew. It will prove that this particular ambitious project has an underlying win-win logic convincing to stakeholders. Some of the factors explaining the success of SCOAP3 to date are physics-specific, such as the small number of targeted journals, the green OA culture in physics embraced even by toll-access publishers, and the dominance of CERN. Other factors are not physics-specific, such as the evident benefits for research institutions, libraries, funders, and publishers. A success in particle physics would give hope that the model could be lifted and adapted to other fields without their own CERN-like institutions to pave the way. Other fields would not need CERN-like money or dominance so much as CERN-like convening power to bring the stakeholders to the table. Then the win-win logic would have a chance to take over from there.
Mark Rowse, former CEO of Ingenta, sketched another strategy for large-scale redirection in December 2003. A publisher could “flip” its toll-access journals to OA at one stroke by reinterpreting the payments it receives from university libraries as publication fees for a group of authors rather than subscription fees for a group of readers. One advantage over SCOAP3 is that the Rowsean flip can be tried one journal or one publisher at a time, and doesn’t require discipline-wide coordination. It could also scale up to the largest publishers or the largest coalitions of publishers.
We have to be imaginative but we don’t have to improvise. There are some principles we can try to follow. Money freed up by the cancellation or conversion of peer-reviewed TA journals should be spent first on peer-reviewed OA journals, to ensure the continuation of peer review. Large-scale redirection is more efficient than small-scale redirection. Peaceful revolution through negotiation and self-interest is more amicable and potentially more productive than adaptation forced by falling asteroids.
For the record, I advocate redirecting money freed up by cancellations or conversions, not canceling journals in order to free up money (except with SCOAP3 or Rowse-like consent and negotiation). This may look like hair-splitting, but the difference is neither small nor subtle. It’s roughly the difference between having great expectations and planning to kill your parents.

55,"The end of the web
In the past year, as we have witnessed the upending of the political order, the internet has been the theatre where many of the battles have been fought: from the hacking and leaking of Democratic party emails, to the proliferation of fake news and alternative facts, and yes, the outpourings of @realDonaldTrump. 

 With domestic and geopolitical tensions rising, governments are finding it increasingly hard to function amid a constant barrage of uncontrollable information and potential cyber-attacks, making them grow more wary both of the internet's influence and their ability to control it.
The fallout from this means we are facing the prospect of countries around the world pulling the plug on the open, global internet and creating their own independent networks. We might be about to see the end of the world wide internet as we know it.
With globalisation under attack, the ultimate bastion of borderlessness – the global internet – might very well be one the biggest scalps taken by the newly emerging world order heralded in by Brexit and Trump. If a global orthodoxy of free trade, soft power and international organisations is overpowered by belligerent nations and isolationism, the net will inevitably be swept away with it.
Yet although fragmentation – and ultimately also Balkanisation – will carry great social and economic cost, it could also be an opportunity. Europe, which has already been flexing its muscles when it comes to internet policy, now finds itself forced to rely less on US cooperation. It should therefore become a frontrunner in developing an alternative, decentralised internet, with its root values of fairness, openness and democracy restored. This could help the net – and indeed Europe – to become more resilient again. As much as we fear the 'splinternet', we should welcome the Euronet.
Weaponisation of the internet
Since we've become dependent on the internet for almost everything we do, dangers to the network's integrity threaten devastating effects. Governments may be tempted to turn inwards in an attempt to shield themselves and their citizens from cyber-attacks. 

 

 Last October, unknown hackers used an array of badly secured 'internet of things' (IoT) devices to bring down most of the internet on the east coast of America in one of the largest DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks to date. While depriving Americans of Amazon and Facebook for several hours was surely an inconvenience, the potential of the weaponised internet to do harm is infinitely greater. 

 

 As more of the components of a country's critical infrastructure move online, the number of possible targets grows too. Hackers shut down a significant part of Ukraine's electricity grid in 2015, and crippled several important Estonian industries, including its banks, in 2007.
Many cyber-security experts warn about the lacklustre defence of everything from air traffic control towers and voting machines to nuclear plants. One well-placed attack could do more damage than the most aggressive of traditional military campaigns, at a fraction of the cost. Because of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding cyber-capabilities – 'know your enemy' is a hard adage to follow if potential culprits and their capabilities are so tough to track – it has become impossible for governments to completely shield their countries from cyber-attacks. 

 

 The growing urge to control the internet has also become apparent over the influence of so-called fake news. Distorting public opinion and fact as a manipulation technique is nothing new: it's been used since Roman times. But the relentless pace and scope with which the internet allows information to disseminate is quite unprecedented. Governments and the media (who have themselves often swapped truth for clicks) are having an increasingly hard time stemming the flow of biased or misleading news stories. So the democratic process suffers. 

 

 The solutions offered by the reluctant tech giants providing a platform for fake news won't be sufficient to stop it altogether. This will prompt more countries to follow Russia and China in building their own platforms like VKontakte and Baidu, thus reducing foreign influence and allowing for extensive censorship and monitoring. The desire of developing countries to establish their own social networks will see them retreat into their own national bubbles.
Fragile infrastructure
While cyber attacks and false information campaigns use the internet to attack the infrastructure by which our societies function, the internet's own infrastructure is also at risk. Despite the internet's ephemeral, lawless appeal, its underlying network of cables, tubes and wires is very much rooted in the physical world. Over 99 per cent of all global internet communications are facilitated by an impressive web of undersea cables, connecting all corners of the world. A submarine deliberately destroying one of these cables in a hard-to-reach place could bring down access to parts of the internet for weeks; and so, by extension, all the systems that rely upon it. 

 

 The fallibility of this shared infrastructure also makes it impossible to keep foreign or hostile actors out of domestic affairs. Though governments that heavily restrict internet access might find it easier to prevent information from flowing in and out of the country, they are still reliant on the same co-owned systems, with some parts inevitably falling under other countries' jurisdictions. 

 This became very clear after the 2013 Snowden revelations, which showed that the US routinely tapped into foreign internet traffic routed through the country. The massive scale of this monitoring even led then president of Brazil Dilma Rousseff to call for the construction of an undersea cable from Brazil directly to Europe, bypassing the prying eyes of the National Security Agency altogether. And US intelligence agencies are by no means the only ones doing this kind of snooping, as we know all too well. 

 

 With various nations eyeing each other suspiciously and traditional alliances crumbling, building alternative structures to make foreign interference more difficult seems a logical consequence.
Who rules the internet?
It won't just be the actual infrastructure and 'hard' elements of the internet where governments will seek more independence. Internet governance, the catch-all term to describe the processes and decisions that determine how the internet is managed, and how its technical norms and standards are set, is increasingly complex. 

 

 In principle, no single actor should be in charge of the internet governance processes. Ideally, these should be overseen by a multi-stakeholder model where governments, the private sector and advocacy groups would have an equal voice and where anyone could be allowed to become involved. In practice, however, it is US government institutions and companies – yes, the usual suspects – that set the rules. They tend to be over-represented in meetings, and in charge of some of the largest regulatory bodies. American stewardship over the internet has long been an area of contention. Countries like China, Russia, and many (mainly developing) countries want more control over their own domestic networks, preferring to see the current model replaced by something more Westphalian, perhaps resembling the United Nations. 

 This discussion will likely flair up again soon as the Trump administration seeks ways to reverse the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) transition: an arcane but highly controversial policy issue. IANA is the agency in charge of maintaining the global DNS (Domain Name System) as well as managing Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation and other important basic structural functions of the internet. The internet’s IANA functions had traditionally been managed by the non-profit ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), but remained under contract of the US Department of Commerce, which oversaw its processes – effectively leaving it under US government control. After almost 20 years of bickering and international kowtowing, IANA was brought under full ICANN control last October, finally becoming fully independent. This to the great dismay of many Republican lawmakers; particularly senator Ted Cruz, who has been fighting to stop the process for years. 

 If the US government does decide to overturn the transition (and Trump has certainly shown enthusiasm for overturning decisions of the previous administration), it will do a lot of damage to the American-led governance process. How much credibility can it have when the most important partner doesn't even play by the rules? 

 As these tensions increase, we'll likely see a push for more government bodies to take control of internet governance (such as the short-lived, Brazil-led NETMundial initiative), abandoning the more inclusive and cooperative approach involving businesses and civil society organisations. Then if the process fell even further apart, it would be a substantial challenge to the interoperable global internet, as regulations and standards swiftly went in different directions.
The Big Four
Though the internet was initially heralded as the greatest democratiser of information since Gutenberg, most data now flows through only a handful of companies. Silicon Valley tech giants, with the 'Big Four' of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon at the helm, rake in most of the spoils of the all-conquering global online economy. 

 In their ambition to expand even further, these tech companies are themselves also an important cause of internet fragmentation, erecting 'walled gardens' all over the world. Facebook's controversial Free Basics service, which offers free data plans to users in developing countries, but which restricts access to a small number of Facebook-approved websites, is a prime example. Some call it digital colonialism. 

 These moves aimed at generating even more revenue, concentrated in the hands of the few as inequality rises, understandably cause concern among governments and citizens alike. But our main worry should not be about economics. The Big Four – controlling our data, as well as our access to information – wield an inordinate amount of power. Indeed, Denmark recently announced it would appoint a igital ambassador specifically to deal with these technology giants, citing their influence as larger than that of many countries. 

 Citizens worldwide have become so dependent on these platforms that there are effectively no readily available alternatives to move to if things turn sour. The sheer scale of the Women's March and similar demonstrations in recent weeks would not have been possible without the ability to organise online. What if these channels fall away, their freedom restricted by companies under the yoke of a hostile government? 

 Though many American technology companies have already pledged they will not assist with the creation of a 'Muslim registry' – and have pushed back on Trump’s latest immigration restrictions
–
we have to be very aware that the amount of personal data they have on each of us would make it far too easy for them to do so. 

 Foreign governments, which in the current political climate cannot rely on Google abiding by its mantra, 'Don't be evil', will aggressively start to pursue the construction of domestic alternatives. It is something we are already seeing happening worldwide.
The splinternet
Though the dream of the web internet pioneers was one of a completely open, non-hierarchical internet, over the years barriers have been springing up that restrict this freedom. Bit by bit, the internet is becoming more cordoned off.  

 The idea of splitting up the internet into different, Balkanised internets – with a completely separate infrastructure – is not new. After the Snowden revelations, Germany took action and started looking into the construction of the 'Internetz', a German-only network (although one that allows for the possibility of expanding to the rest of the EU). 

 We do not currently have an example of a real internet island in place, but the closest version we see is probably the Great Firewall of China. Though China hasn't built an entirely separate infrastructure, its internet looks entirely different from what we are used to, with content heavily censored and many platforms and websites completely banned. 

 Russia appears to be following suit. Last November, Russia banned LinkedIn from operating in the country because the social network did not adhere to a new law decreeing that all data generated by Russian users should be stored within Russia itself. In recent weeks, news has also emerged that Moscow has been working with Beijing to implement something similar to the Great Firewall for its own domestic users. Democracies and autocracies alike have long come to understand the great power of the internet and have learned how to both harness and restrict it. 

 Who will be the first to go it alone? It's difficult to say yet but the usual suspects are lining up: China; Russia; Europe; even Trump's America
.
Other countries like Brazil or Turkey might see a compelling reason to do so as well. 

 Now that we are so used to a ubiquitous and global internet, it's hard to imagine what a world of fragmented, national internets might look like. What we do know is that the internet of fun and games, of unfettered access, is quickly coming to an end. When it does, it will be another big nail in the coffin for globalisation.
Breaking free
The idea of a Balkanised internet, of different national and supranational internet islands, is a dark one. What living in such a future would look like, no one knows. Inevitably, though, it would herald a world of less mutual understanding, less shared prosperity and shrinking horizons. 

 However, the fragmentation of the internet need not be bad news. As the limitations of its original incarnation are becoming increasingly clear, starting from scratch provides us with an important opportunity to right our initial wrongs. We can build a network or networks that are more ethical, inclusive and resilient to outside threats. 

 While this is a moment of disharmony and uncertainty for the European project, the EU has much it agrees upon when it comes to policy and regulating the internet's mostly American corporate giants: from its ambitious data protection policies and the right to be forgotten, to Apple tax case. But it could do more. The global internet as we know it today began as a public space where everyone had an equal opportunity to use it as we liked. But it has quickly privatised, locking us into platforms that 'harvest' our data. As European citizens grow increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of the internet, the EU has a great opportunity. 

 The EU should take a different approach to the internet and, rather than making it an unregulated free-for-all, consider it a 'commons': a public good open to all, excluding none. The EU could create and fund the infrastructure for this and help ensure safety for all. Meanwhile, small businesses and individuals would do their bit by creating a variety of tools to add to this commons, which would become fully interoperable through shared standards and underpinning technologies. 

 One necessary component of such an internet commons is that it should be decentralised. Decentralising the internet and rethinking its structure would allow users to take back control over the network of networks, letting them manage their own personal data rather than giving it away to large companies, as well as offering them more choice over the tools they use. It is also often said that distributed internets would also inherently be much safer: largescale cyber-attacks are easier to prevent if we reduce the number of central nodes that traffic can travel through. 

 But a European internet would above all need to be radically ambitious – especially with the EU in a fractured state. The rules for the decentralised, new internet are still wide open, and we have the opportunity to set them. The emergence of a new world order is forcing Europe to rethink itself, come closer together and defend its values in the world. Creating a completely new internet built around these values – and open to any like-minded country to join – might be one extraordinarily effective way of achieving it.

Yet although fragmentation – and ultimately also Balkanisation – will carry great social and economic cost, it could also be an opportunity. Europe, which has already been flexing its muscles when it comes to internet policy, now finds itself forced to rely less on US cooperation. It should therefore become a frontrunner in developing an alternative, decentralised internet, with its root values of fairness, openness and democracy restored. This could help the net – and indeed Europe – to become more resilient again. As much as we fear the 'splinternet', we should welcome the Euronet.
Weaponisation of the internet
Since we've become dependent on the internet for almost everything we do, dangers to the network's integrity threaten devastating effects. Governments may be tempted to turn inwards in an attempt to shield themselves and their citizens from cyber-attacks. 

 

 Last October, unknown hackers used an array of badly secured 'internet of things' (IoT) devices to bring down most of the internet on the east coast of America in one of the largest DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attacks to date. While depriving Americans of Amazon and Facebook for several hours was surely an inconvenience, the potential of the weaponised internet to do harm is infinitely greater. 

 

 As more of the components of a country's critical infrastructure move online, the number of possible targets grows too. Hackers shut down a significant part of Ukraine's electricity grid in 2015, and crippled several important Estonian industries, including its banks, in 2007.
Many cyber-security experts warn about the lacklustre defence of everything from air traffic control towers and voting machines to nuclear plants. One well-placed attack could do more damage than the most aggressive of traditional military campaigns, at a fraction of the cost. Because of the high degree of uncertainty surrounding cyber-capabilities – 'know your enemy' is a hard adage to follow if potential culprits and their capabilities are so tough to track – it has become impossible for governments to completely shield their countries from cyber-attacks. 

 

 The growing urge to control the internet has also become apparent over the influence of so-called fake news. Distorting public opinion and fact as a manipulation technique is nothing new: it's been used since Roman times. But the relentless pace and scope with which the internet allows information to disseminate is quite unprecedented. Governments and the media (who have themselves often swapped truth for clicks) are having an increasingly hard time stemming the flow of biased or misleading news stories. So the democratic process suffers. 

 

 The solutions offered by the reluctant tech giants providing a platform for fake news won't be sufficient to stop it altogether. This will prompt more countries to follow Russia and China in building their own platforms like VKontakte and Baidu, thus reducing foreign influence and allowing for extensive censorship and monitoring. The desire of developing countries to establish their own social networks will see them retreat into their own national bubbles.
Fragile infrastructure
While cyber attacks and false information campaigns use the internet to attack the infrastructure by which our societies function, the internet's own infrastructure is also at risk. Despite the internet's ephemeral, lawless appeal, its underlying network of cables, tubes and wires is very much rooted in the physical world. Over 99 per cent of all global internet communications are facilitated by an impressive web of undersea cables, connecting all corners of the world. A submarine deliberately destroying one of these cables in a hard-to-reach place could bring down access to parts of the internet for weeks; and so, by extension, all the systems that rely upon it. 

 

 The fallibility of this shared infrastructure also makes it impossible to keep foreign or hostile actors out of domestic affairs. Though governments that heavily restrict internet access might find it easier to prevent information from flowing in and out of the country, they are still reliant on the same co-owned systems, with some parts inevitably falling under other countries' jurisdictions. 

 This became very clear after the 2013 Snowden revelations, which showed that the US routinely tapped into foreign internet traffic routed through the country. The massive scale of this monitoring even led then president of Brazil Dilma Rousseff to call for the construction of an undersea cable from Brazil directly to Europe, bypassing the prying eyes of the National Security Agency altogether. And US intelligence agencies are by no means the only ones doing this kind of snooping, as we know all too well. 

 

 With various nations eyeing each other suspiciously and traditional alliances crumbling, building alternative structures to make foreign interference more difficult seems a logical consequence.
Who rules the internet?
It won't just be the actual infrastructure and 'hard' elements of the internet where governments will seek more independence. Internet governance, the catch-all term to describe the processes and decisions that determine how the internet is managed, and how its technical norms and standards are set, is increasingly complex. 

 

 In principle, no single actor should be in charge of the internet governance processes. Ideally, these should be overseen by a multi-stakeholder model where governments, the private sector and advocacy groups would have an equal voice and where anyone could be allowed to become involved. In practice, however, it is US government institutions and companies – yes, the usual suspects – that set the rules. They tend to be over-represented in meetings, and in charge of some of the largest regulatory bodies. American stewardship over the internet has long been an area of contention. Countries like China, Russia, and many (mainly developing) countries want more control over their own domestic networks, preferring to see the current model replaced by something more Westphalian, perhaps resembling the United Nations. 

 This discussion will likely flair up again soon as the Trump administration seeks ways to reverse the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) transition: an arcane but highly controversial policy issue. IANA is the agency in charge of maintaining the global DNS (Domain Name System) as well as managing Internet Protocol (IP) address allocation and other important basic structural functions of the internet. The internet’s IANA functions had traditionally been managed by the non-profit ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), but remained under contract of the US Department of Commerce, which oversaw its processes – effectively leaving it under US government control. After almost 20 years of bickering and international kowtowing, IANA was brought under full ICANN control last October, finally becoming fully independent. This to the great dismay of many Republican lawmakers; particularly senator Ted Cruz, who has been fighting to stop the process for years. 

 If the US government does decide to overturn the transition (and Trump has certainly shown enthusiasm for overturning decisions of the previous administration), it will do a lot of damage to the American-led governance process. How much credibility can it have when the most important partner doesn't even play by the rules? 

 As these tensions increase, we'll likely see a push for more government bodies to take control of internet governance (such as the short-lived, Brazil-led NETMundial initiative), abandoning the more inclusive and cooperative approach involving businesses and civil society organisations. Then if the process fell even further apart, it would be a substantial challenge to the interoperable global internet, as regulations and standards swiftly went in different directions.
The Big Four
Though the internet was initially heralded as the greatest democratiser of information since Gutenberg, most data now flows through only a handful of companies. Silicon Valley tech giants, with the 'Big Four' of Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon at the helm, rake in most of the spoils of the all-conquering global online economy. 

 In their ambition to expand even further, these tech companies are themselves also an important cause of internet fragmentation, erecting 'walled gardens' all over the world. Facebook's controversial Free Basics service, which offers free data plans to users in developing countries, but which restricts access to a small number of Facebook-approved websites, is a prime example. Some call it digital colonialism. 

 These moves aimed at generating even more revenue, concentrated in the hands of the few as inequality rises, understandably cause concern among governments and citizens alike. But our main worry should not be about economics. The Big Four – controlling our data, as well as our access to information – wield an inordinate amount of power. Indeed, Denmark recently announced it would appoint a igital ambassador specifically to deal with these technology giants, citing their influence as larger than that of many countries. 

 Citizens worldwide have become so dependent on these platforms that there are effectively no readily available alternatives to move to if things turn sour. The sheer scale of the Women's March and similar demonstrations in recent weeks would not have been possible without the ability to organise online. What if these channels fall away, their freedom restricted by companies under the yoke of a hostile government? 

 Though many American technology companies have already pledged they will not assist with the creation of a 'Muslim registry' – and have pushed back on Trump’s latest immigration restrictions
–
we have to be very aware that the amount of personal data they have on each of us would make it far too easy for them to do so. 

 Foreign governments, which in the current political climate cannot rely on Google abiding by its mantra, 'Don't be evil', will aggressively start to pursue the construction of domestic alternatives. It is something we are already seeing happening worldwide.
The splinternet
Though the dream of the web internet pioneers was one of a completely open, non-hierarchical internet, over the years barriers have been springing up that restrict this freedom. Bit by bit, the internet is becoming more cordoned off.  

 The idea of splitting up the internet into different, Balkanised internets – with a completely separate infrastructure – is not new. After the Snowden revelations, Germany took action and started looking into the construction of the 'Internetz', a German-only network (although one that allows for the possibility of expanding to the rest of the EU). 

 We do not currently have an example of a real internet island in place, but the closest version we see is probably the Great Firewall of China. Though China hasn't built an entirely separate infrastructure, its internet looks entirely different from what we are used to, with content heavily censored and many platforms and websites completely banned. 

 Russia appears to be following suit. Last November, Russia banned LinkedIn from operating in the country because the social network did not adhere to a new law decreeing that all data generated by Russian users should be stored within Russia itself. In recent weeks, news has also emerged that Moscow has been working with Beijing to implement something similar to the Great Firewall for its own domestic users. Democracies and autocracies alike have long come to understand the great power of the internet and have learned how to both harness and restrict it. 

 Who will be the first to go it alone? It's difficult to say yet but the usual suspects are lining up: China; Russia; Europe; even Trump's America
.
Other countries like Brazil or Turkey might see a compelling reason to do so as well. 

 Now that we are so used to a ubiquitous and global internet, it's hard to imagine what a world of fragmented, national internets might look like. What we do know is that the internet of fun and games, of unfettered access, is quickly coming to an end. When it does, it will be another big nail in the coffin for globalisation.
Breaking free
The idea of a Balkanised internet, of different national and supranational internet islands, is a dark one. What living in such a future would look like, no one knows. Inevitably, though, it would herald a world of less mutual understanding, less shared prosperity and shrinking horizons. 

 However, the fragmentation of the internet need not be bad news. As the limitations of its original incarnation are becoming increasingly clear, starting from scratch provides us with an important opportunity to right our initial wrongs. We can build a network or networks that are more ethical, inclusive and resilient to outside threats. 

 While this is a moment of disharmony and uncertainty for the European project, the EU has much it agrees upon when it comes to policy and regulating the internet's mostly American corporate giants: from its ambitious data protection policies and the right to be forgotten, to Apple tax case. But it could do more. The global internet as we know it today began as a public space where everyone had an equal opportunity to use it as we liked. But it has quickly privatised, locking us into platforms that 'harvest' our data. As European citizens grow increasingly concerned about the negative impacts of the internet, the EU has a great opportunity. 

 The EU should take a different approach to the internet and, rather than making it an unregulated free-for-all, consider it a 'commons': a public good open to all, excluding none. The EU could create and fund the infrastructure for this and help ensure safety for all. Meanwhile, small businesses and individuals would do their bit by creating a variety of tools to add to this commons, which would become fully interoperable through shared standards and underpinning technologies. 

 One necessary component of such an internet commons is that it should be decentralised. Decentralising the internet and rethinking its structure would allow users to take back control over the network of networks, letting them manage their own personal data rather than giving it away to large companies, as well as offering them more choice over the tools they use. It is also often said that distributed internets would also inherently be much safer: largescale cyber-attacks are easier to prevent if we reduce the number of central nodes that traffic can travel through. 

 But a European internet would above all need to be radically ambitious – especially with the EU in a fractured state. The rules for the decentralised, new internet are still wide open, and we have the opportunity to set them. The emergence of a new world order is forcing Europe to rethink itself, come closer together and defend its values in the world. Creating a completely new internet built around these values – and open to any like-minded country to join – might be one extraordinarily effective way of achieving it.
