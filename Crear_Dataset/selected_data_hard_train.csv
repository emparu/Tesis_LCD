         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.) 

         Mehta's writerly persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late '70s (plagiarism, frozen turbot), the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor, the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse (""We all took fright"") and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: Tinaji. 

          Lillian Ross, by contrast, takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation. Indeed, the new editor even coaxed Ross into re-joining the magazine, just as she was booting Mehta out. ""I found that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of Bill's kind of naivete, insight, and sensitivity,"" Ross says of Brown. ""She, too, 'got it.' "" A few months after Brown was appointed editor, Shawn died at the age of 85. He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine, in sorrow and relief. That's if you believe Mehta. Ross assures us that Mr. Shawn was reading Tina Brown's New Yorker ""with new interest"" in the weeks prior to his death. 

         Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn, as Mehta fiercely believes, or has she continued and built upon it, as Ross is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this.

Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.) 

         Mehta's writerly persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late '70s (plagiarism, frozen turbot), the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor, the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse (""We all took fright"") and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: Tinaji. 

          Lillian Ross, by contrast, takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation. Indeed, the new editor even coaxed Ross into re-joining the magazine, just as she was booting Mehta out. ""I found that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of Bill's kind of naivete, insight, and sensitivity,"" Ross says of Brown. ""She, too, 'got it.' "" A few months after Brown was appointed editor, Shawn died at the age of 85. He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine, in sorrow and relief. That's if you believe Mehta. Ross assures us that Mr. Shawn was reading Tina Brown's New Yorker ""with new interest"" in the weeks prior to his death. 

         Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn, as Mehta fiercely believes, or has she continued and built upon it, as Ross is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this.

0,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... !

1,"Human Clones: Why Not? 

         If you can clone a sheep, you can almost certainly clone a human being. Some of the most powerful people in the world have felt compelled to act against this threat. President Clinton swiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for human-cloning research. Bills are in the works in both houses of Congress to outlaw human cloning--a step urged on all governments by the pope himself. Cloning humans is taken to be either 1) a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or, at the very least, 2) a complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation. But what, exactly, is so bad about it? 

         Start by asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce. I say ""yes."" I have no moral right to tell other people they shouldn't be able to have children, and I don't see that Bill Clinton has that right either. When Clinton says, ""Let us resist the temptation to copy ourselves,"" it comes from a man not known for resisting other temptations of the flesh. And for a politician, making noise about cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself. It's an easy way to show sound-bite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking about, without much risk of bitter consequences. After all, how much federally funded research was stopped by this ban? Probably almost none, because Clinton has maintained Ronald Reagan's policy of minimizing federal grants for research in human reproduction. Besides, most researchers thought cloning humans was impossible--so, for the moment, there's unlikely to be a grant-request backlog. There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership. 

         The pope, unlike the president, is known for resisting temptation. He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduce. I respect the pope's freedom to lead his religion, and his followers' freedom to follow his dictate. But calling for secular governments to implement a ban, thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade, shows rather explicitly that the pope does not respect the freedom of others. The basic religious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago. Sheep feature prominently in the Bible, but cloning does not. So the pope's views on cloning are 1 st century rules applied using 15 th century religious thinking to a 21 st century issue. 

         If humans have a right to reproduce, what right does society have to limit the means? Essentially all reproduction is done these days with medical help--at delivery, and often before. Truly natural human reproduction would mean 50 percent infant mortality and make pregnancy-related death the No. 1 killer of adult women. 

         True, some forms of medical help are more invasive than others. With in vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combined in the lab and surgically implanted in the womb. Less than two decades ago, a similar concern was raised over the ethical issues involved in ""test-tube babies."" To date, nearly 30,000 such babies have been born in the United States alone. Many would-be parents have been made happy. Who has been harmed? 

          The cloning procedure is similar to IVF. The only difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA from an adult cell. What law or principle--secular, humanist, or religious--says that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK, but another is not? No matter how closely you study the 1 st century texts, I don't think you'll find the answer. 

         Even if people have the right to do it, is cloning a good idea? Suppose that every prospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally, and instead produced clones of themselves. What would the world be like in another 20 or 30 years? The answer is: much like today. Cloning would only copy the genetic aspects of people who are already here. Hating a world of clones is hating the current populace. Never before was Pogo so right: We have met the enemy, and he is us ! 

         Adifferent scare scenario is a world filled with copies of famous people only. We'll treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes, hankering for Michael Jordan's genes the way we covet his Nike sneakers today. But even celebrity infatuation has its limits. People are not more taken with celebrities than they are with themselves. Besides, such a trend would correct itself in a generation or two, because celebrity is closely linked to rarity. The world seems amused by one Howard Stern, but give us a hundred or a million of them, and they'll seem a lot less endearing. 

         Clones already exist. About one in every 1,000 births results in a pair of babies with the same DNA. We know them as identical twins. Scientific studies on such twins--reared together or apart--show that they share many characteristics. Just how many they share is a contentious topic in human biology. But genetic determinism is largely irrelevant to the cloning issue. Despite how many or how few individual characteristics twins--or other clones--have in common, they are different people in the most fundamental sense . They have their own identities, their own thoughts, and their own rights. Should you be confused on this point, just ask a twin. 

         Suppose that Unsolved Mysteries called you with news of a long-lost identical twin. Would that suddenly make you less of a person, less of an individual? It is hard to see how. So, why would a clone be different? Your clone would be raised in a different era by different people--like the lost identical twin, only younger than you. A person's basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into this world, or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA. 

         Twins aren't the only clones in everyday life. Think about seedless grapes or navel oranges--if there are no seeds, where did they come from? It's the plant equivalent of virgin birth--which is to say that they are all clones, propagated by cutting a shoot and planting it. Wine is almost entirely a cloned product. The grapes used for wine have seeds, but they've been cloned from shoots for more than a hundred years in the case of many vineyards. The same is true for many flowers. Go to a garden store, and you'll find products with delightful names like ""Olivia's Cloning Compound,"" a mix of hormones to dunk on the cut end of a shoot to help it take root. 

          One recurring image in anti-cloning propaganda is of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors. Excuse me, but who is going to raise such an army (""raise"" in the sense used by parents)? Clones start out life as babies . Armies are far easier to raise the old fashioned way--by recruiting or drafting naive young adults. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young men to their deaths through the ages. Why mess with success? 

         Remember that cloning is not the same as genetic engineering. We don't get to make superman--we have to find him first. Maybe we could clone the superwarrior from Congressional Medal of Honor winners. Their bravery might--or might not--be genetically determined. But, suppose that it is. You might end up with such a brave battalion of heroes that when a grenade lands in their midst, there is a competition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others. Admirable perhaps, but not necessarily the way to win a war. And what about the supply sergeants? The army has a lot more of them than heroes. You could try to breed an expert for every job, including the petty bureaucrats, but what's the point? There's not exactly a shortage of them. 

         What if Saddam Hussein clones were to rule Iraq for another thousand years? Sounds bad, but Saddam's natural son Uday is reputed to make his father seem saintly by comparison. We have no more to fear from a clone of Saddam, or of Hitler, than we do from their natural-born kin--which is to say, we don't have much to fear: Dictators' kids rarely pose a problem. Stalin's daughter retired to Arizona, and Kim Jong Il of North Korea is laughable as Great Leader, Version 2.0. 

         The notion of an 80-year-old man cloning himself to cheat death is quaint, but it is unrealistic. First, the baby wouldn't really be him. Second, is the old duffer really up to changing diapers? A persistent octogenarian might convince a younger couple to have his clone and raise it, but that is not much different from fathering a child via a surrogate mother. 

          Fear of clones is just another form of racism. We all agree it is wrong to discriminate against people based on a set of genetic characteristics known as ""race."" Calls for a ban on cloning amount to discrimination against people based on another genetic trait--the fact that somebody already has an identical DNA sequence. The most extreme form of discrimination is genocide--seeking to eliminate that which is different. In this case, the genocide is pre-emptive--clones are so scary that we must eliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation. 

         What is so special about natural reproduction anyway? Cloning is the only predictable way to reproduce, because it creates the identical twin of a known adult. Sexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparison--some random mix of mom and dad. In evolutionary theory, this combination is thought to help stir the gene pool, so to speak. However, evolution for humans is essentially over, because we use medical science to control the death rate. 

         Whatever the temptations of cloning, the process of natural reproduction will always remain a lot more fun. An expensive and uncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex. The people most likely to clone will be those in special circumstances--infertile couples who must endure IVF anyway, for example. Even there, many will mix genetics to mimic nature. Another special case is where one member of a couple has a severe genetic disease. They might choose a clone of the healthy parent, rather than burden their child with a joint heritage that could be fatal. 

         The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn't superwarriors or dictators. It's that rich people with big egos will clone themselves. The common practice of giving a boy the same name as his father or choosing a family name for a child of either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality. Clones may resonate with this instinct and cause some people to reproduce this way. So what? Rich and egotistic folks do all sorts of annoying things, and the law is hardly the means with which to try and stop them. 

          The ""deep ethical issues"" about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy. Economic jealousy is bad enough, and it is a factor here, but the thing that truly drives people crazy is sexual jealousy. Eons of evolution through sexual selection have made the average man or woman insanely jealous of any interloper who gains a reproductive advantage--say by diddling your spouse. Cloning is less personal than cuckoldry, but it strikes a similar chord: Someone has got the reproductive edge on you. 

         Once the fuss has died down and further animal research has paved the way, direct human cloning will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions in human reproduction, affecting only a tiny fraction of the population. Research into this area could bring far wider benefits. Clinton's knee-jerk policy changes nothing in the short run, but it is ultimately a giant step backward. In using an adult cell to create a clone, the ""cellular clock"" that determines the difference between an embryo and adult was somehow reset. Work in this area might help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to reset the clocks in some of our own cells, allowing us to regenerate. Selfishly speaking, that would be more exciting to me than cloning, because it would help me . That's a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identical twin 40 years my junior. 

         To some, the scientist laboring away to unlock the mysteries of life is a source of evil, never to be trusted. To others, including me, the scientist is the ray of light, illuminating the processes that make the universe work and making us better through that knowledge. Various arguments can be advanced toward either view, but one key statistic is squarely on my side. The vast majority of people, including those who rail against science, owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries. They embody the fruits of science. Don't let the forces of darkness, ignorance, and fear turn us back from research. Instead, let us raise--and yes, even clone--new generations of hapless ingrates, who can whine and rail against the discoveries of the next age.

1,"Human Clones: Why Not? 

         If you can clone a sheep, you can almost certainly clone a human being. Some of the most powerful people in the world have felt compelled to act against this threat. President Clinton swiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for human-cloning research. Bills are in the works in both houses of Congress to outlaw human cloning--a step urged on all governments by the pope himself. Cloning humans is taken to be either 1) a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or, at the very least, 2) a complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation. But what, exactly, is so bad about it? 

         Start by asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce. I say ""yes."" I have no moral right to tell other people they shouldn't be able to have children, and I don't see that Bill Clinton has that right either. When Clinton says, ""Let us resist the temptation to copy ourselves,"" it comes from a man not known for resisting other temptations of the flesh. And for a politician, making noise about cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself. It's an easy way to show sound-bite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking about, without much risk of bitter consequences. After all, how much federally funded research was stopped by this ban? Probably almost none, because Clinton has maintained Ronald Reagan's policy of minimizing federal grants for research in human reproduction. Besides, most researchers thought cloning humans was impossible--so, for the moment, there's unlikely to be a grant-request backlog. There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership. 

         The pope, unlike the president, is known for resisting temptation. He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduce. I respect the pope's freedom to lead his religion, and his followers' freedom to follow his dictate. But calling for secular governments to implement a ban, thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade, shows rather explicitly that the pope does not respect the freedom of others. The basic religious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago. Sheep feature prominently in the Bible, but cloning does not. So the pope's views on cloning are 1 st century rules applied using 15 th century religious thinking to a 21 st century issue.

2,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed.

2,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.)

Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.) 

         Mehta's writerly persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late '70s (plagiarism, frozen turbot), the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor, the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse (""We all took fright"") and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: Tinaji. 

          Lillian Ross, by contrast, takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation. Indeed, the new editor even coaxed Ross into re-joining the magazine, just as she was booting Mehta out. ""I found that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of Bill's kind of naivete, insight, and sensitivity,"" Ross says of Brown. ""She, too, 'got it.' "" A few months after Brown was appointed editor, Shawn died at the age of 85. He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine, in sorrow and relief. That's if you believe Mehta. Ross assures us that Mr. Shawn was reading Tina Brown's New Yorker ""with new interest"" in the weeks prior to his death. 

         Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn, as Mehta fiercely believes, or has she continued and built upon it, as Ross is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this.

2,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada.

3,"Human Clones: Why Not? 

         If you can clone a sheep, you can almost certainly clone a human being. Some of the most powerful people in the world have felt compelled to act against this threat. President Clinton swiftly imposed a ban on federal funding for human-cloning research. Bills are in the works in both houses of Congress to outlaw human cloning--a step urged on all governments by the pope himself. Cloning humans is taken to be either 1) a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or, at the very least, 2) a complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation. But what, exactly, is so bad about it? 

         Start by asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce. I say ""yes."" I have no moral right to tell other people they shouldn't be able to have children, and I don't see that Bill Clinton has that right either. When Clinton says, ""Let us resist the temptation to copy ourselves,"" it comes from a man not known for resisting other temptations of the flesh. And for a politician, making noise about cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself. It's an easy way to show sound-bite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking about, without much risk of bitter consequences. After all, how much federally funded research was stopped by this ban? Probably almost none, because Clinton has maintained Ronald Reagan's policy of minimizing federal grants for research in human reproduction. Besides, most researchers thought cloning humans was impossible--so, for the moment, there's unlikely to be a grant-request backlog. There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership. 

         The pope, unlike the president, is known for resisting temptation. He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduce. I respect the pope's freedom to lead his religion, and his followers' freedom to follow his dictate. But calling for secular governments to implement a ban, thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade, shows rather explicitly that the pope does not respect the freedom of others. The basic religious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago. Sheep feature prominently in the Bible, but cloning does not. So the pope's views on cloning are 1 st century rules applied using 15 th century religious thinking to a 21 st century issue. 

         If humans have a right to reproduce, what right does society have to limit the means? Essentially all reproduction is done these days with medical help--at delivery, and often before. Truly natural human reproduction would mean 50 percent infant mortality and make pregnancy-related death the No. 1 killer of adult women. 

         True, some forms of medical help are more invasive than others. With in vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combined in the lab and surgically implanted in the womb. Less than two decades ago, a similar concern was raised over the ethical issues involved in ""test-tube babies."" To date, nearly 30,000 such babies have been born in the United States alone. Many would-be parents have been made happy. Who has been harmed? 

          The cloning procedure is similar to IVF. The only difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA from an adult cell. What law or principle--secular, humanist, or religious--says that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK, but another is not? No matter how closely you study the 1 st century texts, I don't think you'll find the answer. 

         Even if people have the right to do it, is cloning a good idea? Suppose that every prospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally, and instead produced clones of themselves. What would the world be like in another 20 or 30 years? The answer is: much like today. Cloning would only copy the genetic aspects of people who are already here. Hating a world of clones is hating the current populace. Never before was Pogo so right: We have met the enemy, and he is us ! 

         Adifferent scare scenario is a world filled with copies of famous people only. We'll treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes, hankering for Michael Jordan's genes the way we covet his Nike sneakers today. But even celebrity infatuation has its limits. People are not more taken with celebrities than they are with themselves. Besides, such a trend would correct itself in a generation or two, because celebrity is closely linked to rarity. The world seems amused by one Howard Stern, but give us a hundred or a million of them, and they'll seem a lot less endearing. 

         Clones already exist. About one in every 1,000 births results in a pair of babies with the same DNA. We know them as identical twins. Scientific studies on such twins--reared together or apart--show that they share many characteristics. Just how many they share is a contentious topic in human biology. But genetic determinism is largely irrelevant to the cloning issue. Despite how many or how few individual characteristics twins--or other clones--have in common, they are different people in the most fundamental sense . They have their own identities, their own thoughts, and their own rights. Should you be confused on this point, just ask a twin. 

         Suppose that Unsolved Mysteries called you with news of a long-lost identical twin. Would that suddenly make you less of a person, less of an individual? It is hard to see how. So, why would a clone be different? Your clone would be raised in a different era by different people--like the lost identical twin, only younger than you. A person's basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into this world, or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA. 

         Twins aren't the only clones in everyday life. Think about seedless grapes or navel oranges--if there are no seeds, where did they come from? It's the plant equivalent of virgin birth--which is to say that they are all clones, propagated by cutting a shoot and planting it. Wine is almost entirely a cloned product. The grapes used for wine have seeds, but they've been cloned from shoots for more than a hundred years in the case of many vineyards. The same is true for many flowers. Go to a garden store, and you'll find products with delightful names like ""Olivia's Cloning Compound,"" a mix of hormones to dunk on the cut end of a shoot to help it take root. 

          One recurring image in anti-cloning propaganda is of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors. Excuse me, but who is going to raise such an army (""raise"" in the sense used by parents)? Clones start out life as babies . Armies are far easier to raise the old fashioned way--by recruiting or drafting naive young adults. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young men to their deaths through the ages. Why mess with success? 

         Remember that cloning is not the same as genetic engineering. We don't get to make superman--we have to find him first. Maybe we could clone the superwarrior from Congressional Medal of Honor winners. Their bravery might--or might not--be genetically determined. But, suppose that it is. You might end up with such a brave battalion of heroes that when a grenade lands in their midst, there is a competition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others. Admirable perhaps, but not necessarily the way to win a war. And what about the supply sergeants? The army has a lot more of them than heroes. You could try to breed an expert for every job, including the petty bureaucrats, but what's the point? There's not exactly a shortage of them. 

         What if Saddam Hussein clones were to rule Iraq for another thousand years? Sounds bad, but Saddam's natural son Uday is reputed to make his father seem saintly by comparison. We have no more to fear from a clone of Saddam, or of Hitler, than we do from their natural-born kin--which is to say, we don't have much to fear: Dictators' kids rarely pose a problem. Stalin's daughter retired to Arizona, and Kim Jong Il of North Korea is laughable as Great Leader, Version 2.0. 

         The notion of an 80-year-old man cloning himself to cheat death is quaint, but it is unrealistic. First, the baby wouldn't really be him. Second, is the old duffer really up to changing diapers? A persistent octogenarian might convince a younger couple to have his clone and raise it, but that is not much different from fathering a child via a surrogate mother. 

          Fear of clones is just another form of racism. We all agree it is wrong to discriminate against people based on a set of genetic characteristics known as ""race."" Calls for a ban on cloning amount to discrimination against people based on another genetic trait--the fact that somebody already has an identical DNA sequence. The most extreme form of discrimination is genocide--seeking to eliminate that which is different. In this case, the genocide is pre-emptive--clones are so scary that we must eliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation. 

         What is so special about natural reproduction anyway? Cloning is the only predictable way to reproduce, because it creates the identical twin of a known adult. Sexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparison--some random mix of mom and dad. In evolutionary theory, this combination is thought to help stir the gene pool, so to speak. However, evolution for humans is essentially over, because we use medical science to control the death rate. 

         Whatever the temptations of cloning, the process of natural reproduction will always remain a lot more fun. An expensive and uncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex. The people most likely to clone will be those in special circumstances--infertile couples who must endure IVF anyway, for example. Even there, many will mix genetics to mimic nature. Another special case is where one member of a couple has a severe genetic disease. They might choose a clone of the healthy parent, rather than burden their child with a joint heritage that could be fatal. 

         The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn't superwarriors or dictators. It's that rich people with big egos will clone themselves. The common practice of giving a boy the same name as his father or choosing a family name for a child of either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality. Clones may resonate with this instinct and cause some people to reproduce this way. So what? Rich and egotistic folks do all sorts of annoying things, and the law is hardly the means with which to try and stop them. 

          The ""deep ethical issues"" about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy. Economic jealousy is bad enough, and it is a factor here, but the thing that truly drives people crazy is sexual jealousy. Eons of evolution through sexual selection have made the average man or woman insanely jealous of any interloper who gains a reproductive advantage--say by diddling your spouse. Cloning is less personal than cuckoldry, but it strikes a similar chord: Someone has got the reproductive edge on you. 

         Once the fuss has died down and further animal research has paved the way, direct human cloning will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions in human reproduction, affecting only a tiny fraction of the population. Research into this area could bring far wider benefits. Clinton's knee-jerk policy changes nothing in the short run, but it is ultimately a giant step backward. In using an adult cell to create a clone, the ""cellular clock"" that determines the difference between an embryo and adult was somehow reset. Work in this area might help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to reset the clocks in some of our own cells, allowing us to regenerate. Selfishly speaking, that would be more exciting to me than cloning, because it would help me . That's a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identical twin 40 years my junior. 

         To some, the scientist laboring away to unlock the mysteries of life is a source of evil, never to be trusted. To others, including me, the scientist is the ray of light, illuminating the processes that make the universe work and making us better through that knowledge. Various arguments can be advanced toward either view, but one key statistic is squarely on my side. The vast majority of people, including those who rail against science, owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries. They embody the fruits of science. Don't let the forces of darkness, ignorance, and fear turn us back from research. Instead, let us raise--and yes, even clone--new generations of hapless ingrates, who can whine and rail against the discoveries of the next age.

Cloning humans is taken to be either 1) a fundamentally evil thing that must be stopped or, at the very least, 2) a complex ethical issue that needs legislation and regulation. But what, exactly, is so bad about it? 

         Start by asking whether human beings have a right to reproduce. I say ""yes."" I have no moral right to tell other people they shouldn't be able to have children, and I don't see that Bill Clinton has that right either. When Clinton says, ""Let us resist the temptation to copy ourselves,"" it comes from a man not known for resisting other temptations of the flesh. And for a politician, making noise about cloning is pretty close to a fleshly temptation itself. It's an easy way to show sound-bite leadership on an issue that everybody is talking about, without much risk of bitter consequences. After all, how much federally funded research was stopped by this ban? Probably almost none, because Clinton has maintained Ronald Reagan's policy of minimizing federal grants for research in human reproduction. Besides, most researchers thought cloning humans was impossible--so, for the moment, there's unlikely to be a grant-request backlog. There is nothing like banning the nonexistent to show true leadership. 

         The pope, unlike the president, is known for resisting temptation. He also openly claims the authority to decide how people reproduce. I respect the pope's freedom to lead his religion, and his followers' freedom to follow his dictate. But calling for secular governments to implement a ban, thus extending his power beyond those he can persuade, shows rather explicitly that the pope does not respect the freedom of others. The basic religious doctrine he follows was set down some two millennia ago. Sheep feature prominently in the Bible, but cloning does not. So the pope's views on cloning are 1 st century rules applied using 15 th century religious thinking to a 21 st century issue. 

         If humans have a right to reproduce, what right does society have to limit the means? Essentially all reproduction is done these days with medical help--at delivery, and often before. Truly natural human reproduction would mean 50 percent infant mortality and make pregnancy-related death the No. 1 killer of adult women. 

         True, some forms of medical help are more invasive than others. With in vitro fertilization, the sperm and egg are combined in the lab and surgically implanted in the womb. Less than two decades ago, a similar concern was raised over the ethical issues involved in ""test-tube babies."" To date, nearly 30,000 such babies have been born in the United States alone. Many would-be parents have been made happy. Who has been harmed? 

          The cloning procedure is similar to IVF. The only difference is that the DNA of sperm and egg would be replaced by DNA from an adult cell. What law or principle--secular, humanist, or religious--says that one combination of genetic material in a flask is OK, but another is not? No matter how closely you study the 1 st century texts, I don't think you'll find the answer. 

         Even if people have the right to do it, is cloning a good idea? Suppose that every prospective parent in the world stopped having children naturally, and instead produced clones of themselves. What would the world be like in another 20 or 30 years? The answer is: much like today. Cloning would only copy the genetic aspects of people who are already here. Hating a world of clones is hating the current populace. Never before was Pogo so right: We have met the enemy, and he is us ! 

         Adifferent scare scenario is a world filled with copies of famous people only. We'll treat celebrity DNA like designer clothes, hankering for Michael Jordan's genes the way we covet his Nike sneakers today. But even celebrity infatuation has its limits. People are not more taken with celebrities than they are with themselves. Besides, such a trend would correct itself in a generation or two, because celebrity is closely linked to rarity. The world seems amused by one Howard Stern, but give us a hundred or a million of them, and they'll seem a lot less endearing. 

         Clones already exist. About one in every 1,000 births results in a pair of babies with the same DNA. We know them as identical twins. Scientific studies on such twins--reared together or apart--show that they share many characteristics. Just how many they share is a contentious topic in human biology. But genetic determinism is largely irrelevant to the cloning issue. Despite how many or how few individual characteristics twins--or other clones--have in common, they are different people in the most fundamental sense . They have their own identities, their own thoughts, and their own rights. Should you be confused on this point, just ask a twin. 

         Suppose that Unsolved Mysteries called you with news of a long-lost identical twin. Would that suddenly make you less of a person, less of an individual? It is hard to see how. So, why would a clone be different? Your clone would be raised in a different era by different people--like the lost identical twin, only younger than you. A person's basic humanity is not governed by how he or she came into this world, or whether somebody else happens to have the same DNA. 

         Twins aren't the only clones in everyday life. Think about seedless grapes or navel oranges--if there are no seeds, where did they come from? It's the plant equivalent of virgin birth--which is to say that they are all clones, propagated by cutting a shoot and planting it. Wine is almost entirely a cloned product. The grapes used for wine have seeds, but they've been cloned from shoots for more than a hundred years in the case of many vineyards. The same is true for many flowers. Go to a garden store, and you'll find products with delightful names like ""Olivia's Cloning Compound,"" a mix of hormones to dunk on the cut end of a shoot to help it take root. 

          One recurring image in anti-cloning propaganda is of some evil dictator raising an army of cloned warriors. Excuse me, but who is going to raise such an army (""raise"" in the sense used by parents)? Clones start out life as babies . Armies are far easier to raise the old fashioned way--by recruiting or drafting naive young adults. Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori has worked well enough to send countless young men to their deaths through the ages. Why mess with success? 

         Remember that cloning is not the same as genetic engineering. We don't get to make superman--we have to find him first. Maybe we could clone the superwarrior from Congressional Medal of Honor winners. Their bravery might--or might not--be genetically determined. But, suppose that it is. You might end up with such a brave battalion of heroes that when a grenade lands in their midst, there is a competition to see who gets to jump on it to save the others. Admirable perhaps, but not necessarily the way to win a war. And what about the supply sergeants? The army has a lot more of them than heroes. You could try to breed an expert for every job, including the petty bureaucrats, but what's the point? There's not exactly a shortage of them. 

         What if Saddam Hussein clones were to rule Iraq for another thousand years? Sounds bad, but Saddam's natural son Uday is reputed to make his father seem saintly by comparison. We have no more to fear from a clone of Saddam, or of Hitler, than we do from their natural-born kin--which is to say, we don't have much to fear: Dictators' kids rarely pose a problem. Stalin's daughter retired to Arizona, and Kim Jong Il of North Korea is laughable as Great Leader, Version 2.0. 

         The notion of an 80-year-old man cloning himself to cheat death is quaint, but it is unrealistic. First, the baby wouldn't really be him. Second, is the old duffer really up to changing diapers? A persistent octogenarian might convince a younger couple to have his clone and raise it, but that is not much different from fathering a child via a surrogate mother. 

          Fear of clones is just another form of racism. We all agree it is wrong to discriminate against people based on a set of genetic characteristics known as ""race."" Calls for a ban on cloning amount to discrimination against people based on another genetic trait--the fact that somebody already has an identical DNA sequence. The most extreme form of discrimination is genocide--seeking to eliminate that which is different. In this case, the genocide is pre-emptive--clones are so scary that we must eliminate them before they exist with a ban on their creation. 

         What is so special about natural reproduction anyway? Cloning is the only predictable way to reproduce, because it creates the identical twin of a known adult. Sexual reproduction is a crap shoot by comparison--some random mix of mom and dad. In evolutionary theory, this combination is thought to help stir the gene pool, so to speak. However, evolution for humans is essentially over, because we use medical science to control the death rate. 

         Whatever the temptations of cloning, the process of natural reproduction will always remain a lot more fun. An expensive and uncomfortable lab procedure will never offer any real competition for sex. The people most likely to clone will be those in special circumstances--infertile couples who must endure IVF anyway, for example. Even there, many will mix genetics to mimic nature. Another special case is where one member of a couple has a severe genetic disease. They might choose a clone of the healthy parent, rather than burden their child with a joint heritage that could be fatal. 

         The most upsetting possibility in human cloning isn't superwarriors or dictators. It's that rich people with big egos will clone themselves. The common practice of giving a boy the same name as his father or choosing a family name for a child of either sex reflects our hunger for vicarious immortality. Clones may resonate with this instinct and cause some people to reproduce this way. So what? Rich and egotistic folks do all sorts of annoying things, and the law is hardly the means with which to try and stop them. 

          The ""deep ethical issues"" about cloning mainly boil down to jealousy. Economic jealousy is bad enough, and it is a factor here, but the thing that truly drives people crazy is sexual jealousy. Eons of evolution through sexual selection have made the average man or woman insanely jealous of any interloper who gains a reproductive advantage--say by diddling your spouse. Cloning is less personal than cuckoldry, but it strikes a similar chord: Someone has got the reproductive edge on you. 

         Once the fuss has died down and further animal research has paved the way, direct human cloning will be one more option among many specialized medical interventions in human reproduction, affecting only a tiny fraction of the population. Research into this area could bring far wider benefits. Clinton's knee-jerk policy changes nothing in the short run, but it is ultimately a giant step backward. In using an adult cell to create a clone, the ""cellular clock"" that determines the difference between an embryo and adult was somehow reset. Work in this area might help elucidate the process by which aging occurs and yield a way to reset the clocks in some of our own cells, allowing us to regenerate. Selfishly speaking, that would be more exciting to me than cloning, because it would help me . That's a lot more directly useful than letting me sire an identical twin 40 years my junior. 

         To some, the scientist laboring away to unlock the mysteries of life is a source of evil, never to be trusted. To others, including me, the scientist is the ray of light, illuminating the processes that make the universe work and making us better through that knowledge. Various arguments can be advanced toward either view, but one key statistic is squarely on my side. The vast majority of people, including those who rail against science, owe their very lives to previous medical discoveries. They embody the fruits of science. Don't let the forces of darkness, ignorance, and fear turn us back from research. Instead, let us raise--and yes, even clone--new generations of hapless ingrates, who can whine and rail against the discoveries of the next age.

4,"The Bell Curve Flattened 

         Charles Murray is a publicity genius, and the publication of his and Richard Herrnstein's book, The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , in the fall of 1994 was his masterpiece. 

         Virtually all ambitious trade hardcover books are preceded by an edition of 100 to 200 flimsy ""galley proofs."" These are sent out to people who might generate buzz for the book: blurbists, bookers for television talk shows, editors, and--most important--book critics. There is an ethos of letting the chips fall where they may about the sending out of galleys: Now the book will begin to receive uncontrolled reaction. (For example, back in 1991, Murray somehow got hold of the galleys of my own last book, and wrote me heatedly denying that he was working on a book about black genetic intellectual inferiority, as I had asserted. I left the passage in, but softened it.) 

         The Bell Curve was not circulated in galleys before publication. The effect was, first, to increase the allure of the book (There must be something really hot in there!), and second, to ensure that no one inclined to be skeptical would be able to weigh in at the moment of publication. The people who had galley proofs were handpicked by Murray and his publisher. The ordinary routine of neutral reviewers having a month or two to go over the book with care did not occur. Another handpicked group was flown to Washington at the expense of the American Enterprise Institute and given a weekend-long personal briefing on the book's contents by Murray himself (Herrnstein had died very recently), just before publication. The result was what you'd expect: The first wave of publicity was either credulous or angry, but short on evidence, because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate the book carefully. 

                         The Bell Curve isn't a typical work of trade nonfiction. It is gotten up as a work of original scholarly research. Most works containing fresh regression analysis and historical argument from primary sources would be published in academic quarterlies that send manuscripts out for elaborate, lengthy evaluation before deciding whether to publish them. Herrnstein and Murray didn't do this, so it wasn't until a full year or more after The Bell Curve was published that the leading experts on its subject had a chance to go through the underlying data with care. Therefore, as time went on, the knowledgeability of the Bell Curve discussion grew, but the attention paid to that discussion inevitably shrank. 

         The debate on publication day was conducted in the mass media by people with no independent ability to assess the book. Over the next few months, intellectuals took some pretty good shots at it in smaller publications like the New Republic and the New York Review of Books . It wasn't until late 1995 that the most damaging criticism of The Bell Curve began to appear, in tiny academic journals. What follows is a brief summary of that last body of work. The Bell Curve , it turns out, is full of mistakes ranging from sloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors. Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting the authors' thesis. 

          First, a quick prÃ©cis of The Bell Curve . IQ tests, according to Murray and Herrnstein, measure an essential human quality, general intelligence. During the second half of the 20 th century, this quality has risen to supreme importance, because society has become increasingly complex. The intelligent have therefore gone through an ""invisible migration,"" from points of origin all over the class system to a concentration at the top of business, government, and the professions. They are likely to become ever more dominant and prosperous. The unintelligent are falling further and further behind. Because intelligence is substantially inherited, nothing is likely to reverse this process. Blacks are overrepresented among the unintelligent. Any efforts government might make to improve the economic opportunities of poor people, especially poor black people, are likely to fail, because their poverty is so much the result of inherited low intelligence. About the best that can be done for these people is an effort to create a world of simple, decent, honorable toil for them. 

          Herrnstein and Murray begin by telling us that the liberal position on IQ--namely, ""Intelligence is a bankrupt concept""--has been discredited, and that ""a scholarly consensus has been reached"" around their position. This consensus is ""beyond significant technical dispute."" Thus, by the end of their introduction, they have arranged matters so that if intelligence has any meaning at all, the idiotic liberals stand discredited; and meanwhile, extremely broad claims for intelligence have the cover of ""consensus."" 

         The notion that IQ tests are completely useless never prevailed in liberal academia to nearly the extent that Herrnstein and Murray say. A more accurate rendering of the liberal position would be that rather than a single ""general intelligence,"" there are a handful of crucial--and separate--mental abilities; that none of these abilities is important enough to obviate the role of family background and education; and that native ability (and economic success independent of native ability) can be enhanced by improving education, training, and public health. The Bell Curve refers in passing to some of these points, but on the whole it sets up a cartoon-left position as its (easy) target. Meanwhile, the psychometricians who dominate the footnotes of The Bell Curve are John Hunter, Arthur Jensen, Malcolm Ree, and Frank Schmidt. These men are well known within the field as representing its right wing, not a mainstream consensus. 

         The next problem with The Bell Curve 's thesis is in the idea of the rise to dominance of the cognitive elite. To the book's initial audience of Ivy Leaguers, this idea seemed valid on its face. Everybody knows that the best universities, law firms, hospitals, investment banks, and the State Department used to be run by preppies whose main virtue was fortunate birth, and are now open to one and all on the basis of merit. 

          But the larger premise--that intelligent people used to be scattered throughout the class structure, and are now concentrated at the top--is almost impossible to prove, simply because the mass administration of mental tests is such a recent phenomenon. High scorers on mental tests do ""bunch up"" (as Herrnstein and Murray put it) in elite-university student bodies. But this is tautological: Any group selected on the basis of scores on mental tests will be composed disproportionately of people who score high on mental tests. Proving The Bell Curve 's thesis would require proving that success increasingly correlates with IQ in areas of life where mental tests are not the explicit gatekeepers. To see how The Bell Curve tries and fails to get around these inherent problems, see and . 

         Having conditioned its audience to view IQ as all-important, The Bell Curve then manipulates statistics in a way that makes IQ look bigger, and everything else smaller, in determining Americans' life-chances. 

         The basic tool of statistical social science in general, and of The Bell Curve in particular, is regression analysis, a technique used to assign weights to various factors (called ""independent variables"") in determining a final outcome (called the ""dependent variable""). The original statistical work in The Bell Curve consists of regression analyses on a database called the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The authors claim to demonstrate that high IQ is more predictive of economic success than any other factor, and that low IQ is more predictive of poverty and social breakdown. Virtually all the early commentators on The Bell Curve were unable to assess the merits of the regression analysis. ""I am not a scientist. I know nothing about psychometrics,"" wrote Leon Wieseltier (who was otherwise quite critical) in a typical disclaimer. 

         But by now the statistics have been gone over by professionals, who have come up with different results. The key points of their critique of The Bell Curve are as follows: 

         What Herrnstein and Murray used to measure IQ is actually a measure of education as well as intelligence. All the people tracked in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth took the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, which Herrnstein and Murray treat as a good measure of intelligence. Because the material covered in the test includes subjects like trigonometry, many academic critics of The Bell Curve have objected to its use as a measure only of IQ and not at all of academic achievement. Herrnstein and Murray concede in the footnotes that scores tend to rise with the subjects' education--but they seriously underestimate the magnitude of this rise, as shows. And they resist the obvious inference that the test scores are measuring something other than intelligence. 

         Most of The Bell Curve 's analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive power than parental ""socio-economic status."" But Herrnstein and Murray's method of figuring socioeconomic status seems designed to low-ball its influence, as explains. 

         Herrnstein and Murray begin their discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcing that they aren't going to analyze the effect of education, because education is too much a result of IQ. It's not an independent variable. (Of course, according to their theory, socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ, but somehow, that doesn't stop them.) Therefore, what you'd most want to know from a policy standpoint--how much education can increase opportunity--isn't dealt with in the book, except in two obscure footnotes. Both would seem to support the liberal, pro-education position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futile. One footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year. The other shows a higher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ and family income. 

         One of The Bell Curve 's theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ. Herrnstein and Murray, sounding like the souls of caution, write that ""half a century of work, now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies, permits a broad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smaller than 40 per cent or higher than 80 per cent. ... For purposes of this discussion, we will adopt a middling estimate of 60 per cent heritability."" This now looks seriously overstated. Michael Daniels, Bernie Devlin, and Kathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on which Herrnstein and Murray based their estimate, and subjected them to a computer meta-analysis (""a powerful method of statistical analysis""-- The Bell Curve ). Their paper, which has not yet been published, says: ""In brief, studies of IQ, and our reanalyses of them, suggest a narrow-sense heritability of 34 per cent and a broad-sense heritability of 46 per cent. [The difference between broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited space.] This is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murray's maximum value of 80 per cent or their middling value of 60 per cent. Consequently, Herrnstein and Murray give the impression that IQ is highly 'heritable,' but it is not."" 

         If the purpose of the whole exercise is to figure out what our social policies should be, then, ""Which is more predictive, IQ or socioeconomic status?"" isn't the essential question anyway. Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ is really so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else. (Herrnstein and Murray mostly leave the evidence for this, their central contention, to footnotes. The figures they offer are far from dispositive.) 

         The chapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome the fate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether early-childhood programs like Head Start (most of which aren't run with raising IQ as their primary goal) can raise IQ significantly over the long term, and sorrowfully concludes that they can't. What the book doesn't discuss is whether public schools--by far the biggest government social program--can raise IQ, or earnings after you control for IQ. As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journal of Political Economy , "" Evidence of a genetic component to skills has no bearing on the efficacy of any social policy. ... The relevant issue is the cost effectiveness of the intervention."" (As an example of where the kind of analysis Herrnstein and Murray didn't do can lead, a new study by Jay Girotto and Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades and take harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight points during the first three years of high school.) 

          At the beginning of The Bell Curve , Herrnstein and Murray declare that ""the concept of intelligence has taken on a much higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves."" And they claim that their view of IQ tests is ""squarely in the middle of the scientific road."" They end by expressing the hope that we can ""be a society that makes good on the fundamental promise of the American tradition: the opportunity for everyone, not just the lucky ones, to live a satisfying life."" Throughout, Herrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair- (or even liberal-) minded technicians who have, with great caution, followed the evidence where it leads--which, unfortunately, is to a few unassailable if unpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report. 

         In fact, The Bell Curve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometrics and social policy. For all its talk of reflecting a consensus, the sources it draws upon are heavily skewed to the right. Herrnstein and Murray used quasi-nutty studies that support their position (as Charles Lane demonstrated in the New York Review of Books ), and ignore mainstream studies that contradict it (as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic ). The data in The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservative conclusions; not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported in the text. ( shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence in black-white IQ scores, which they claim to find ""encouraging,"" look smaller than it actually is.) The Bell Curve 's air of strict scientism doesn't preclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions, such as the statement that the median IQ of all black Africans is 75, or that ""intermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may be increasing far more rapidly than suspected"" (no footnote). Though they piously claim not to be doing so, Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinct impression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure, and that genetic difference explains the black-white IQ gap. 

         In the most famous passage in The Republic , Plato describes an underground cave where people are held prisoner in chains, unable to see anything but the shadows cast by figures passing outside; they mistake the shadows for reality. The Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea like that of Murray and Herrnstein's cognitive elite appears. Plato believed that through education, people could leave the cave and be able to see the truth instead of the shadows, thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers of society. But he was quick to insert a cautionary note: Those who have left the cave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly, while actually they would be ""dazzled by excess of light."" The image applies to The Bell Curve : Presented as an exact representation of reality, in opposition to the shadows of political correctness, it actually reflects the blinkered vision of one part of the American elite. It constantly tells these people that they are naturally superior, and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of national life that they know about only by rumor. Readers who accept The Bell Curve as tough-minded and realistic, and who assume that all criticism of it is ignorant and ideologically motivated, are not as far removed from Plato's cave as they might think.

          But the larger premise--that intelligent people used to be scattered throughout the class structure, and are now concentrated at the top--is almost impossible to prove, simply because the mass administration of mental tests is such a recent phenomenon. High scorers on mental tests do ""bunch up"" (as Herrnstein and Murray put it) in elite-university student bodies. But this is tautological: Any group selected on the basis of scores on mental tests will be composed disproportionately of people who score high on mental tests. Proving The Bell Curve 's thesis would require proving that success increasingly correlates with IQ in areas of life where mental tests are not the explicit gatekeepers. To see how The Bell Curve tries and fails to get around these inherent problems, see and . 

         Having conditioned its audience to view IQ as all-important, The Bell Curve then manipulates statistics in a way that makes IQ look bigger, and everything else smaller, in determining Americans' life-chances. 

         The basic tool of statistical social science in general, and of The Bell Curve in particular, is regression analysis, a technique used to assign weights to various factors (called ""independent variables"") in determining a final outcome (called the ""dependent variable""). The original statistical work in The Bell Curve consists of regression analyses on a database called the National Longitudinal Study of Youth. The authors claim to demonstrate that high IQ is more predictive of economic success than any other factor, and that low IQ is more predictive of poverty and social breakdown. Virtually all the early commentators on The Bell Curve were unable to assess the merits of the regression analysis. ""I am not a scientist. I know nothing about psychometrics,"" wrote Leon Wieseltier (who was otherwise quite critical) in a typical disclaimer. 

         But by now the statistics have been gone over by professionals, who have come up with different results. The key points of their critique of The Bell Curve are as follows: 

         What Herrnstein and Murray used to measure IQ is actually a measure of education as well as intelligence. All the people tracked in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth took the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, which Herrnstein and Murray treat as a good measure of intelligence. Because the material covered in the test includes subjects like trigonometry, many academic critics of The Bell Curve have objected to its use as a measure only of IQ and not at all of academic achievement. Herrnstein and Murray concede in the footnotes that scores tend to rise with the subjects' education--but they seriously underestimate the magnitude of this rise, as shows. And they resist the obvious inference that the test scores are measuring something other than intelligence. 

         Most of The Bell Curve 's analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive power than parental ""socio-economic status."" But Herrnstein and Murray's method of figuring socioeconomic status seems designed to low-ball its influence, as explains. 

         Herrnstein and Murray begin their discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcing that they aren't going to analyze the effect of education, because education is too much a result of IQ. It's not an independent variable. (Of course, according to their theory, socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ, but somehow, that doesn't stop them.) Therefore, what you'd most want to know from a policy standpoint--how much education can increase opportunity--isn't dealt with in the book, except in two obscure footnotes. Both would seem to support the liberal, pro-education position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futile. One footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year. The other shows a higher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ and family income. 

         One of The Bell Curve 's theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ. Herrnstein and Murray, sounding like the souls of caution, write that ""half a century of work, now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies, permits a broad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smaller than 40 per cent or higher than 80 per cent. ... For purposes of this discussion, we will adopt a middling estimate of 60 per cent heritability."" This now looks seriously overstated. Michael Daniels, Bernie Devlin, and Kathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on which Herrnstein and Murray based their estimate, and subjected them to a computer meta-analysis (""a powerful method of statistical analysis""-- The Bell Curve ). Their paper, which has not yet been published, says: ""In brief, studies of IQ, and our reanalyses of them, suggest a narrow-sense heritability of 34 per cent and a broad-sense heritability of 46 per cent. [The difference between broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited space.] This is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murray's maximum value of 80 per cent or their middling value of 60 per cent. Consequently, Herrnstein and Murray give the impression that IQ is highly 'heritable,' but it is not."" 

         If the purpose of the whole exercise is to figure out what our social policies should be, then, ""Which is more predictive, IQ or socioeconomic status?"" isn't the essential question anyway. Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ is really so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else. (Herrnstein and Murray mostly leave the evidence for this, their central contention, to footnotes. The figures they offer are far from dispositive.) 

         The chapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome the fate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether early-childhood programs like Head Start (most of which aren't run with raising IQ as their primary goal) can raise IQ significantly over the long term, and sorrowfully concludes that they can't. What the book doesn't discuss is whether public schools--by far the biggest government social program--can raise IQ, or earnings after you control for IQ. As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journal of Political Economy , "" Evidence of a genetic component to skills has no bearing on the efficacy of any social policy. ... The relevant issue is the cost effectiveness of the intervention."" (As an example of where the kind of analysis Herrnstein and Murray didn't do can lead, a new study by Jay Girotto and Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades and take harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight points during the first three years of high school.) 

          At the beginning of The Bell Curve , Herrnstein and Murray declare that ""the concept of intelligence has taken on a much higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves."" And they claim that their view of IQ tests is ""squarely in the middle of the scientific road."" They end by expressing the hope that we can ""be a society that makes good on the fundamental promise of the American tradition: the opportunity for everyone, not just the lucky ones, to live a satisfying life."" Throughout, Herrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair- (or even liberal-) minded technicians who have, with great caution, followed the evidence where it leads--which, unfortunately, is to a few unassailable if unpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report. 

         In fact, The Bell Curve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometrics and social policy. For all its talk of reflecting a consensus, the sources it draws upon are heavily skewed to the right. Herrnstein and Murray used quasi-nutty studies that support their position (as Charles Lane demonstrated in the New York Review of Books ), and ignore mainstream studies that contradict it (as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic ). The data in The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservative conclusions; not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported in the text. ( shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence in black-white IQ scores, which they claim to find ""encouraging,"" look smaller than it actually is.) The Bell Curve 's air of strict scientism doesn't preclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions, such as the statement that the median IQ of all black Africans is 75, or that ""intermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may be increasing far more rapidly than suspected"" (no footnote). Though they piously claim not to be doing so, Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinct impression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure, and that genetic difference explains the black-white IQ gap. 

         In the most famous passage in The Republic , Plato describes an underground cave where people are held prisoner in chains, unable to see anything but the shadows cast by figures passing outside; they mistake the shadows for reality. The Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea like that of Murray and Herrnstein's cognitive elite appears. Plato believed that through education, people could leave the cave and be able to see the truth instead of the shadows, thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers of society. But he was quick to insert a cautionary note: Those who have left the cave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly, while actually they would be ""dazzled by excess of light."" The image applies to The Bell Curve : Presented as an exact representation of reality, in opposition to the shadows of political correctness, it actually reflects the blinkered vision of one part of the American elite. It constantly tells these people that they are naturally superior, and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of national life that they know about only by rumor. Readers who accept The Bell Curve as tough-minded and realistic, and who assume that all criticism of it is ignorant and ideologically motivated, are not as far removed from Plato's cave as they might think.

         Charles Murray is a publicity genius, and the publication of his and Richard Herrnstein's book, The Bell Curve: Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life , in the fall of 1994 was his masterpiece. 

         Virtually all ambitious trade hardcover books are preceded by an edition of 100 to 200 flimsy ""galley proofs."" These are sent out to people who might generate buzz for the book: blurbists, bookers for television talk shows, editors, and--most important--book critics. There is an ethos of letting the chips fall where they may about the sending out of galleys: Now the book will begin to receive uncontrolled reaction. (For example, back in 1991, Murray somehow got hold of the galleys of my own last book, and wrote me heatedly denying that he was working on a book about black genetic intellectual inferiority, as I had asserted. I left the passage in, but softened it.) 

         The Bell Curve was not circulated in galleys before publication. The effect was, first, to increase the allure of the book (There must be something really hot in there!), and second, to ensure that no one inclined to be skeptical would be able to weigh in at the moment of publication. The people who had galley proofs were handpicked by Murray and his publisher. The ordinary routine of neutral reviewers having a month or two to go over the book with care did not occur. Another handpicked group was flown to Washington at the expense of the American Enterprise Institute and given a weekend-long personal briefing on the book's contents by Murray himself (Herrnstein had died very recently), just before publication. The result was what you'd expect: The first wave of publicity was either credulous or angry, but short on evidence, because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate the book carefully. 

                         The Bell Curve isn't a typical work of trade nonfiction. It is gotten up as a work of original scholarly research. Most works containing fresh regression analysis and historical argument from primary sources would be published in academic quarterlies that send manuscripts out for elaborate, lengthy evaluation before deciding whether to publish them. Herrnstein and Murray didn't do this, so it wasn't until a full year or more after The Bell Curve was published that the leading experts on its subject had a chance to go through the underlying data with care. Therefore, as time went on, the knowledgeability of the Bell Curve discussion grew, but the attention paid to that discussion inevitably shrank. 

         The debate on publication day was conducted in the mass media by people with no independent ability to assess the book. Over the next few months, intellectuals took some pretty good shots at it in smaller publications like the New Republic and the New York Review of Books . It wasn't until late 1995 that the most damaging criticism of The Bell Curve began to appear, in tiny academic journals. What follows is a brief summary of that last body of work. The Bell Curve , it turns out, is full of mistakes ranging from sloppy reasoning to mis-citations of sources to outright mathematical errors. Unsurprisingly, all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting the authors' thesis. 

          First, a quick prÃ©cis of The Bell Curve . IQ tests, according to Murray and Herrnstein, measure an essential human quality, general intelligence. During the second half of the 20 th century, this quality has risen to supreme importance, because society has become increasingly complex. The intelligent have therefore gone through an ""invisible migration,"" from points of origin all over the class system to a concentration at the top of business, government, and the professions. They are likely to become ever more dominant and prosperous. The unintelligent are falling further and further behind. Because intelligence is substantially inherited, nothing is likely to reverse this process. Blacks are overrepresented among the unintelligent. Any efforts government might make to improve the economic opportunities of poor people, especially poor black people, are likely to fail, because their poverty is so much the result of inherited low intelligence. About the best that can be done for these people is an effort to create a world of simple, decent, honorable toil for them. 

          Herrnstein and Murray begin by telling us that the liberal position on IQ--namely, ""Intelligence is a bankrupt concept""--has been discredited, and that ""a scholarly consensus has been reached"" around their position. This consensus is ""beyond significant technical dispute."" Thus, by the end of their introduction, they have arranged matters so that if intelligence has any meaning at all, the idiotic liberals stand discredited; and meanwhile, extremely broad claims for intelligence have the cover of ""consensus."" 

         The notion that IQ tests are completely useless never prevailed in liberal academia to nearly the extent that Herrnstein and Murray say. A more accurate rendering of the liberal position would be that rather than a single ""general intelligence,"" there are a handful of crucial--and separate--mental abilities; that none of these abilities is important enough to obviate the role of family background and education; and that native ability (and economic success independent of native ability) can be enhanced by improving education, training, and public health. The Bell Curve refers in passing to some of these points, but on the whole it sets up a cartoon-left position as its (easy) target. Meanwhile, the psychometricians who dominate the footnotes of The Bell Curve are John Hunter, Arthur Jensen, Malcolm Ree, and Frank Schmidt. These men are well known within the field as representing its right wing, not a mainstream consensus. 

         The next problem with The Bell Curve 's thesis is in the idea of the rise to dominance of the cognitive elite. To the book's initial audience of Ivy Leaguers, this idea seemed valid on its face. Everybody knows that the best universities, law firms, hospitals, investment banks, and the State Department used to be run by preppies whose main virtue was fortunate birth, and are now open to one and all on the basis of merit.

         Most of The Bell Curve 's analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive power than parental ""socio-economic status."" But Herrnstein and Murray's method of figuring socioeconomic status seems designed to low-ball its influence, as explains. 

         Herrnstein and Murray begin their discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcing that they aren't going to analyze the effect of education, because education is too much a result of IQ. It's not an independent variable. (Of course, according to their theory, socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ, but somehow, that doesn't stop them.) Therefore, what you'd most want to know from a policy standpoint--how much education can increase opportunity--isn't dealt with in the book, except in two obscure footnotes. Both would seem to support the liberal, pro-education position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futile. One footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year. The other shows a higher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ and family income. 

         One of The Bell Curve 's theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ. Herrnstein and Murray, sounding like the souls of caution, write that ""half a century of work, now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies, permits a broad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smaller than 40 per cent or higher than 80 per cent. ... For purposes of this discussion, we will adopt a middling estimate of 60 per cent heritability."" This now looks seriously overstated. Michael Daniels, Bernie Devlin, and Kathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on which Herrnstein and Murray based their estimate, and subjected them to a computer meta-analysis (""a powerful method of statistical analysis""-- The Bell Curve ). Their paper, which has not yet been published, says: ""In brief, studies of IQ, and our reanalyses of them, suggest a narrow-sense heritability of 34 per cent and a broad-sense heritability of 46 per cent. [The difference between broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited space.] This is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murray's maximum value of 80 per cent or their middling value of 60 per cent. Consequently, Herrnstein and Murray give the impression that IQ is highly 'heritable,' but it is not."" 

         If the purpose of the whole exercise is to figure out what our social policies should be, then, ""Which is more predictive, IQ or socioeconomic status?"" isn't the essential question anyway. Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ is really so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else. (Herrnstein and Murray mostly leave the evidence for this, their central contention, to footnotes. The figures they offer are far from dispositive.) 

         The chapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome the fate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether early-childhood programs like Head Start (most of which aren't run with raising IQ as their primary goal) can raise IQ significantly over the long term, and sorrowfully concludes that they can't. What the book doesn't discuss is whether public schools--by far the biggest government social program--can raise IQ, or earnings after you control for IQ. As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journal of Political Economy , "" Evidence of a genetic component to skills has no bearing on the efficacy of any social policy. ... The relevant issue is the cost effectiveness of the intervention."" (As an example of where the kind of analysis Herrnstein and Murray didn't do can lead, a new study by Jay Girotto and Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades and take harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight points during the first three years of high school.) 

          At the beginning of The Bell Curve , Herrnstein and Murray declare that ""the concept of intelligence has taken on a much higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves."" And they claim that their view of IQ tests is ""squarely in the middle of the scientific road."" They end by expressing the hope that we can ""be a society that makes good on the fundamental promise of the American tradition: the opportunity for everyone, not just the lucky ones, to live a satisfying life."" Throughout, Herrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair- (or even liberal-) minded technicians who have, with great caution, followed the evidence where it leads--which, unfortunately, is to a few unassailable if unpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report. 

         In fact, The Bell Curve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometrics and social policy. For all its talk of reflecting a consensus, the sources it draws upon are heavily skewed to the right. Herrnstein and Murray used quasi-nutty studies that support their position (as Charles Lane demonstrated in the New York Review of Books ), and ignore mainstream studies that contradict it (as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic ). The data in The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservative conclusions; not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported in the text. ( shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence in black-white IQ scores, which they claim to find ""encouraging,"" look smaller than it actually is.) The Bell Curve 's air of strict scientism doesn't preclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions, such as the statement that the median IQ of all black Africans is 75, or that ""intermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may be increasing far more rapidly than suspected"" (no footnote). Though they piously claim not to be doing so, Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinct impression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure, and that genetic difference explains the black-white IQ gap. 

         In the most famous passage in The Republic , Plato describes an underground cave where people are held prisoner in chains, unable to see anything but the shadows cast by figures passing outside; they mistake the shadows for reality. The Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea like that of Murray and Herrnstein's cognitive elite appears. Plato believed that through education, people could leave the cave and be able to see the truth instead of the shadows, thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers of society. But he was quick to insert a cautionary note: Those who have left the cave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly, while actually they would be ""dazzled by excess of light."" The image applies to The Bell Curve : Presented as an exact representation of reality, in opposition to the shadows of political correctness, it actually reflects the blinkered vision of one part of the American elite. It constantly tells these people that they are naturally superior, and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of national life that they know about only by rumor. Readers who accept The Bell Curve as tough-minded and realistic, and who assume that all criticism of it is ignorant and ideologically motivated, are not as far removed from Plato's cave as they might think.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.

 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the

 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their

7,"Shut Up, He Explained 

         Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss', but the wisdom is conventional. 

         Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument (though it is not quite the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of speech. 

         This is what Fiss means by the ""irony"" in his title: that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it. 

                         The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues: campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes, and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School. 

          The argument is that ""the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty."" The constitutional law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he calls it ""libertarian""--which regarded free speech as a right of individual self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves. 

         Fiss' suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to foster (in William Brennan's words) ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"" debate in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of unorthodox art. 

         The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard, which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to ""self-expression"" but the ""right to property."" Turn-of-the-century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two ""liberalisms"" are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies. 

         Hand, Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as ""the right of the donkey to drool"") but on a democratic need for full and open political debate. First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts on precisely that social value--the very value Fiss now proposes we need to insert into First Amendment jurisprudence. We don't need to insert it, because it was there from the start. 

          Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way? Because he wants to line up his own free-speech argument within the conventional academic view that our problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable ideology of liberal individualism, and that they can mostly be solved by adopting a social-constructionist, or communitarian, or ""intersubjective"" view of human nature instead. The merits of liberal individualism vs. communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated. For since the law governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism, the matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in ""self-expression"" with a more up-to-date belief in ""robust debate,"" as Fiss would like to think it does. What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the Hand-Holmes-Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a democratic society, which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as possible, with a different way, which tries to get the state farther into the picture. 

         Here, assuming we want to try the interventionist approach, it is hard to see how a one-size theory can possibly fit all cases. The issues underlying pornography, hate speech, arts grants, campaign finance, and equal-time provisions are all different. The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas, campaign finance and equal-time provisions, is related less to speech, except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old ""right to property""--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry ""opposing viewpoints"" on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like. Fiss believes that the need for equal-time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s, which is peculiar in light of the proliferation of media outlets. But the state does arguably have an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book. 

         Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other issues, rests on a claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase, that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who ""silence"" women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert Mapplethorpe. 

         Fiss' analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach. Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the ""robustness"" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.) 

          Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, ""in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community, so long hidden from view."" This seems completely wrongheaded. People (for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X                 Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism. The notion that it was what Fiss calls a ""source of empowerment for the members of the gay community"" to have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather jockstraps, using bullwhips as sex toys, and pissing in each other's mouths, at a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays in the military was about to arise, is ludicrous. Any NEA chairperson who had the interests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund the exhibit. Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality more effectively--which, of course, is why he was pleased to draw public attention to the pictures. Now that is what we call an irony of free speech. 

         Awarding funding to the work of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an effort at cultural engineering, and the problem with cultural engineering is the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power. We have a hard enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our society. How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right to speak--of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard? One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor. There are indeed many ironies here. Maybe someone will write a book about them.

         Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss', but the wisdom is conventional. 

         Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument (though it is not quite the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of speech. 

         This is what Fiss means by the ""irony"" in his title: that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it. 

                         The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues: campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes, and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School. 

          The argument is that ""the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty."" The constitutional law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he calls it ""libertarian""--which regarded free speech as a right of individual self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves. 

         Fiss' suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to foster (in William Brennan's words) ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"" debate in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of unorthodox art. 

         The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard, which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to ""self-expression"" but the ""right to property."" Turn-of-the-century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two ""liberalisms"" are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies. 

         Hand, Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as ""the right of the donkey to drool"") but on a democratic need for full and open political debate.

They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves. 

         Fiss' suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to foster (in William Brennan's words) ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"" debate in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of unorthodox art. 

         The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard, which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to ""self-expression"" but the ""right to property."" Turn-of-the-century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two ""liberalisms"" are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies. 

         Hand, Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as ""the right of the donkey to drool"") but on a democratic need for full and open political debate. First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts on precisely that social value--the very value Fiss now proposes we need to insert into First Amendment jurisprudence. We don't need to insert it, because it was there from the start. 

          Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way? Because he wants to line up his own free-speech argument within the conventional academic view that our problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable ideology of liberal individualism, and that they can mostly be solved by adopting a social-constructionist, or communitarian, or ""intersubjective"" view of human nature instead. The merits of liberal individualism vs. communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated. For since the law governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism, the matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in ""self-expression"" with a more up-to-date belief in ""robust debate,"" as Fiss would like to think it does. What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the Hand-Holmes-Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a democratic society, which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as possible, with a different way, which tries to get the state farther into the picture. 

         Here, assuming we want to try the interventionist approach, it is hard to see how a one-size theory can possibly fit all cases. The issues underlying pornography, hate speech, arts grants, campaign finance, and equal-time provisions are all different. The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas, campaign finance and equal-time provisions, is related less to speech, except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old ""right to property""--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry ""opposing viewpoints"" on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like. Fiss believes that the need for equal-time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s, which is peculiar in light of the proliferation of media outlets. But the state does arguably have an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book. 

         Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other issues, rests on a claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase, that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who ""silence"" women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert Mapplethorpe. 

         Fiss' analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach. Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the ""robustness"" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.) 

          Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, ""in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community, so long hidden from view."" This seems completely wrongheaded. People (for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X                 Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism. The notion that it was what Fiss calls a ""source of empowerment for the members of the gay community"" to have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather jockstraps, using bullwhips as sex toys, and pissing in each other's mouths, at a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays in the military was about to arise, is ludicrous. Any NEA chairperson who had the interests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund the exhibit. Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality more effectively--which, of course, is why he was pleased to draw public attention to the pictures. Now that is what we call an irony of free speech. 

         Awarding funding to the work of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an effort at cultural engineering, and the problem with cultural engineering is the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power. We have a hard enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our society. How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right to speak--of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard? One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor. There are indeed many ironies here. Maybe someone will write a book about them.

         Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss', but the wisdom is conventional. 

         Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument (though it is not quite the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of speech. 

         This is what Fiss means by the ""irony"" in his title: that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it. 

                         The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues: campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes, and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School. 

          The argument is that ""the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty."" The constitutional law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he calls it ""libertarian""--which regarded free speech as a right of individual self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard

 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and

         Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss', but the wisdom is conventional. 

         Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument (though it is not quite the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of speech. 

         This is what Fiss means by the ""irony"" in his title: that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it. 

                         The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues: campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes, and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School. 

          The argument is that ""the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty."" The constitutional law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he calls it ""libertarian""--which regarded free speech as a right of individual self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves. 

         Fiss' suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to foster (in William Brennan's words) ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"" debate in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of unorthodox art. 

         The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard, which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to ""self-expression"" but the ""right to property."" Turn-of-the-century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two ""liberalisms"" are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies. 

         Hand, Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as ""the right of the donkey to drool"") but on a democratic need for full and open political debate. First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts on precisely that social value--the very value Fiss now proposes we need to insert into First Amendment jurisprudence. We don't need to insert it, because it was there from the start. 

          Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way? Because he wants to line up his own free-speech argument within the conventional academic view that our problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable ideology of liberal individualism, and that they can mostly be solved by adopting a social-constructionist, or communitarian, or ""intersubjective"" view of human nature instead. The merits of liberal individualism vs. communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated. For since the law governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism, the matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in ""self-expression"" with a more up-to-date belief in ""robust debate,"" as Fiss would like to think it does. What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the Hand-Holmes-Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a democratic society, which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as possible, with a different way, which tries to get the state farther into the picture. 

         Here, assuming we want to try the interventionist approach, it is hard to see how a one-size theory can possibly fit all cases. The issues underlying pornography, hate speech, arts grants, campaign finance, and equal-time provisions are all different. The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas, campaign finance and equal-time provisions, is related less to speech, except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old ""right to property""--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry ""opposing viewpoints"" on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like. Fiss believes that the need for equal-time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s, which is peculiar in light of the proliferation of media outlets. But the state does arguably have an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book. 

         Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other issues, rests on a claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase, that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who ""silence"" women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert Mapplethorpe. 

         Fiss' analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach. Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the ""robustness"" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.) 

          Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, ""in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community, so long hidden from view."" This seems completely wrongheaded. People (for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X                 Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism. The notion that it was what Fiss calls a ""source of empowerment for the members of the gay community"" to have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather jockstraps, using bullwhips as sex toys, and pissing in each other's mouths, at a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays in the military was about to arise, is ludicrous.

         Awarding funding to the work of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an effort at cultural engineering, and the problem with cultural engineering is the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power. We have a hard enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our society. How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right to speak--of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard? One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor.

         Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law. The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech. What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism. The thesis of the book is Fiss', but the wisdom is conventional. 

         Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one, and he has an idea about how we might improve it. The short way to put his argument (though it is not quite the way he puts it) is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive. Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish, and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others, but still, Fiss argues, in the name of freedom of speech. 

         This is what Fiss means by the ""irony"" in his title: that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some. This is not, technically, an irony. It is a paradox. An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails, despite our best efforts, a decrease in freedom for a few. If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit, as an irony, he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say, for he is a learned and temperate writer. But he has, instead, chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged--women, gays, victims of racial-hate speech, the poor (or, at least, the not-rich), and people who are critical of market capitalism--and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like, without running afoul of the First Amendment. Embarked on this task, the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness. Fiss does not avoid it. 

                         The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues: campaign-finance laws, state funding for the arts, pornography, speech codes, and equal time. These discussions are not doctrinaire, but their general inclination is to favor state intervention, on political grounds, in each of those areas--that is, to favor restrictions on campaign spending, greater regulation of pornography, and so on. Fiss' analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument. Light though the sketching is, the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book, since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School. 

          The argument is that ""the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government, [while] the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty."" The constitutional law of free speech, says Fiss, was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism--he calls it ""libertarian""--which regarded free speech as a right of individual self-expression; it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value, equality. Contemporary liberals, inheriting both these traditions, find themselves in a bind. They want, let's say, black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are, racially, in a minority, since liberals worry that black students cannot be ""equal"" if they feel intimidated. But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech, since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves. 

         Fiss' suggestion--this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book--is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty: social vs. individual. The First Amendment, he says, was intended to foster (in William Brennan's words) ""uninhibited, robust, and wide-open"" debate in society as a whole; speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law. We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking--when they utter racial epithets, represent women in degrading ways, use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process, or block the funding of unorthodox art. 

         The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard, which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th -century classical laissez-faire liberalism. It did not. It emerged at the time of World War I, and the principal figures in its creation--Learned Hand, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., and Louis Brandeis--were not classical liberals; they were progressives. They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because, in their time, that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to ""self-expression"" but the ""right to property."" Turn-of-the-century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights; they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights, tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit. Holmes, Brandeis, and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs--the passage of health and safety regulations, the protection of unions, the imposition of taxes, and so on. The post-New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs. The heirs of the19 th -century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich. Fiss' two ""liberalisms"" are, in fact, almost entirely different political philosophies. 

         Hand, Holmes, and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self-expression (an idea Holmes referred to as ""the right of the donkey to drool"") but on a democratic need for full and open political debate. First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts on precisely that social value--the very value Fiss now proposes we need to insert into First Amendment jurisprudence. We don't need to insert it, because it was there from the start. 

          Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way? Because he wants to line up his own free-speech argument within the conventional academic view that our problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable ideology of liberal individualism, and that they can mostly be solved by adopting a social-constructionist, or communitarian, or ""intersubjective"" view of human nature instead. The merits of liberal individualism vs. communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated. For since the law governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism, the matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in ""self-expression"" with a more up-to-date belief in ""robust debate,"" as Fiss would like to think it does. What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the Hand-Holmes-Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a democratic society, which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as possible, with a different way, which tries to get the state farther into the picture. 

         Here, assuming we want to try the interventionist approach, it is hard to see how a one-size theory can possibly fit all cases. The issues underlying pornography, hate speech, arts grants, campaign finance, and equal-time provisions are all different. The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas, campaign finance and equal-time provisions, is related less to speech, except as a kind of constitutional cover, than to a revival of the old ""right to property""--that is, the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry ""opposing viewpoints"" on the grounds that since it's their property, owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like. Fiss believes that the need for equal-time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s, which is peculiar in light of the proliferation of media outlets. But the state does arguably have an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book. 

         Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other issues, rests on a claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase, that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who ""silence"" women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert Mapplethorpe. 

         Fiss' analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach. Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the ""robustness"" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.) 

          Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, ""in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community, so long hidden from view."" This seems completely wrongheaded. People (for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X                 Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism.

But the state does arguably have an interest, compatible with the First Amendment, in stipulating the way those media are used, and Fiss' discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book. 

         Still, that discussion, like his discussions of the other issues, rests on a claim long associated with the left--the claim, in a phrase, that the minority is really the majority. In the case of speech, Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism, the rights of homosexuals, and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them. The public is denied this access because the state, in thrall to the ideology of individualism, refuses either to interfere with speech bullies--such as pornographers--who ""silence"" women, or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox, such as Robert Mapplethorpe. 

         Fiss' analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach. Arts policy is, unquestionably, a mess. The solution usually proposed is divorce: Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria. Fiss rejects both solutions; he wants the criteria to be political. He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the ""robustness"" of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art--though only, of course, if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers, by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion, worthy of its megaphone. (No Nazi art, in other words.) 

          Mapplethorpe's photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines, since, he says, ""in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research. To address those issues the public--represented by the casual museum visitor--needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community, so long hidden from view."" This seems completely wrongheaded. People (for the most part) didn't find Mapplethorpe's X                 Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality. They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism. The notion that it was what Fiss calls a ""source of empowerment for the members of the gay community"" to have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather jockstraps, using bullwhips as sex toys, and pissing in each other's mouths, at a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays in the military was about to arise, is ludicrous. Any NEA chairperson who had the interests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund the exhibit. Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality more effectively--which, of course, is why he was pleased to draw public attention to the pictures. Now that is what we call an irony of free speech. 

         Awarding funding to the work of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an effort at cultural engineering, and the problem with cultural engineering is the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power. We have a hard enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our society. How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right to speak--of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard? One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor. There are indeed many ironies here. Maybe someone will write a book about them.

11,"Let Si Get This 

         During a typical lunch time at the Royalton Hotel restaurant in midtown Manhattan, The                 New Yorker 's Tina Brown might be installed at her usual table, and Vogue 's Anna Wintour might be at her usual table (chewing on her usual meal--a $25 hamburger). Vanity Fair 's Graydon Carter might be there too, although he has transferred his main allegiance to a place called Patroon. Filling out the room are other editors, publicists, and writers from these magazines and GQ and House &amp; Garden and so on. And one man, who probably isn't there himself, picks up every tab. Some of the lesser fry may even utter the Condé Nast mantra--though it is hardly necessary at the Royalton--as they grab for the check: ""Let Si get this."" 

         S.I. ""Si"" Newhouse Jr. and his younger brother, Donald, control Advance Publications, one of America's largest privately held companies. (Estimate of their combined wealth: $13 billion.) Donald tends to Advance's hugely profitable newspaper, radio, and TV holdings. Si runs the less profitable but more glamorous properties. These are the 15 Condé Nast magazines, including (in descending order of fabulousness) Vogue , Vanity Fair , GQ , Condé Nast Traveler , House &amp; Garden , Allure , Details , Self , Mademoiselle , and Glamour ; ; and Random House. 

         The expense-account lunch is a hallowed journalistic tradition. But consider a day in the life of an editor working for Si Newhouse. (Donald's editors are a different story, as they will be happy to tell you.) It's a closed economy where almost all human needs and desires can be gratified with a miraculous, unlimited currency called the Si. 

         A Lincoln Town Car is waiting outside your door in the morning to take you to work. The car, which costs $50 an hour, is written into your contract. First stop, breakfast with a writer at the Four Seasons. The check may be as little as $40. When you reach the office, you realize you're out of cigarettes. No problem--you send your assistant to buy a pack for you. She gets reimbursed from petty cash ($3). (Could be worse for the assistant: She could be forced to pick up her boss's birth-control pills, or her boss's pet from the vet, or presents for her boss's children--regular duties for Condé Nast underlings.) 

         You've forgotten to return the video your kids watched yesterday, so you have a messenger take it back to Blockbuster. Si spends $20; you save a $1.50 late fee. 

          Then there's lunch. The magazines account for more than a quarter of daytime revenues at the Four Seasons and the Royalton. A modest lunch for two at the Royalton (no fancy wine or anything) might cost $80. But Si's generosity extends to even assistants and sub-sub-editors, dining on sushi at their desks. If you spend $10 or less on lunch, and claim you were working, Si pays. At Vogue and Vanity Fair , almost everyone has a ""working lunch"" every day . An editor at Allure says that ""working lunches"" there are limited to 10 a month. 

         Back at the office, you hear that a friend at another Newhouse magazine has been promoted, so you send flowers. The tab: $100. Si pays. (One of my favorite Condé Nast stories is of an editor who had just been promoted to an extremely senior job. His office was jammed with congratulatory flowers and cards. All had been sent by fellow Condé Nast staffers. All had been billed to the company.) Four o'clock, and it's snack time. Your assistant joins the mob in the lobby newsstand. She bills your candy bar, juice, and cigarettes (as well as her own candy bar, juice, and cigarettes) to the magazine ($15). After all, it's a ""working snack."" Later, there's a birthday party for your assistant. You order champagne and a cake--on the company, of course, and present her with your gift--a Prada wallet ($200). Later, she submits the expense sheet for it. Finally, after a Random House book party at Le Cirque 2000 (estimated cost to Si: $35,000), your car ferries you home. 

         Newhouse expense stories are a staple of New York literary-journalistic conversation. Stories about the $10,000 in expenses that a New Yorker editor billed for a single month. About the interior-decorating costs for the fashion-magazine editor who likes to have her office photographs rearranged every few months. About the hotel tab for the big-name New York writer who spent three weeks in Washington's Hay-Adams (basic room: $285 a night) researching a Vanity Fair story that will never run. About the Vogue editor who has furnished her summer house from items purchased for fashion shoots--beautiful furniture, designer pillows, coffee-table books. Vogue assistants have nicknamed the house ""Petty Cash Junction."" 

         None of the 39 past and present Newhouse employees I spoke to for this story would talk on the record, for . And the nature of the subject makes it hard to separate apocrypha from the truth. Did Condé Nast pay, as sources insist it did, hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes on behalf of an editor who didn't bother to file tax forms? Did an editor really expense $20,000 in a weeklong trip to Paris? The people who pay the bills are not talking. But every example of excess cited here was told to me by at least one source (and usually more than one) in a position to know. 

         Need a facial? Treat yourself and bill it to Si. This is what is called ""scouting."" It is also a great way to get free haircuts. To be fair, Si doesn't pay for all such treats. There is also a much-honored tradition of accepting tribute from companies that Condé Nast magazines cover. One magazine exec reportedly got so much loot last Christmas--Cuban cigars, ""crates of wine,"" designer suits (""It was like a Spanish galleon"")--that he needed three cars to cart it home. At yuletide, even midlevel fashion-mag writers and editors are inundated with ""cashmere sweaters, Versace pillows, coats ..."" recalls one ex- Vogue staffer wistfully. 

          At the top of the masthead, the perks are perkier. His Si-ness (their joke, not mine) does not expect his editors in chief to actually live on their million-dollar salaries. He also gives them clothing allowances (up to $50,000 a year). He buys them cars of their choice and hires chauffeurs to drive them. He offers them low- or no-interest home loans. GQ editor Art Cooper reportedly received two $1-million loans, one for a Manhattan apartment, the other for a Connecticut farm. Tina Brown and her husband, Harold Evans, former president of Random House, reportedly just took a $2-million boost to buy a $3.7-million Manhattan house. 

         Si's favorite courtiers lead lives of jaw-dropping privilege. When she was editor of British Vogue , Wintour commuted between London and New York--on the Concorde. Another Si confidant decided his office didn't feel right, so he hired one of the grandmasters of feng shui to rearrange it. Some editors prepare for trips by Federal Expressing their luggage to their destination. Why? ""So you don't have to carry your bags. No one would be caught dead carrying a bag."" 

         Condé Nast has also created a class of mandarin journalists, writers who live much better than they ever could if they wrote only for normal magazines. One free-lancer tells of building much of a summer traveling with her husband in the West and Europe around a couple of Condé Nast assignments. Last summer, The                 New Yorker sent a staffer to Venice to cover the Venice Film Festival. The weeklong trip, which must have cost thousands, resulted in a short piece. 

         Writers, of course, are nowhere near as profligate as photographers. Stories of wasteful shoots abound: the matching seaweed that had to be flown from California to the Caribbean for a fashion photo; the Annie Liebovitz Vanity Fair cover shot of Arnold Schwarzenegger that reportedly cost $100,000; the Vogue shoot in Africa in which, an ex- Vogue editor claims, the photographer and his huge entourage wined and dined to the tune of ""hundreds of thousands of dollars."" 

          And then there are the parties. Last month The                 New Yorker spent--and this is not a joke--$500,000 on a two-day ""Next Conference"" at the Disney Institute in Florida, in connection with a special issue on the same theme. In order to get Vice President Gore, who was traveling in California at the time, The                 New Yorker paid for him and his entourage to fly Air Force Two from California to Florida and back. And vice presidents are not the only things that Condé Nast flies in for parties. The                 New Yorker once shipped silverware from New York to Chicago for a dinner. (""What, they don't have silverware in Chicago?"" asks a New Yorker staffer.) Vanity Fair toted food from New York to Washington for this year's party on the night of the White House Correspondents Dinner. (What, they don't have food in Washington?) 

         That annual Washington do has grown from an after-dinner gathering for drinks at a contributor's apartment to two huge blasts--before and after the dinner itself--at a rented embassy. VF 's annual Oscar-night party has become a similar institution in Hollywood. In addition to the parties themselves, Si also naturally pays to fly in VF staffers and to put them up at top hotels. (What, they don't have editors in Washington or L.A.?) 

         Some Condé Nast parties are so ridiculous that even other Condé Nasties make fun of them. This week's New Yorker , for example, mocks a recent Vogue party in honor of food writer Jeffrey Steingarten. According to The                 New Yorker , Wintour so detested the carpet at Le Cirque 2000 that she ordered the florist to cover it with autumn leaves (handpicked, of course). 

         The apogee of party absurdity is Vanity Fair 's sponsorship of an annual London dinner for the Serpentine Museum in Hyde Park. As one observer puts it, ""Vanity Fair , an American magazine, pays more than $100,000 to a British art museum solely so that it can sponsor a dinner where Graydon Carter gets to sit next to Princess Diana."" The princess was the museum's patron. 

         Actually, paying $100,000 for face time with Princess Di may not have been a foolish investment for a magazine so dependent on peddling her image. And Condé Nast's excess has other plausible justifications as well. 

          Some top editors may earn their perks. Vogue and GQ make millions, according to industry analysts. Vanity Fair is enjoying banner years, and while it probably hasn't made back the millions Newhouse lost in starting it up, it is certainly in the black. The                 New Yorker loses money--how much may even surpass perks as a topic of Newhouse gossip and speculation. On the other hand, The                 New Yorker is the most talked-about magazine in America, and Tina Brown is the most talked-about editor. That is worth something. 

         Public media companies such as Time Warner (or, for that matter, Microsoft) can entice and hold journalists with stock options. Advance is private, so Newhouse uses other golden handcuffs. He runs a lifestyle prison. Top editors stay because they could never afford to live in a house as nice as the one Si's interest-free loan bought them, or to host parties as nice as the ones Si's party planners throw for them. 

         Condé Nast's magazines are all about glamour, wealth, prestige. To uphold that image, magazine editors need to circulate at the top of New York society. But the top of New York society consists of people who make far more money than magazine editors do--investment bankers, corporate chieftains, and fashion designers. Million-dollar salaries aren't enough to mix as equals with the Trumps and Karans. Si's perks are equalizers. 

         And they say it's not as good as it used to be. In 1992, according to Thomas Maier's biography of Newhouse, the editor of Self held a birthday party for Si Newhouse's dog . (Owners ate caviar; dogs drank Evian.) The lowliest assistants used to take car services home. But new Condé Nast CEO Steve Florio has restricted cars and catering. Editors who used to fly the Concorde now fly first-class; those who used to fly first-class now fly business. Expense accounts are scrutinized. Even so, today's Condé Nast is economical only by Condé Nast standards. The belt is tighter, but it's still hand-tooled, hand-tanned, and fashioned from the finest Italian leather.

         Sunday, Jan. 14, 1996: A day that will live in--well, not infamy, exactly. Blasphemy would be closer to it. 

         Early that afternoon, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the American Football Conference championship. Linebacker Greg Lloyd, accepting the trophy in front of a national television audience, responded with enthusiasm. ""Let's see if we can bring this damn thing back here next year,"" he said, ""along with the [expletive] Super Bowl."" 

         A few hours later, Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defense of his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference title: ""Nobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer. He took all of this [expletive] ."" 

         Iwatched those episodes, and, incongruous as it may sound, I thought of Kenneth Tynan. Britain's great postwar drama critic was no fan of American football, but he was a fan of swearing. Thirty years earlier, almost to the week, Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity as literary director of Britain's National Theater and asked if he would allow the theater to present a play in which sex took place on stage. ""Certainly,"" he replied. ""I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom the word '[expletive]' is particularly diabolical or revolting or totally forbidden."" 

         It turned out there were a few more than Tynan thought. Within 24 hours, resolutions had been introduced in the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenity, for his removal as a theater official, and for censure of the network for allowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves. Tynan escaped punishment, but he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for the rest his life. To much of ordinary Britain, he became the man who had said ""[expletive]"" on the BBC. 

         Neither Greg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized. ""It's live television,"" NBC Vice President Ed Markey said, rationalizing the outbursts. ""It's an emotional moment. These things happen."" Irvin wasn't about to let that stand. ""I knew exactly what I was saying,"" he insisted later. ""Those of you who can't believe I said it--believe it."" 

         Swearing isn't the only public act that Western civilization condones today but didn't 30 years ago. But it is one of the most interesting. It is everywhere, impossible to avoid or tune out. 

           

          

            I am sitting in a meeting at the office, talking with a colleague about a business circumstance that may possibly go against us. ""In that case, we're [expletive] ,"" he says. Five years ago, he would have said ""screwed."" Twenty years ago, he would have said, ""We're in big trouble."" Societal tolerance of profanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on.   

             

            I am walking along a suburban street, trailing a class of pre-schoolers who are linked to each other by a rope. A pair of teen-agers passes us in the other direction. By the time they have reached the end of the line of children, they have tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I was well into adolescence, let alone use in casual conversation on a public street.   

             

            I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about a foundation grant. I tell her something she wasn't aware of before. In 1965, the appropriate response was ""no kidding."" In 1996, you do not say ""no kidding."" It is limp and ineffectual. If you are surprised at all, you say what she says: ""No shit."" 

          

         What word is taboo in middle-class America in 1996? There are a couple of credible candidates: The four-letter word for ""vagina"" remains off-limits in polite conversation (although that has more to do with feminism than with profanity), and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sex with males is not yet acceptable by the standards of office-meeting etiquette. 

         But aside from a few exceptions, the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost to nothing as the 20th century comes to an end; the currency of swearing has been inflated to the brink of worthlessness. When almost anything can be said in public, profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all. 

         That most of the forbidden words of the 1950s are no longer forbidden will come as news to nobody: The steady debasement of the common language is only one of many social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to the current. What is important is that profanity served a variety of purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes any more. 

         What purposes? There are a couple of plausible answers. One of them is emotional release. Robert Graves, who wrote a book in the 1920s called The Future of Swearing , thought that profanity was the adult replacement for childhood tears. There comes a point in life, he wrote, when ""wailing is rightly discouraged, and groans are also considered a signal of extreme weakness. Silence under suffering is usually impossible."" So one reaches back for a word one does not normally use, and utters it without undue embarrassment or guilt. And one feels better--even stimulated. 

         The anthropologist Ashley Montagu, whose Anatomy of Swearing , published in 1967, is the definitive modern take on the subject, saw profanity as a safety valve rather than a stimulant, a verbal substitute for physical aggression. When someone swears, Montagu wrote, ""potentially noxious energy is converted into a form that renders it comparatively innocuous."" 

         One could point out, in arguing against the safety-valve theory, that as America has grown more profane in the past 30 years, it has also grown more violent, not less. But this is too simple. It isn't just the supply of dirty words that matters, it's their emotive power. If they have lost that power through overuse, it's perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deter aggressive behavior has weakened as well. 

         But there is something else important to say about swearing--that it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considers powerful, awesome, and a little scary. 

         I'm not sure there is an easy way to convey to anybody under 30, for example, the sheer emotive force that the word ""[expletive]"" possessed in the urban childhood culture of 40 years ago. It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood but that was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world. It was the embodiment of both pleasure and danger. It was not a word or an idea to mess with. When it was used, it was used, as Ashley Montagu said, ""sotto voce , like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbidden frontier."" 

         In that culture, the word ""[expletive]"" was not only obscene, it was profane, in the original sense: It took an important idea in vain. Profanity can be an act of religious defiance, but it doesn't have to be. The Greeks tempted fate by invoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus; they also swore upon everyday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understand. ""By the Cabbage!"" Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress, and that was for good reason. He believed that cabbage cured hangovers, and as such, carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with the requisite emotional charge. 

         These days, none of us believes in cabbage in the way Socrates did, or in the gods in the way most Athenians did. Most Americans tell poll-takers that they believe in God, but few of them in a way that would make it impossible to take His name in vain: That requires an Old Testament piety that disappeared from American middle-class life a long time ago. 

         Nor do we believe in sex any more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it a generation ago: as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did not engage in, or discuss, or even invoke, without a certain amount of excitement and risk. We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it just doesn't carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedrooms of the 1950s. 

         Many enlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society in which sex generated not only emotion and power, but fear. For the moment, I wish to insist only on this one point: When sexuality loses its power to awe, it loses its power to create genuine swearing. When we convert it into a casual form of recreation, we shouldn't be surprised to hear linebackers using the word ""[expletive]"" on national television. 

         To profane something, in other words, one must believe in it. The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against them. 

         The instinctive response of most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it, but this is wrong. Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos and prohibitions, if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure and define themselves. By violating these taboos over and over, some succeed in defining themselves as rebels. Others violate them on special occasions to derive an emotional release. Forbidden language is one of the ways we remind children that there are rules to everyday life, and consequences for breaking them. When we forget this principle, or cease to accept it, it is not just our language that begins to fray at the edges. 

         What do we do about it? Well, we could pass a law against swearing. Mussolini actually did that. He decreed that trains and buses, in addition to running on time, had to carry signs that read ""Non bestemmiare per l'onore d'Italia."" (""Do not swear for the honor of Italy."") The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as you would expect: They cursed them. 

         What Mussolini could not do, I am reasonably sure that American governments of the 1990s cannot do, nor would I wish it. I merely predict that sometime in the coming generation, profanity will return in a meaningful way. It served too many purposes for too many years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis. We need it. 

         And so I am reasonably sure that when my children have children, there will once again be words so awesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences. This will not only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution, it will be a token of moral revival. What the dirty words will be, God only knows.

         Now and then, a documentary film comes along that makes us re-examine the rules that unofficially govern the genre: Can there be a middle ground between fiction and fact? Can a documentary use scripted scenes and yet remain ontologically authentic? How much can you stylize material before you alter the reality that you're striving, at least in theory, to capture? 

                         Unmade Beds , Nicholas Barker's "" 'real life' feature film,"" has proudly worn its mongrel status as a ""directed"" documentary of single life in the big city, employing, in the face of criticism, what amounts to a cackling-punk defiance. The movie tracks four aging New Yorkers--two men, two women--through their lonely dating rituals, in the process depicting a universe of lusty, coupled-up haves and downcast, excluded have-nots, all viewed Rear Window -style through rectangular openings in the massive apartment houses in which they reside. 

         This is not cinema                 vérité , and nothing has been left to chance. The director selected his four subjects from many hundreds of potential candidates, followed them around for months, and then scripted their monologues and dialogues to reflect what he says he saw. Calling his own film ""an exercise in mendacity,"" Barker goes on, ""I'm quite happy to tell lies about my characters and even collude with their self-delusions if it enables me to communicate larger dramatic truths."" 

         Spurned by U.S. distributors, Unmade Beds opened two weeks ago in a small screening room in downtown Manhattan, where it proceeded to set box office records and generate lots of (largely favorable) press. In part due to smart publicity, which has bannered some of the bad reviews and commentary (""I have to tell you that this film upset me so much that I really don't want to have anything to do with it""--a New York publicist), it threatens to become a cause                 célèbre --and to be coming soon to a theater near you. It's always nice to see distributors proved wrong about the merits of ""difficult"" films, but in this case I think they did the decent thing. Unmade Beds isn't just bad--it's obnoxiously, noxiously bad, a freak show for the empathetically challenged. The outrage it has prompted isn't the Puritan kind; it's more like legitimate revulsion at watching a blowhard pervert people's lives in the name of ""larger dramatic truths."" 

         Those truths are large, all right. Take Michael, the 40-year-old, 5 foot 4 inch lonely guy who has been looking for a wife for almost two decades. If you were to walk past him on the street, you might think that a man of his small stature might have some trouble getting dates and be rather bitter about it. The larger dramatic truth is that Michael has lots of trouble getting dates and is very bitter about it. Just in case you feel too sorry for him, however, Barker is careful to include a homophobic monologue in which Michael complains about young women who waste their lives hanging out with effeminate males. 

          Michael turns out to be the film's most sympathetic subject--by a wide margin. At least he's not Mikey, a paunchy 54-year-old who writes but can't sell screenplays and who always flees blind dates, because the women he gets fixed up with are ""mutts."" Sounding like one of the low-level gangsters who posture like kingpins in Donnie Brasco , Mikey talks a lot about mutts. He also reminisces about that 24 hour period in the '70s when he managed to sleep with three different beautiful women, whose pictures he shows off. These days, all he meets are mutts. He comes off as a pathetic little loser--a mutt. 

         Aimee, on the other hand, is a pathetic big loser, weighing in at 225 pounds. Determined to get married before she turns 30, she generally is filmed beside bags of groceries and assorted junk foods. She cries about her situation to her thin friend, Laurie, who, in one scene, gently mentions Aimee's weight. Clearly the scene is scripted, but Aimee does a good job acting taken aback. She has always been fat--and she's ""OK with it,"" and a man just has to accept it. This is followed by more talk about how you attract men. Will they respect you if you call them back? If you express too much interest? ""Or,"" the viewer thinks, ""if you're 225 pounds?"" 

         The only natural performer here is Brenda, a garrulous exhibitionist who blossoms with the camera on her--she could have a career as a Penny Marshall-style character actress. Divorced and aging, Brenda needs money and is willing to charge for her sexual services. It shouldn't be too difficult, because men are always showing her their dicks (""I'm up to two dicks a day""). They meet her and, a few minutes later, they show her their dicks. Weird, huh? What Barker leaves out (it's in a New York Observer article) is that Brenda, a former lap dancer, works in marketing at a strip joint. Presumably, men standing next to her in line at McDonald's don't show her their dicks. Nor, presumably, does she show them her breasts--although she bares them for Barker's camera, jabbering about her body while she doffs her clothes and steps into the shower and soaps up. 

         Barker might have crafted his subjects' monologues from their own words, but he has robbed them of their spontaneity--and, thus, of their essence. They aren't thinking or trying to come to grips with their situations in front of your eyes, because they already know what they're going to say: They've been fixed like butterflies on the ends of pins and held up for voyeuristic inspection. The scenes with friends and confidantes have a crude, programmatic purpose. You can imagine the director composing a shot (the shots are tightly composed and elaborately lighted) and reminding them, ""In this scene she points out that you should lose weight and you get shocked and defensive. Ready ... Action."" 

          Call me square, but I find this antithetical to the documentary spirit. An Englishman who trained as an anthropologist before going to work for BBC Television, Barker clearly made up his mind about his material before his cameras began to roll--so it's no surprise that it feels prechewed and predigested. When reality interfered (Brenda apparently did not go through with a marriage to an immigrant in search of a green card for $10,000, as she does on-screen), Barker brushed the truth aside as immaterial, following her up the steps of City Hall in her wedding dress because it was ""true to her character."" But what separates documentary from fiction is that real people are often more complicated, and more conflicted, than finished characters--as Brenda proved to be more (or, at least, other) than the sum of her parts. That's the kind of truth that reveals itself to documentary filmmakers after the fact, when they go over footage and discover unexpected patterns, dissonances, glimmers of a universe that's richer and messier than the one they set out to portray. 

         So what are Barker's ""larger dramatic truths""? Single people in big cities can be desperate. Single people fear they're going to die alone--unloved and unloving. People are judged and, in turn, judge others by how they look. Big news. One could argue, charitably, that the movie is meant to be prescriptive, that Barker intends for us to regard the ways in which his subjects delude themselves and thereby learn to see through our own self-delusions. But Barker hasn't concocted a larger dramatic structure that would hold those larger dramatic truths together and help us comprehend where these people went wrong. He dramatizes right up to the point where a dramatist would be expected to provide some insight--and then, hey, he's a documentarian. 

                         Unmade Beds might make a good date movie. There's little to argue about in its subjects' personalities--both males and females will find them repulsive--and the picture the film paints of single life in the big city is so bleak that you'll probably want to jump into bed with whoever is sitting next to you. Anything to keep from turning into one of those people. 

         The Slums of Beverly Hills also walks a line between two genres, in this case coming-of-age sex comedy and autobiographical monologue. Tamara Jenkins, the writer and first-time director, has an eye for absurd juxtapositions that was obviously sharpened by the pain of her nomadic upbringing. Her protagonist (Natasha Lyonne) spends her teen-age years being shuttled with her two brothers from one cheap dive to another in the 90210 ZIP code, all because her egregiously unsuccessful father (Alan Arkin) wants them to be educated in the best schools. (""Furniture's temporary; education is permanent."") It's a major omission, then, that we never see those schools or the kids' interaction with their stable, well-to-do Beverly Hills counterparts. We can't tell if the father is, on some weird level, justified in his fervor, or whether he's screwing up his children--subjecting them to humiliation and robbing them of a sense of permanence--for no reason. Jenkins hasn't quite figured out how to shape her narrative, which is full of episodes that are there because they actually happened but that don't have a payoff. I almost wish she'd included more voice-over narration, more commentary on the things that, as a filmmaker, she hasn't learned to bring out. 

                         The Slums of Beverly Hills never gels, but it has a likable spirit, and it's exceedingly easy on the eye, with lots of pretty girls and wry evocations of '70s fashions and decor. The father, to obtain financial support from his wealthy brother (Carl Reiner), volunteers to take in his vaguely schizzy, dipsomaniacal niece (Marisa Tomei). She and her cousin compare breasts, play with vibrators, and talk in pig Latinish gibberish, but Jenkins never lets the proceedings get too sentimental: The whimsy is always cut with an acidic awareness of the family's desperation. ""Are we middle-class now?"" ask the children, hopefully, before another crisis sends them back into their van, cruising past the movie stars' mansions, in the mean streets of Beverly Hills. 

          Grading on the steep curve established by summer blockbuster seasons past, these have turned out to be a pretty good few months at the movies. Even the commercial swill ( Deep Impact , Armageddon , The Mask of Zorro , Small Soldiers , Snake Eyes , Halloween: H20 ) has been of a high grade, and Saving Private Ryan and Return to Paradise were Vitalis slaps in the kisser for people woozy from all the warm weather escapism. Out of Sight was tender and charming, as was, in its gross-out way, There's Something About Mary . And, on the indie front, The Opposite of Sex , Buffalo 66 , and Pi have proved that there's still commercial life after Sundance. Sure, we had stinkers, but even Godzilla was fun to jeer at. And there's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class. 

         I don't know who the credited screenwriter, Don MacPherson, is, but it's unlikely that he has ever seen an episode of the old Avengers , let alone sussed out the source of its appeal. Opening with a slapstick sequence of agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) doing kung fu, the film shifts to a scene in which he meets Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) while sitting naked in a sauna with only a newspaper to cover his private parts. The series was erotic in a way only prim English humor can be: The Old Boy Steed was capable of throwing a punch and bonking someone with his bowler, but he left the karate kicking to his liberated, leather-suited distaff associate. Here their roles have been witlessly muddled, and MacPherson's idea of banter is to have the pair complete each other's clichés. 

         Whereas the original Steed, Patrick Macnee, was to the English Men's Club born, Fiennes is an eternal caddie. The willowy Thurman looks great in her outfits, but it's ever more apparent that she isn't much of an actress--at least, not a trained one--and her attempts at insouciance are embarrassingly arch. As the eccentric master villain who controls the weather, even Sean Connery is flat-out terrible, acting high on the hog. To think Connery once found the Bond films so far beneath him! When he sputters lines like ""Time to die!"" one imagines Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Blofeld snickering in the wings.
",0,"The film review author gives all of the following reasons for his negative critique toward ""Unmade Beds"" EXCEPT that:",2,he believes the characters to be so vulgar that the audience cannot empathize with them,1,he believes its scripted nature does not qualify it as a true documentary film
13,"Dirty Laundry 

         Now and then, a documentary film comes along that makes us re-examine the rules that unofficially govern the genre: Can there be a middle ground between fiction and fact? Can a documentary use scripted scenes and yet remain ontologically authentic? How much can you stylize material before you alter the reality that you're striving, at least in theory, to capture? 

                         Unmade Beds , Nicholas Barker's "" 'real life' feature film,"" has proudly worn its mongrel status as a ""directed"" documentary of single life in the big city, employing, in the face of criticism, what amounts to a cackling-punk defiance. The movie tracks four aging New Yorkers--two men, two women--through their lonely dating rituals, in the process depicting a universe of lusty, coupled-up haves and downcast, excluded have-nots, all viewed Rear Window -style through rectangular openings in the massive apartment houses in which they reside. 

         This is not cinema                 vérité , and nothing has been left to chance. The director selected his four subjects from many hundreds of potential candidates, followed them around for months, and then scripted their monologues and dialogues to reflect what he says he saw. Calling his own film ""an exercise in mendacity,"" Barker goes on, ""I'm quite happy to tell lies about my characters and even collude with their self-delusions if it enables me to communicate larger dramatic truths."" 

         Spurned by U.S. distributors, Unmade Beds opened two weeks ago in a small screening room in downtown Manhattan, where it proceeded to set box office records and generate lots of (largely favorable) press. In part due to smart publicity, which has bannered some of the bad reviews and commentary (""I have to tell you that this film upset me so much that I really don't want to have anything to do with it""--a New York publicist), it threatens to become a cause                 célèbre --and to be coming soon to a theater near you. It's always nice to see distributors proved wrong about the merits of ""difficult"" films, but in this case I think they did the decent thing. Unmade Beds isn't just bad--it's obnoxiously, noxiously bad, a freak show for the empathetically challenged. The outrage it has prompted isn't the Puritan kind; it's more like legitimate revulsion at watching a blowhard pervert people's lives in the name of ""larger dramatic truths."" 

         Those truths are large, all right. Take Michael, the 40-year-old, 5 foot 4 inch lonely guy who has been looking for a wife for almost two decades. If you were to walk past him on the street, you might think that a man of his small stature might have some trouble getting dates and be rather bitter about it. The larger dramatic truth is that Michael has lots of trouble getting dates and is very bitter about it. Just in case you feel too sorry for him, however, Barker is careful to include a homophobic monologue in which Michael complains about young women who waste their lives hanging out with effeminate males. 

          Michael turns out to be the film's most sympathetic subject--by a wide margin. At least he's not Mikey, a paunchy 54-year-old who writes but can't sell screenplays and who always flees blind dates, because the women he gets fixed up with are ""mutts."" Sounding like one of the low-level gangsters who posture like kingpins in Donnie Brasco , Mikey talks a lot about mutts. He also reminisces about that 24 hour period in the '70s when he managed to sleep with three different beautiful women, whose pictures he shows off. These days, all he meets are mutts. He comes off as a pathetic little loser--a mutt. 

         Aimee, on the other hand, is a pathetic big loser, weighing in at 225 pounds. Determined to get married before she turns 30, she generally is filmed beside bags of groceries and assorted junk foods. She cries about her situation to her thin friend, Laurie, who, in one scene, gently mentions Aimee's weight. Clearly the scene is scripted, but Aimee does a good job acting taken aback. She has always been fat--and she's ""OK with it,"" and a man just has to accept it. This is followed by more talk about how you attract men. Will they respect you if you call them back? If you express too much interest? ""Or,"" the viewer thinks, ""if you're 225 pounds?"" 

         The only natural performer here is Brenda, a garrulous exhibitionist who blossoms with the camera on her--she could have a career as a Penny Marshall-style character actress. Divorced and aging, Brenda needs money and is willing to charge for her sexual services. It shouldn't be too difficult, because men are always showing her their dicks (""I'm up to two dicks a day""). They meet her and, a few minutes later, they show her their dicks. Weird, huh? What Barker leaves out (it's in a New York Observer article) is that Brenda, a former lap dancer, works in marketing at a strip joint. Presumably, men standing next to her in line at McDonald's don't show her their dicks. Nor, presumably, does she show them her breasts--although she bares them for Barker's camera, jabbering about her body while she doffs her clothes and steps into the shower and soaps up. 

         Barker might have crafted his subjects' monologues from their own words, but he has robbed them of their spontaneity--and, thus, of their essence. They aren't thinking or trying to come to grips with their situations in front of your eyes, because they already know what they're going to say: They've been fixed like butterflies on the ends of pins and held up for voyeuristic inspection. The scenes with friends and confidantes have a crude, programmatic purpose. You can imagine the director composing a shot (the shots are tightly composed and elaborately lighted) and reminding them, ""In this scene she points out that you should lose weight and you get shocked and defensive. Ready ... Action."" 

          Call me square, but I find this antithetical to the documentary spirit. An Englishman who trained as an anthropologist before going to work for BBC Television, Barker clearly made up his mind about his material before his cameras began to roll--so it's no surprise that it feels prechewed and predigested. When reality interfered (Brenda apparently did not go through with a marriage to an immigrant in search of a green card for $10,000, as she does on-screen), Barker brushed the truth aside as immaterial, following her up the steps of City Hall in her wedding dress because it was ""true to her character."" But what separates documentary from fiction is that real people are often more complicated, and more conflicted, than finished characters--as Brenda proved to be more (or, at least, other) than the sum of her parts. That's the kind of truth that reveals itself to documentary filmmakers after the fact, when they go over footage and discover unexpected patterns, dissonances, glimmers of a universe that's richer and messier than the one they set out to portray. 

         So what are Barker's ""larger dramatic truths""? Single people in big cities can be desperate. Single people fear they're going to die alone--unloved and unloving. People are judged and, in turn, judge others by how they look. Big news. One could argue, charitably, that the movie is meant to be prescriptive, that Barker intends for us to regard the ways in which his subjects delude themselves and thereby learn to see through our own self-delusions. But Barker hasn't concocted a larger dramatic structure that would hold those larger dramatic truths together and help us comprehend where these people went wrong. He dramatizes right up to the point where a dramatist would be expected to provide some insight--and then, hey, he's a documentarian.

And there's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class. 

         I don't know who the credited screenwriter, Don MacPherson, is, but it's unlikely that he has ever seen an episode of the old Avengers , let alone sussed out the source of its appeal. Opening with a slapstick sequence of agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) doing kung fu, the film shifts to a scene in which he meets Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) while sitting naked in a sauna with only a newspaper to cover his private parts. The series was erotic in a way only prim English humor can be: The Old Boy Steed was capable of throwing a punch and bonking someone with his bowler, but he left the karate kicking to his liberated, leather-suited distaff associate. Here their roles have been witlessly muddled, and MacPherson's idea of banter is to have the pair complete each other's clichés. 

         Whereas the original Steed, Patrick Macnee, was to the English Men's Club born, Fiennes is an eternal caddie. The willowy Thurman looks great in her outfits, but it's ever more apparent that she isn't much of an actress--at least, not a trained one--and her attempts at insouciance are embarrassingly arch. As the eccentric master villain who controls the weather, even Sean Connery is flat-out terrible, acting high on the hog. To think Connery once found the Bond films so far beneath him! When he sputters lines like ""Time to die!"" one imagines Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Blofeld snickering in the wings.

14,"War and Pieces 

         No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful, rambling war epic The Thin Red Line , Terrence Malick's return to cinema after 20 years. I've sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out my responses, which run from awe to mockery and back. Like Saving Private Ryan , the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant, splattery battle montages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth. But Malick, a certified intellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands and Days                 of                 Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared, is in a different philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg. Post-carnage, his sundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy, runic voice-overs that come at you like slow bean balls: ""Why does nature vie with itself? ... Is there an avenging power in nature, not one power but two?"" Or ""This great evil: Where's it come from? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us, robbin' us of life and light?"" First you get walloped with viscera, then you get beaned by blather. 

         Those existential speculations don't derive from the screenplay's source, an archetypal but otherwise down-to-earth 1962 novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Here to Eternity ) about the American invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal. They're central to Malick's vision of the story, however, and not specious. In the combat genre, the phrase ""war is hell"" usually means nothing more than that it's a bummer to lose a limb or two, or to see your buddy get his head blown off. A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God. 

         He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with a big-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars (John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. After an Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophical terrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In the final shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle of life beginning anew. 

                         The Thin Red Line has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalist New Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife, viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If the movie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who's increasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-like optimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain't no world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen another world."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh's vindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turns out to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife and love: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining."" 

         Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen: soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds of images: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know the man, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small, white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall, yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal, laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that I was, too."" 

         Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--is nature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for all his startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte's ambition-crazed Tall and Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on a bunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick. Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a war or a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation. In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotes Homer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck the men up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazy figures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselves frantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded, flutters in the grass. 

         Malick is convincing--at times overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with? Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have an easier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies' cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy into Spielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter, World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he was at Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headed mentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and are killed, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last several centuries. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness. 

         John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him a jump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in the book the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke (stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria. 

         Director Steven Zaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip. Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He might succeed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm's financial resources dwindle to nothing. 

         Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes a more surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta. Beatrice and Grace made out OK legally, but some of us will never use their products again without thinking about Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted-away little kids.

Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on a bunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick. Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a war or a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation. In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotes Homer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck the men up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazy figures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselves frantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded, flutters in the grass. 

         Malick is convincing--at times overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with? Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have an easier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies' cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy into Spielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter, World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he was at Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headed mentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and are killed, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last several centuries. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness. 

         John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him a jump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in the book the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke (stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria. 

         Director Steven Zaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip. Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He might succeed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm's financial resources dwindle to nothing. 

         Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes a more surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta.

14,"War and Pieces 

         No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful, rambling war epic The Thin Red Line , Terrence Malick's return to cinema after 20 years. I've sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out my responses, which run from awe to mockery and back. Like Saving Private Ryan , the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant, splattery battle montages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth. But Malick, a certified intellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands and Days                 of                 Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared, is in a different philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg. Post-carnage, his sundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy, runic voice-overs that come at you like slow bean balls: ""Why does nature vie with itself? ... Is there an avenging power in nature, not one power but two?"" Or ""This great evil: Where's it come from? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us, robbin' us of life and light?"" First you get walloped with viscera, then you get beaned by blather. 

         Those existential speculations don't derive from the screenplay's source, an archetypal but otherwise down-to-earth 1962 novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Here to Eternity ) about the American invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal. They're central to Malick's vision of the story, however, and not specious. In the combat genre, the phrase ""war is hell"" usually means nothing more than that it's a bummer to lose a limb or two, or to see your buddy get his head blown off. A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God. 

         He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with a big-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars (John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. After an Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophical terrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In the final shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle of life beginning anew. 

                         The Thin Red Line has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalist New Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife, viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If the movie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who's increasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-like optimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain't no world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen another world."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh's vindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turns out to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife and love: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining."" 

         Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen: soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds of images: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know the man, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small, white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall, yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal, laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that I was, too."" 

         Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--is nature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for all his startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte's ambition-crazed Tall and Capt.

A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God. 

         He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with a big-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars (John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. After an Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophical terrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In the final shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle of life beginning anew. 

                         The Thin Red Line has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalist New Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife, viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If the movie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who's increasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-like optimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain't no world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen another world."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh's vindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turns out to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife and love: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining."" 

         Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen: soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds of images: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know the man, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small, white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall, yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal, laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that I was, too."" 

         Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--is nature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for all his startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte's ambition-crazed Tall and Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on a bunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick. Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a war or a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation. In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotes Homer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck the men up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazy figures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselves frantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded, flutters in the grass. 

         Malick is convincing--at times overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with? Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have an easier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies' cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy into Spielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter, World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he was at Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headed mentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and are killed, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last several centuries. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness. 

         John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him a jump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in the book the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke (stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria. 

         Director Steven Zaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip. Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He might succeed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm's financial resources dwindle to nothing. 

         Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes a more surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta. Beatrice and Grace made out OK legally, but some of us will never use their products again without thinking about Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted-away little kids.

15,"Warrior Queens 

                         Elizabeth is a lurid paraphrase of the old Groucho Marx line about Doris Day: ""I knew the Virgin Queen before she was a virgin."" As the movie tells it, she was a sylvan, redheaded princess (Cate Blanchett) given to gamboling with her fella (Joseph Fiennes) between periods of internment in the Tower of London on charges of conspiring to overthrow her half-sister, the heatedly Catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke). The daughter of the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and therefore dubbed a bastard by the papists, the Protestant Elizabeth ascends the throne to find the air still thick with smoke from roasted heretics, a team of skulking Catholics plotting her assassination, and a council of advisers (lords, bishops, sundry old boys) who snigger openly at the prospect of taking orders from a woman. Only a strategic marriage to a Spaniard or a Frenchman will mollify all factions, her advisers insist, but the pickings prove dismal. (Her French suitor enjoys wearing dresses.) After skulls are smashed, throats slit, and bosoms skewered in the name of Christ, Elizabeth decides to: a) ""unsex"" herself and become a symbol--the Virgin Queen, married only to England; and b) entertain dissenting opinions exclusively from those whose heads are affixed to spikes. 

         You can't be both a queenly queen and a womanly woman, says the script (by Michael Hirst)--at least not in 1554. (The director, Shekhar Kapur, made the same point in his grim 1994 Indian epic The Bandit Queen , against a backdrop of scrubby plains along the Ganges.) Is this feminist take historically accurate? Probably, although the evidence suggests that Elizabeth had developed a head for stratagems earlier in life (her position had been precarious since the beheading of her mother) and came to the throne with few girlish illusions about How Things Work in a barbarous state. 

         That said, the movie's approach makes for juicy melodrama. The tone of Elizabeth comes nearer to the nihilistic relish of Jacobeans such as John Ford and John Webster than to the more sorrowful horror of the Elizabethan dramatists Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare. It's even closer to a Jacobean drama of our own age: The Godfather (1972), which it emulates by cutting back-and-forth between queen and courtiers in prayer and the roundup and slaughter of Catholics on their privies, in bed with their mistresses, and so on. Their severed heads look on, wide-eyed, as Elizabeth directs her hair to be shorn--images of her girlhood flashing by as her locks rain down--and then walks weightily to her throne, now a chalk-faced gorgon. 

         With all due respect to Blanchett, Bette Davis, and Glenda Jackson, my favorite Elizabeth I remains Miranda Richardson's capricious, baby-talking psychopath on the BBC comedy Blackadder II . (Casting about for a new lord high executioner, she mews to Rowan Atkinson, ""There are thousands of Catholics simply dying to have their heads sneaked off --and there's no one to organize it."") But Blanchett comes in a close second, pulling off the transition from hapless young woman to coolly ruthless monarch with uncommon subtlety. Gradually expunging all empathy from her moist, pink eyes and permitting her visage to ossify, she gives this carnival of carnage an awe-inspiring center. 

          A more subversive sort of queen is on display in Velvet Goldmine , Todd Haynes' musical fantasia on the early '70s era of ""glam"" or ""glitter"" rock. Here the monarch is a David Bowie-esque singer called Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his spidery, space-age alter ego, Maxwell Demon. The movie opens with a spaceship depositing an infant Oscar Wilde on the stoop of a Dublin townhouse. Then it skips ahead to track a jade pin (it signifies hedonistic liberation) from the custody of a young Wilde to a swishy fringe creature called Jack Fairy to the regal Slade, a bisexual superstar who carries the news to all the young dudes. After that, we're in an Orwellian 1984 that's presided over by a vaguely fascist president and by arena rockers who serve as propagandists for a repressively conformist state. Whatever happened to Brian Slade, the glitter kids, the visionary exhibitionists and gleeful poseurs? Borrowing its framework from Citizen Kane , the movie follows a reporter (Christian Bale) assigned to reconstruct Slade's life and solve the mystery of his whereabouts. 

         Whatever you make of Velvet Goldmine (opinions have ranged from rapturous to casually dismissive), it's like no other musical ever made. It's determinedly swirling, discursive, elliptical. Now the story is told by an omniscient narrator, now a TV reporter, now a participant. Now it's flashing back, now forward. Every other line of dialogue is a cue for one of its dazzling numbers, largely covers of songs by Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, and T. Rex. The narrative is a challenge to keep up with, but then, great artists often invent their own syntax. In the '80s, Haynes employed Barbie dolls to depict the rise and wasting away from anorexia of the singer Karen Carpenter. Lucky audiences who caught Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (it was shelved when Richard Carpenter served the producers with an order to cease and desist exhibition) began by laughing at this elaborately posed, soft-rock femme, only to discover by the climax that the cultural forces that were eating at her (and that kept her from eating) had grown heartbreakingly palpable. Poison (1991), Haynes' Genêt-inspired exploration of transgression, didn't overcome its own artiness. But Safe (1995), the story of a Reagan-era housewife (Julianne Moore) convinced that her environment is poisoning her, is an entrancing meditation on the power of culture to crush the individual. Despite its ironic detachment, the film draws you into its heroine's sickly state: Breathing oxygen from a canister inside a high-tech igloo, she dwindles to nearly nothing, the modern incarnation of the Incredible Shrinking Man. 

         (It was partly my passion for Haynes' films that led me to accept a job offer from his indefatigable producer Christine Vachon last year to collaborate on a nuts-and-bolts book about producing, Shooting To Kill . So my review of Velvet Goldmine --like my review of Vachon's other recent release, Happiness --should be read as the work of a partisan. But not a blind partisan.) 

         In Velvet Goldmine , Haynes sets out to demonstrate the power of popular music to change people's lives--to tell them it's OK to fashion themselves into anything they please. The core of the movie turns out not to be the Bowie figure but the journalist, Arthur Stuart, who was a witness to the events he's now reconstructing. Bale is such an expressive performer that Stuart's remembrance of things past attains a Proustian intensity. To him, Slade was a sexual messiah. I've never seen a more vivid distillation of rock's allure than the scene in which he reverently opens the new Brian Slade album--its centerfold image is a lithe, naked, green-tinged Maxwell Demon--slips the vinyl out of its paper jacket and, after gingerly setting the LP on the turntable, props a chair under the doorknob to keep the uncomprehending world at bay. 

         But if Haynes wants Velvet Goldmine to be an anthem to the principles Bowie once embodied--the embrace of artifice and the smashing of conventional sexual roles--he also wants to portray the rocker as a hollow opportunist who abandoned glam and bisexuality for the life of a corporate superstar, throwing in his lot with the forces of repression. That's a lot to cover. An actor of stature might have bridged these two impulses, but the beautiful, brazenly slim-hipped Rhys-Meyers doesn't make his lines sound as if he's thinking them up on the spot, and Slade's self-destructive passion for Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), the film's fuzzy, sweet Iggy Pop figure, seems less an emotional imperative than a thematic one. 

         A case can be made that Velvet Goldmine isn't fully filled in, and that Haynes, who has never shaken off his background as a semiotics major, has made a movie that's all signifiers. I sometimes found myself wishing he would let the picture catch its breath, that the performers would stop coming at me in stroboscopic flashes. But then I'd be swept up in the sinuous motion of his filmmaking, in the elation of watching point of view passed like a baton from hand to hand, in the liberating force of his language and soundtrack. Velvet Goldmine might seem like a collection of baubles, but those baubles are strung. 

          Is Brad Pitt the worst actor on earth? The case could be made, and Meet Joe Black could serve as Exhibit A. Pitt plays two roles in this seven course schlockfest. He's (briefly) a slick but wholesome yuppie and then (interminably) Death, who takes over the young man's body when he's thumped by a couple of cars in the movie's most promising moment. Bleached so blond that he looks like an irradiated android, Pitt expels all expression from his face and all tone from his voice. He speaks very, very slowly. The stunt half-works, at least until he's supposed to undergo an inner transformation and acquire human emotions--whereupon his face remains just as blank. Pitt's conception of the role is an idée fixe by someone who doesn't appear to have an idée in his head. 

         Martin Brest, the director, is known for shooting a ton of footage and then ""finding"" his films in the editing room. What do you suppose he ""found"" when he scrutinized these miles of celluloid with Pitt doing nothing and taking his sweet time doing it? The first adaptation of this story (originally a play) was the 1934 Death Takes a Holiday , which came in at a perky 78 minutes. A conceit this fragile needs to whiz along to keep our disbelief in suspension, but Meet Joe Black grinds on for three hours (longer than either Beloved or Saving Private Ryan ), and Pitt acts as if he has leased the screen by the year. 

         Anthony Hopkins plays the zillionaire communications baron whom Death enlists in the hope of understanding the human condition--an odd choice for a tour guide, since most people's condition doesn't involve personal helicopters, sprawling mansions on Long Island Sound, or Manhattan apartments that sport Olympic-size swimming pools. Four screenwriters, among them the great Bo Goldman ( Melvin and Howard , 1980; Shoot the Moon , 1982), labored on this moldy script, which features characters who ask questions that begin ""Am I to understand that ...?"" and a corporate villain who directs another character to ""wake up and smell the thorns."" It apparently never occurred to even one of these overpaid scribes to eliminate Hopkins' rueful realization that he'd ""never write the great American novel""--no kidding, given his flagrantly Welsh accent. 

         Actually, Hopkins gives this humanistic magnate considerable weight, so that whether or not Death takes him before he can stop to smell the roses and make amends to his neglected children becomes a matter of some suspense. The rest of the cast works with equal fortitude, especially Jeffrey Tambor (Hank ""Hey now!"" Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show ) as Hopkins' milksop son-in-law and Marcia Gay Harden as his party planning, perpetually wilting elder daughter. As the younger daughter, the dark eyed, spaghetti thin Claire Forlani has to carry the picture's bathos on her exquisite shoulders. Her tremulous thoroughbred act wears thin, but it's hardly her fault: She has to emote like mad opposite a black pit of death--or is that the Black Death of Pitt?

                         Elizabeth is a lurid paraphrase of the old Groucho Marx line about Doris Day: ""I knew the Virgin Queen before she was a virgin."" As the movie tells it, she was a sylvan, redheaded princess (Cate Blanchett) given to gamboling with her fella (Joseph Fiennes) between periods of internment in the Tower of London on charges of conspiring to overthrow her half-sister, the heatedly Catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke). The daughter of the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and therefore dubbed a bastard by the papists, the Protestant Elizabeth ascends the throne to find the air still thick with smoke from roasted heretics, a team of skulking Catholics plotting her assassination, and a council of advisers (lords, bishops, sundry old boys) who snigger openly at the prospect of taking orders from a woman. Only a strategic marriage to a Spaniard or a Frenchman will mollify all factions, her advisers insist, but the pickings prove dismal. (Her French suitor enjoys wearing dresses.) After skulls are smashed, throats slit, and bosoms skewered in the name of Christ, Elizabeth decides to: a) ""unsex"" herself and become a symbol--the Virgin Queen, married only to England; and b) entertain dissenting opinions exclusively from those whose heads are affixed to spikes. 

         You can't be both a queenly queen and a womanly woman, says the script (by Michael Hirst)--at least not in 1554. (The director, Shekhar Kapur, made the same point in his grim 1994 Indian epic The Bandit Queen , against a backdrop of scrubby plains along the Ganges.) Is this feminist take historically accurate? Probably, although the evidence suggests that Elizabeth had developed a head for stratagems earlier in life (her position had been precarious since the beheading of her mother) and came to the throne with few girlish illusions about How Things Work in a barbarous state. 

         That said, the movie's approach makes for juicy melodrama. The tone of Elizabeth comes nearer to the nihilistic relish of Jacobeans such as John Ford and John Webster than to the more sorrowful horror of the Elizabethan dramatists Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare. It's even closer to a Jacobean drama of our own age: The Godfather (1972), which it emulates by cutting back-and-forth between queen and courtiers in prayer and the roundup and slaughter of Catholics on their privies, in bed with their mistresses, and so on. Their severed heads look on, wide-eyed, as Elizabeth directs her hair to be shorn--images of her girlhood flashing by as her locks rain down--and then walks weightily to her throne, now a chalk-faced gorgon. 

         With all due respect to Blanchett, Bette Davis, and Glenda Jackson, my favorite Elizabeth I remains Miranda Richardson's capricious, baby-talking psychopath on the BBC comedy Blackadder II . (Casting about for a new lord high executioner, she mews to Rowan Atkinson, ""There are thousands of Catholics simply dying to have their heads sneaked off --and there's no one to organize it."") But Blanchett comes in a close second, pulling off the transition from hapless young woman to coolly ruthless monarch with uncommon subtlety. Gradually expunging all empathy from her moist, pink eyes and permitting her visage to ossify, she gives this carnival of carnage an awe-inspiring center. 

          A more subversive sort of queen is on display in Velvet Goldmine , Todd Haynes' musical fantasia on the early '70s era of ""glam"" or ""glitter"" rock. Here the monarch is a David Bowie-esque singer called Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his spidery, space-age alter ego, Maxwell Demon. The movie opens with a spaceship depositing an infant Oscar Wilde on the stoop of a Dublin townhouse. Then it skips ahead to track a jade pin (it signifies hedonistic liberation) from the custody of a young Wilde to a swishy fringe creature called Jack Fairy to the regal Slade, a bisexual superstar who carries the news to all the young dudes. After that, we're in an Orwellian 1984 that's presided over by a vaguely fascist president and by arena rockers who serve as propagandists for a repressively conformist state. Whatever happened to Brian Slade, the glitter kids, the visionary exhibitionists and gleeful poseurs? Borrowing its framework from Citizen Kane , the movie follows a reporter (Christian Bale) assigned to reconstruct Slade's life and solve the mystery of his whereabouts. 

         Whatever you make of Velvet Goldmine (opinions have ranged from rapturous to casually dismissive), it's like no other musical ever made. It's determinedly swirling, discursive, elliptical. Now the story is told by an omniscient narrator, now a TV reporter, now a participant. Now it's flashing back, now forward. Every other line of dialogue is a cue for one of its dazzling numbers, largely covers of songs by Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, and T. Rex. The narrative is a challenge to keep up with, but then, great artists often invent their own syntax. In the '80s, Haynes employed Barbie dolls to depict the rise and wasting away from anorexia of the singer Karen Carpenter. Lucky audiences who caught Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (it was shelved when Richard Carpenter served the producers with an order to cease and desist exhibition) began by laughing at this elaborately posed, soft-rock femme, only to discover by the climax that the cultural forces that were eating at her (and that kept her from eating) had grown heartbreakingly palpable. Poison (1991), Haynes' Genêt-inspired exploration of transgression, didn't overcome its own artiness. But Safe (1995), the story of a Reagan-era housewife (Julianne Moore) convinced that her environment is poisoning her, is an entrancing meditation on the power of culture to crush the individual. Despite its ironic detachment, the film draws you into its heroine's sickly state: Breathing oxygen from a canister inside a high-tech igloo, she dwindles to nearly nothing, the modern incarnation of the Incredible Shrinking Man. 

         (It was partly my passion for Haynes' films that led me to accept a job offer from his indefatigable producer Christine Vachon last year to collaborate on a nuts-and-bolts book about producing, Shooting To Kill . So my review of Velvet Goldmine --like my review of Vachon's other recent release, Happiness --should be read as the work of a partisan. But not a blind partisan.) 

         In Velvet Goldmine , Haynes sets out to demonstrate the power of popular music to change people's lives--to tell them it's OK to fashion themselves into anything they please. The core of the movie turns out not to be the Bowie figure but the journalist, Arthur Stuart, who was a witness to the events he's now reconstructing. Bale is such an expressive performer that Stuart's remembrance of things past attains a Proustian intensity. To him, Slade was a sexual messiah. I've never seen a more vivid distillation of rock's allure than the scene in which he reverently opens the new Brian Slade album--its centerfold image is a lithe, naked, green-tinged Maxwell Demon--slips the vinyl out of its paper jacket and, after gingerly setting the LP on the turntable, props a chair under the doorknob to keep the uncomprehending world at bay. 

         But if Haynes wants Velvet Goldmine to be an anthem to the principles Bowie once embodied--the embrace of artifice and the smashing of conventional sexual roles--he also wants to portray the rocker as a hollow opportunist who abandoned glam and bisexuality for the life of a corporate superstar, throwing in his lot with the forces of repression. That's a lot to cover. An actor of stature might have bridged these two impulses, but the beautiful, brazenly slim-hipped Rhys-Meyers doesn't make his lines sound as if he's thinking them up on the spot, and Slade's self-destructive passion for Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), the film's fuzzy, sweet Iggy Pop figure, seems less an emotional imperative than a thematic one. 

         A case can be made that Velvet Goldmine isn't fully filled in, and that Haynes, who has never shaken off his background as a semiotics major, has made a movie that's all signifiers. I sometimes found myself wishing he would let the picture catch its breath, that the performers would stop coming at me in stroboscopic flashes. But then I'd be swept up in the sinuous motion of his filmmaking, in the elation of watching point of view passed like a baton from hand to hand, in the liberating force of his language and soundtrack. Velvet Goldmine might seem like a collection of baubles, but those baubles are strung. 

          Is Brad Pitt the worst actor on earth? The case could be made, and Meet Joe Black could serve as Exhibit A. Pitt plays two roles in this seven course schlockfest. He's (briefly) a slick but wholesome yuppie and then (interminably) Death, who takes over the young man's body when he's thumped by a couple of cars in the movie's most promising moment. Bleached so blond that he looks like an irradiated android, Pitt expels all expression from his face and all tone from his voice. He speaks very, very slowly. The stunt half-works, at least until he's supposed to undergo an inner transformation and acquire human emotions--whereupon his face remains just as blank. Pitt's conception of the role is an idée fixe by someone who doesn't appear to have an idée in his head. 

         Martin Brest, the director, is known for shooting a ton of footage and then ""finding"" his films in the editing room. What do you suppose he ""found"" when he scrutinized these miles of celluloid with Pitt doing nothing and taking his sweet time doing it? The first adaptation of this story (originally a play) was the 1934 Death Takes a Holiday , which came in at a perky 78 minutes. A conceit this fragile needs to whiz along to keep our disbelief in suspension, but Meet Joe Black grinds on for three hours (longer than either Beloved or Saving Private Ryan ), and Pitt acts as if he has leased the screen by the year. 

         Anthony Hopkins plays the zillionaire communications baron whom Death enlists in the hope of understanding the human condition--an odd choice for a tour guide, since most people's condition doesn't involve personal helicopters, sprawling mansions on Long Island Sound, or Manhattan apartments that sport Olympic-size swimming pools. Four screenwriters, among them the great Bo Goldman ( Melvin and Howard , 1980; Shoot the Moon , 1982), labored on this moldy script, which features characters who ask questions that begin ""Am I to understand that ...?"" and a corporate villain who directs another character to ""wake up and smell the thorns."" It apparently never occurred to even one of these overpaid scribes to eliminate Hopkins' rueful realization that he'd ""never write the great American novel""--no kidding, given his flagrantly Welsh accent. 

         Actually, Hopkins gives this humanistic magnate considerable weight, so that whether or not Death takes him before he can stop to smell the roses and make amends to his neglected children becomes a matter of some suspense. The rest of the cast works with equal fortitude, especially Jeffrey Tambor (Hank ""Hey now!""

16,"Dole vs. the
Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind. It's true that coverage of Clinton on the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole, as even other Times reporters acknowledge. But the explanation is institutional, not ideological. The press, as many have complained, overemphasizes the ""horse race"" aspect of politics. As a side effect of that disease, reporters have excessive respect for a well-run campaign. (In 1988, Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon.) A cruder reality is that reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday. 

         None of these factors, though, is unique to the Times . So why is Dole singling it out? Dole's attacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise in populist demagogy. In one of his great cue-card reading remarks, Dole tried to explain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying, ""I like the media. They don't like them in the South."" But this pat explanation doesn't entirely make sense. Red meat for right-wing crowds doesn't help Dole with the centrist voters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen. And in fact, according to a senior Dole aide, the attacks are heartfelt on the candidate's part. Dole has been going after the Times over the objections of advisers who have been telling him there's no percentage in picking fights with the press. 

         But if Dole is attacking the Times because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will help him get elected, what is he so angry about? The answer, I think, is that there has always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole, by which I mean a part of him which feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment. At the Republican convention, Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a ""corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned."" That phrase recalled an attack he made on the press long ago, in the days of Watergate, when he accused the Washington Post of being in bed with George McGovern. ""There is a cultural and social affinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editors,"" Dole said then. ""They belong to the same elite: They can be found living cheek-by-jowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods, and hob-nobbing at the same Georgetown parties."" The deeper story here isn't whether Dole was wrongly shunted onto D19 when he ought to have been on A1. It's his feelings, as he says goodbye to politics, about the people who get to decide.

Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind.

This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind. It's true that coverage of Clinton on the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole, as even other Times reporters acknowledge. But the explanation is institutional, not ideological. The press, as many have complained, overemphasizes the ""horse race"" aspect of politics. As a side effect of that disease, reporters have excessive respect for a well-run campaign. (In 1988, Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon.) A cruder reality is that reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday. 

         None of these factors, though, is unique to the Times . So why is Dole singling it out? Dole's attacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise in populist demagogy. In one of his great cue-card reading remarks, Dole tried to explain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying, ""I like the media. They don't like them in the South."" But this pat explanation doesn't entirely make sense. Red meat for right-wing crowds doesn't help Dole with the centrist voters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen. And in fact, according to a senior Dole aide, the attacks are heartfelt on the candidate's part. Dole has been going after the Times over the objections of advisers who have been telling him there's no percentage in picking fights with the press. 

         But if Dole is attacking the Times because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will help him get elected, what is he so angry about? The answer, I think, is that there has always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole, by which I mean a part of him which feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment. At the Republican convention, Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a ""corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned."" That phrase recalled an attack he made on the press long ago, in the days of Watergate, when he accused the Washington Post of being in bed with George McGovern. ""There is a cultural and social affinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editors,"" Dole said then. ""They belong to the same elite: They can be found living cheek-by-jowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods, and hob-nobbing at the same Georgetown parties."" The deeper story here isn't whether Dole was wrongly shunted onto D19 when he ought to have been on A1. It's his feelings, as he says goodbye to politics, about the people who get to decide.

16,"Dole vs. the
Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats.

         This week, soft-porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion models on the Internet. His site, ronsangels.com (named after the 1970s' babe show Charlie's Angels ), invites visitors to ""bid on eggs from beautiful, healthy and intelligent women."" Like Dr. Richard Seed, who recently declared his intention to clone human beings, Harris has attracted the attention of the media and politicians who are ""looking into"" whether he can be stopped. Most people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage. What they don't agree on is why. Here's what the critics have to say about the auction--and each other. 

          

            1. Egg auctions will produce designer babies. Harris cites his experience as a horse breeder and asks, ""We bid for everything else in this society--why not eggs?"" Alarmists, agreeing that Harris ""can put you into your own designer baby by selling eggs,"" predict that his success will steer ""the future of human breeding"" toward ""genetic engineering."" 

          

            2. Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies. While fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds, fertility experts simultaneously debunk that scenario. ""Not only is it ethically ludicrous, but the fact is, no kid's going to look like the model's picture,"" observes ethicist George Annas. The experts give four reasons. First, the child of an ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty. Second, everyone carries ""recessive"" genes, which are invisible in this generation but may become visible in the next. A model with a small nose can pass on genes for a big nose. Third, even if both parents are attractive, a child can combine their features unattractively. For example, a girl can inherit her mother's weak nose and her father's strong brow. 

          

            3. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest. Doomsayers predict that once ""beautiful eggs are available strictly to people who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them,"" the rich will transform themselves into a ""super-race"" reminiscent of the Nazis. To this, Harris replies, ""It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of only beautiful people. This site simply mirrors our current society, in that beauty usually goes to the highest bidder."" But this reply only fuels concern that gradually, society will separate into ""genetic haves and have nots."" 

          

            4. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest. Harris writes that only men with ""substantial financial resources"" are fit to give his models' offspring ""a financially secure and stable life."" But skeptics wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder--and men who buy these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good-looking children--may produce children just as dysfunctional as themselves. As Calgary Sun columnist Sydney Sharpe put it, ""Any woman ... who enters into this mephistophelian pact has a few screws loose. Maybe her kid will, too. Not to mention the buyers who sign her up."" 

          

            5. Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the unfittest. Many models, if not most, have had cosmetic surgery. A model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs. (One of Harris' ""angels"" has already been caught lying about her age.) How does Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs? ""There's no way to know that. You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the truth,"" he says. Annas concludes that since there's ""no way to know how much of their beauty is a product of their genes, plastic surgery, a makeup artist, or exercise,"" only a ""naive"" person would buy their eggs on the basis of the photographs displayed on the site. ""You don't want to see the models,"" he points out. ""You want to see pictures of their parents."" On this theory, children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on one side and fools on the other. 

          

            6. Beauty doesn't convey health. Harris casually asserts that beauty ""shows healthiness and longevity."" On his site, he writes, "" 'Natural Selection' is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful."" Skeptics question this assumed equivalence, noting that traits men find attractive in women these days--thinness, for example--are often unhealthy. When asked on the Today show how much ""medical screening"" he has given his egg donors, Harris answered, ""None."" 

          

            7. Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence. Harris says he's not the first person to market good genes. Others, he notes, have sold sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor's intelligence. Harris' detractors reply that beauty is ""superficial"" and conveys a ""harmful preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of character."" This critique is usually offered by a blow-dried TV interviewer who, after thanking Harris for his time, urges viewers to stay tuned for the movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break. 

          

            8. Beauty is less useful than intelligence. Harris advertises beauty not as an end but as a means to ""success,"" since people who are physically desirable get more attention, power, and favorable treatment. Having chided Harris for exalting social advantage over ""character,"" critics turn around and adopt his ruthless logic. While conceding that beauty is useful, they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today's meritocratic information economy--and that although Harris claims his models are ""beautiful, healthy and intelligent,"" he offers no evidence of brains, such as IQ or SAT scores. London's Independent envisions ""Bimbo births."" A fertility expert shrugs, ""If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them."" 

          

            9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure capitalism, saying it's ""unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make money"" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of ""taking advantage of couples trying to conceive"" and exploiting ""desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell."" USA Today laments, ""This is about human need. And human greed."" 

          

            10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday, Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction. Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA Today described the models as ""struggling actresses,"" reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying, ""I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse ."" Harris' sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was ""better than prostitution."" 

         Harris constantly refers to the donors as his ""girls"" and describes them like cattle--""We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls."" He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures. ""We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items,"" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to ""find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on the Web."" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps like him have come away with the profit. 

          

            11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models), hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels.com is really aimed at ""adolescent boys."" 

          

            12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. ""Ever since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs,"" one fertility expert complains to the New York Times . USA Today says the egg auction ""just might force an Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the Internet taking us?"" 

          

            13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases. The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. ""When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,"" a computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that ""there's very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,"" and ""the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from."" 

          

            14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences. Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today show, Harris said of this theory, ""That's a pretty cynical view of human nature."") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples. 

          

            15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that ""having sex is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the next generation."" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words: ""our genes."" ""The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the [drive] to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site,"" Fisher observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself. 

          

            16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited. Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious response is to attack the whole ""prejudice"" in favor of beauty. ""The standards of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts, not really genetics facts,"" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, ""we should think about"" whether to ""accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them"" or to transcend those prejudices. 

         This critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start with the latter rather than the former? 

         Second, Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection. ""Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,"" he writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become more than material. At least, most of us have.

18,"Eleven-Twelfths of 1999 In Review 

         When Chatterbox invited readers to nominate events, significant deaths, good and bad movies, etc., for 1999--a year likely to get little attention in the coming weeks, as news organizations choose instead to review the entire century or millennium--the response was overwhelming. Chatterbox had promised to publish his official ""1999 In Review"" item before Thanksgiving, but some distant memory of a scruple persuaded him to wait till November was over. Nothing ever happens in December. 

         OK, that's not quite true. Hordes of protesters in Seattle are making the World Trade Organization's meeting there a much more exciting TV story than anyone expected it to be. Reader Dan Crist (who finds Chatterbox's habit of referring to himself in the third person ""rather annoying and less than professional"") points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941. Also, Chatterbox (moonlighting as ""Today's Papers"" columnist) observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representatives cast its second presidential-impeachment vote in U.S. history on Dec. 19, 1998. (That same news-filled day, the U.S. ended an air war against Iraq and Bob Livingston said he'd decided not to become House speaker after all.) Two months after the impeachment vote, the Senate failed to convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for some bizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrote in to remind him of it. 

         By now, it should be clear that Chatterbox isn't much good at year-in-review journalism. Fortunately, Chatterbox's readers are very good at it. He will now turn this survey over to them. 

         ( Disclaimer: Although Chatterbox previously stated that he wouldn't include opinions he disagreed with, that standard proved too confining. Where Chatterbox has solid information or opinions to the contrary, he occasionally interjects below. Obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour reader comments were discarded, but if you don't find your nominee below it doesn't necessarily mean that it was obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour. ) 

         Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999: 

         1. Most Hated Celebrity--Ever?              

          

                                The New York Times reported on Nov. 10, 1999, that a new record had been set in the latest Times /CBS poll: [Its] highest negative rating ever scored by a person in the news. The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump, who managed to make an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled. The paper noted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negative rating--the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp. Presumably this came as no surprise to Mr. Trump, who, upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee on Oct. 7, 1999, had cited polls with ""amazing results""--a remark that was widely misinterpreted at the time.                 

            -- Jodie Allen of U.S. News &amp; World Report (and frequent 

                  Slate                    contributor) 

          

         2. Most Foolishly Ignored Parts of the World in 1999              

          

                               The dog that did bark but no one noticed--the political turmoil in the three great South Asian nations of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which now are well on the way to passing the three northern Asian nations of China, Japan, and Russia in population (Indonesia is fourth, Pakistan just passed Japan to seventh, India will soon pass China to first). But Americans are still fixated on northern Asia--Clinton says he must deal with China, because ""you can't ignore a billion people with nuclear weapons,"" but his own policy toward India shows that you sure can!                 

            --Jim Chapin 

          

         3. Worst/Best Films of 1999              

          

                               Here's my nominee for worst movie of the year (complete category should be: ""Worst Movie of the Year That Assumedly Adult Male Reviewers Slathered Over""):                    There's Something About Mary                   --a pathetically sophomoric, penis-obsessed mess that wouldn't even appeal to Larry Flynt!                 

            -- Felicia, Menlo Park, Cal. 

          

                         Chatterbox replies:              

          

                               You've got the wrong year. That was 1998 .                                    

          

         [Chatterbox didn't have the heart to add that he thought There's Something About Mary was pretty funny, especially the joke about ""the franks or the beans.""] 

                                            Felicia replies:              

          

                               Oops ... well then, the best of '99 was                    The Red Violin                   --lyrical, magical, musical, wonderful!                 

          

         [Chatterbox hasn't seen it.] 

         4. Most Shameless (and Unsuccessful) Attempt To Have It Both Ways in 1999 : 

          

                               Sen. Arlen Specter, citing Scottish law, finds Clinton ""not proven"" on the impeachment charges.                 

            --Andrew Solovay

                         6. 1999: The Road Not Taken              

          

                                What an extraordinary year! A right-wing conspiracy topples the president, and the governor of Texas reveals himself in a series of debates to be a natural leader with an innate gift for connecting with his audience, a sure sign of his electoral success next year. A new Thomas Harris book brilliantly takes us deeper into the mind of a serial killer; a new Star Wars movie redefines the very nature of entertainment; a new Stanley Kubrick film changes the whole national dialogue about sex and marriage; a new TV series from the creator of SportsNight --oh, I can't even bring myself to bash that piece of do-gooder twaddle. If only McDonald's had come out with three more boldly adult-flavored hamburgers, it would have been a perfect year for dud megaevents--all leading up of course to Y2K, the limpest milestone in human history.

         7 . Children Behaving Badly in 1999              

          

                               Don't forget Woodstock 1999 --the concert of ""peace and love"" that ended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours-long tribute to the original Woodstock, the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else that would burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene. [ Chatterbox interjects: Didn't people get assaulted and raped, too?] I'm getting all sentimental just thinking about it.                 

            You also left out all the shooting rampages . Several were done in the name of God or love supposedly. They were all committed by ""quiet, shy"" people who ""mostly kept to"" themselves. I've started to hang around only loud, obnoxious people.                 

            --Susan Hoechstetter 

          

         8. A Lunatic Rhapsody for the                 New York Yankees              

          

                                The Yankees can actually be referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the 1999 World Series champions, they are a significant ""story of the year."" However, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader context.                 

            1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, by one, the most championships any one team won during the century. The Montreal Canadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team, playing in the ""City of the Century"" (so called by me to reflect the amazing growth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the ""National Pastime,"" are truly an amazing story. 

            The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25 of the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellence is not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win is possibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels of playoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, by winning three of the last four championships, they are the first team to accomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play. 

            The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, and Yogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport, and American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, and America's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature ""a name."" This team, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, and no star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax American interests, and the new political paradigm.

         9. A Big Shot Calls for Decriminalizing Drug Use in 1999              

          

                               New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition. Though this by itself has no immediate effect, it makes it respectable, for the first time, for political leaders to discuss the subject, and thereby brings closer the day when the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed, when billions of dollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people's lives, and when we will stop, as in Samuel Butler's                    Erewhon                   , imprisoning people for the crime of being sick.

                                I nominate as the most under-reported story of the year (and the last few years) the continuing alarmist predictions by foreign-policy and military experts about peacekeeping efforts, which are then proved wrong and immediately forgotten. This year, the obvious one is Kosovo, but the year is also ending with East Timor, where the Aussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with no casualties.                 

            These followed Haiti, Bosnia, and Rwanda as places where the West delayed sending in troops because of alarmist predictions.

                         Chatterbox interjects: Yes, but the evidence was shaky--something the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page, which broke the story, was not very forthcoming about. As Jack Shafer wrote in this column, Ronald Reagan, after he left office, was also accused of having once committed rape. The evidence there was shaky, too. 

         17. The Most Important Thing of All That Happened in 1999              

          

                               In 1999, more than half of U.S. homes had a PC, for the first time (i.e., home-PC penetration passed 50 percent). Of course, most of these PCs crashed all the time, but it's still a significant development. By the way, Internet hookups in homes are still well below 50 percent.

                               The Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , thereby decapitating nuclear-arms control and sending Iraq, Iran, and North Korea the message that the United States won't raise a big stink if they try to join India and Pakistan.

         Gambling's would-be federal regulators--the National Gambling Impact Study Commission--went to Las Vegas this week to hold hearings. In today's dispatch, we learn how gambling's foes seek to demonize wagering as a pernicious tobaccolike vice. In yesterday's dispatch, gambling's foes learn the folly of having brought their anti-sin crusade to an adult Disneyland. 

         Tuesday's overpowering show of force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effect on the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Wednesday, even commission Chair Kay Coles James, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous Vegas euphemism: She begins referring to the ""gaming industry."" 

         After Tuesday's casino triumphalism, Wednesday is a comedown, eight hours of policy panels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gambling marketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for the first time I sense that this commission--though divided, underfunded, timid, and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It may finally settle this question: Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco? Entertainment or vice? 

         The sleek Vegas types, whose Strip palaces scramble casinos, theaters, restaurants, arcades, discos, cabarets, theme parks, concert halls, sports arenas, and museums into one giant orgy of amusement, have been selling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--Disney in the desert. This effort has largely succeeded, because Vegas is still the dominant image of American gambling, if not the dominant reality. 

         The antis, meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for kids, viciously addictive, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unless mightily regulated. 

          Judging by today's hearings and by conversations with most of the commissioners, the tobacco model is winning. Today's panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble too young and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears to be increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed to addict customers, and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowing them to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors. The testimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impress the three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June 1999 report. 

         It is starting to become clear what that report will say. The commission won't (and can't) take any grand stand against gambling. Instead it will opt for small, targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probably propose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research and that casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering. The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment of pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to cover gambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers' access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos to remove the machines from their floors. 

         The commission will also push the industry to do more to prevent kids from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of Indian gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling, perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It will rebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a tobaccolike vice. 

         If the comments of the pro-industry commissioners can be believed, the industry will happily endorse such a report. Gamblers don't quite accept the cigarette analogy--though commission member Bill Bible, a former chief of the Nevada Gaming Commission, did concede that gambling was like alcohol--but they're happy to sign on to the specific measures. The casino industry is even trying to get ahead of the commission. It has already established a (mostly) independent center to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect that the industry will not only agree to the commission's recommendations but will become their strongest advocate. Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress and state legislatures to enact the recommendations into law. 

          Why should the pro-gamblers cooperate with a critical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes the problem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality rather than industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is also politically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblers, the casinos will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of their customers than with profits. 

         The cigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the true reasons for worry. A few years ago, gambling was confined to Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It is now thriving in 48 states, and there is no sign that anyone can stop it. In this election, gambling interests dropped $100 million on a single California ballot initiative, toppled governors in two states, and bought senators and representatives by the crate. What the commission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. 

         The antis can call gambling ""tobacco."" They can call it ""vice."" They can call it ""a big red balloon"" for all that the industry cares. As long as the commission just nibbles around the edges, the casino operators and state lotteries will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling folks will win credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts. The last national gambling commission was in the mid-1970s. If the gamblers play along with this commission's timid recommendations, they'll be safe for another 20 years. 

                         An Apology              

         I owe an apology to Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, whom I criticized yesterday for using the term ""Indian country"" during a speech critical of Indian casinos. As several readers pointed out to me, ""Indian country"" is a common phrase in the West and has no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, Senator. 

         Talk about quick defeats: The first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that the National Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost. The sign reads: ""National Gaming Impact Study Commission."" 

                         ""Gaming""?              

         In Las Vegas, the euphemizers reign. Once upon a time, the casino owners decided that ""gambling"" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So ""gambling"" disappeared in Las Vegas, and ""gaming"" has risen in its place. He who controls language controls ideas, and at today's commission hearing, it is perfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed into convenience stores--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling there is--are called ""retail gaming."" People who own casinos are not ""casino owners,"" they are ""gaming visionaries."" Pathological gamblers are ""problem gamers""--as if they're having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly. And the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact Study Commission. 

         The gambling industry did everything in its power to stop the establishment of this commission two years ago, but Congress and a fervent grassroots anti-gambling group eventually foisted it on the industry. The nine member blue-ribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economic impact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to Congress and the president in June 1999. Even though the panel was carefully balanced between pro- and anti-gambling leaders, it was supposed to be Vegas' nemesis. The industry and Las Vegas' pro-gambling media quaked in anticipation of the onerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend. 

         But they quake no more. Whatever national momentum the anti-gamblers had dissolved in last week's elections. The industry routed opponents in state after state. Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos. Californians voted to expand Indian casinos. In South Carolina and Alabama, voters expelled anti-lottery, anti-gambling Republican governors and replaced them with pro-lottery Democrats. The gambling industry spent more than $100 million on political contributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or more secure. 

         ""My goodness, no politician can withstand their resources,"" Focus on the Family's James Dobson, the commission's leading gambling opponent, tells me. The industry's political clout has emasculated the commission, Dobson continues: ""Our report won't be acted on by the president or Congress. They are too heavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the leaders of Congress are on the dole."" It has also become obvious that the commission has too many pro-gambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other real penalties on the industry. 

          So the commission's two day visit to Gomorrah has been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lap for gaming. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and the ""gaming visionaries"" have been planning for these hearings for months, hoping to use them to demonstrate the might and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry. 

         The MGM Grand, which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni, is itself the first exhibit of the Vegas triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that consumers, at least, have no problem with this business. The MGM Grand, a k a ""The City of Entertainment,"" has 5,000 rooms--the corridor outside my room is 200 yards long, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines, craps tables, and roulette wheels. David Cassidy performs here every night--twice! A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelming evidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote. New York, New York is just across the street, the $1.6 billion Bellagio is one door down, and a half-scale Eiffel Tower is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling folks no doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling opponents. I asked one anti-gambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks of it. She could only blurt out ""Wow."" 

         The hearings, too, reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas theme. Frank Fahrenkopf, the industry's top lobbyist (who is paid so much he can afford monogrammed shirt cuffs --I saw them), holds forth cheerfully outside the ballroom, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom over religious moralist tyranny. Inside, the room is packed with more than 600 people in neon lime green T-shirts that read ""Unions and Gaming: Together for a Better Life."" They are members of the major casino union, here to cheer on their employers and their union. (Most of them, it must be said, are getting paid to do this.) 

         Chairwoman Kay Coles James, a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling, opens the hearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless: ""We're not here to take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except make recommendations."" This sets the mood for most of the day: Vegas is great, so you'd better leave it alone! The local government, by all appearances a wholly owned subsidiary of the casinos, puts on a bravura performance. Gov. Miller opens the show with a 15 minute hymn to Las Vegas. It is the first of many statistical barrages about Nevada's one-ders: No. 1 in job growth, No. 1 in population growth, and No. 1 on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scout troops--and Boy Scout troops! 

          Later in the day, Nevada's senators and both its congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevada might have a dark side. They pay tribute to Nevada's sophisticated gambling industry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling states) and its use of gambling taxes to fund state services. It is one of the ironies of Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen (Jim Gibbons and John Ensign) end up crediting their state's success to government regulation and corporate taxation. 

         There are also a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators, bookmakers, and casino employees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears from. Critics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils of convenience store slot machines leaven the pro-gambling folks. Everyone, including the gambling industry shills, agrees that Internet gambling is evil and should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas is making any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure they would explain why it's as American as nickel slots and scratch-off games. 

         Pro-Vegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots at Indian gambling, the chief economic threat to Nevada's prosperity. The expansion of Indian casinos resulting from last week's California voter initiative will slam Las Vegas, cutting its gambling revenues by $400 million a year. So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in ""Indian country"" (that's Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan's term--I'm not joking) for being insufficiently regulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this ""red baiting."" 

         (Pause for an aesthetic observation: I am sitting right behind the witnesses, and after a while I begin to separate them into the Wides and the Narrows. The Wides are men in suits with enormous backs and enormous bellies, men who eat and eat and used to play football. They all testify to their love of gambling. The Narrows are thin and generally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gambling correlates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, and decide that they probably do.) 

         During the last hour of the day, the public comment period, the union sends a parade of casino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry. Housekeepers, cooks, and slot change girls, almost all black or Latina, tell the same story: I was working a dead-end job in another state, ""then I heard about Las Vegas, where there's opportunity!"" I moved here, landed a job at a union casino with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and ""now I am buying a house."" The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasive tribute to the Strip that I've ever heard. 

          Still, for all the Vegan triumphalism in the air, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent, the Rev. Tom Grey. Grey is utterly irrepressible. A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodist minister, Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling. He founded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the primary force behind the commission's creation. (Grey, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat, has just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, tacitly recognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth and shameless promoter of the cause. He wears a gigantic ""CasiNO"" button in the casino. He posed for People in a shepherd's robe. He says ""I would do anything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stop gambling."" He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of an oncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies. 

         He and his Las Vegas allies, a former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venture capitalist named Otis Harris, invite me on a tour of Las Vegas. ""Behind the Mirage,"" they call it. For two hours, we cruise the streets behind the casinos. They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from a youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heels casinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about how terrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas' prosperity is. 

         It's very grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and pass the jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGM Grand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey's task is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wants to do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of the Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.

They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from a youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heels casinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about how terrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas' prosperity is. 

         It's very grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and pass the jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGM Grand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey's task is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wants to do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of the Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.

         This weekend's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, kicked off the 2000 presidential race and sorted out the Republican field. Everyone agrees that George W. Bush is the front-runner, that Steve Forbes is in second place, and that Dan Quayle, who finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander, will soon join Alexander on the sidelines. But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in third and fourth--Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer--and the one who skipped Ames, John McCain. For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race. 

                         Elizabeth Dole              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top three. Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press , Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had cracked ""the top three."" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames as a horse race (""win, place, and show"") and noting that ""no one's ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three"" at Ames. Newspapers, cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a ""solid third"" and a place among the leaders by crossing the ""double-digit"" threshold. As Fox News' Carl Cameron put it: ""The other seven candidates could not crack double digits."" 

          

            2. Race for third. Since Bush and Forbes were expected to finish first and second, many pundits concluded, as Lisa Myers put it on Meet the Press , that ""the real race here was for third. Elizabeth Dole won that."" The Boston Globe called Dole ""the winner of this contest-within-the-contest."" Dole touted her ""victory"" on every talk show and cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release. At a news conference, an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll's ""real winner."" 

          

            3. Underdog. In every TV interview, Dole claimed to have been ""outspent by millions of dollars."" Her spokesman told reporters that ""on a dollar-per-vote basis, Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve Forbes."" Reporters love an underdog. ""From a strict cost-benefit standpoint, the big winner may be Elizabeth Dole,"" concluded Time . 

          

            4. Comeback kid. Dismissive coverage of Dole before the straw poll played to her advantage, as everyone marveled at her ""surprisingly"" strong third. ""Dole Revived,"" the Washington Post 's front page proclaimed. On This Week , George Will conceded, ""There had been a lot of very skeptical stories about whether her people would show up. She, therefore, I think, is the biggest winner."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Race for second. Forbes wants to fast-forward the GOP tournament to a finals bracket: Bush vs. Forbes. To prevent this, Dole needs to create a semifinal playoff--Forbes vs. Dole--to determine who gets to play Bush. Despite Forbes' huge financial advantage, ""we finished close to second,"" Dole told reporters Saturday night. ""This is going to become a two-person race."" The press agreed. ""Forbes had growing hopes ... that he might upset Bush or finish a close second,"" recalled the Post . Instead, ""he finished closer to Dole than to Bush."" 

          

            2. Experience. Having narrowed the field to three, Dole needs to focus the contest on criteria that favor her. The first of these is political experience, of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none. On every talk show, Dole vowed ""to demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money. ... We're talking about president of the United States."" 

          

            3. Gender. This is the more obvious criterion that distinguishes Dole. She hardly needs to mention it--the media bring it up anyway--but she invokes it subtly, alluding (as she did on two Sunday talk shows) to ""women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake my hand, a woman they dare to believe in."" Newspapers hail Dole's female followers as evidence ""that she can attract new voters to the GOP."" 

                         Gary Bauer              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top four. Like Dole, Bauer needed to crack the top tier and seal off the pack. Since sports analogies tend to cut off the top tier at three rather than four (e.g., ""bronze medal,"" ""win, place, and show""), Bauer changed metaphors, telling reporters that he had reached ""the first rung of candidates"" and that lower finishers might soon perish. On Meet the Press , he called himself the ""breakout candidate."" While some pundits lumped Bauer with the winners, others offered him the next best position--""leading the rest of the pack""--or at least distinguished him from the ""losers."" 

          

            2. Social conservative quarterfinal. This was Bauer's big spin win. Like Dole, he won a crucial ""contest-within-the-contest."" His scant margin over Pat Buchanan--8.9 percent to 7.3 percent--became a huge factor in the post-poll analysis. Pundits concluded that Bauer ""did what he had to do ... beat Pat Buchanan,"" and therefore ""can legitimately say he is the candidate of the Christian right,"" establishing himself as ""one of the winners,"" the ""three or four"" candidates who ""got their tickets punched"" to stay in the race. Talk show hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whether Buchanan was finished. 

          

            3. Conservative semifinal. Having scored well ahead of Bauer and Buchanan, Forbes anointed himself ""the conservative in a two-man race"" against Bush. Bauer disagreed, and the media took his side. ""Forbes, Bauer Battle for Right,"" the Post proclaimed, concluding that because Forbes failed to break away, ""he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and tough fight for the leadership of the conservative wing."" 

          

            4. Underdog. Bauer couldn't claim to be more strapped than Dole, so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognition, inexperience, and working-class heritage. ""I am running against some big bios ... the son of a former president, the son of a tycoon, and the wife of a senator,"" Bauer argued on Late Edition . ""I have never run for president or office before. And yet here we come in fourth place."" Newsweek 's David Brooks wrote that Bauer ""overcame his own financial disadvantages"" and joined Dole as the two surviving ""Have-Not candidates."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Buchanan will defect. Since Buchanan's combativeness and loyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate, his rivals have persuaded the media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his low score at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party. The more Buchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism, the more he plays into this scenario. 

          

            2. Populism. With Buchanan out of the way, Bauer will go after Forbes. When asked on television about Forbes' claim to represent the right. Bauer cited Forbes' wealth and called himself ""the son of a maintenance man."" On This Week , George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer ""is becoming the populist in the race,"" noting that Bauer's supporters ""love the fact that he was the son of a janitor."" 

          

            3. Conservatism. If Bauer wins the social conservative quarterfinal and the conservative semifinal, he gets to run as the ""Reagan"" candidate against ""Bush-Gore"" moderation on abortion, Hollywood, China, and other hot-button issues. This bracket-by-bracket tournament strategy reduces Bauer's obstacles from three candidates to two. He can target Forbes, knowing that if he prevails, either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in the moderate semifinal. Indeed, Dole's success at Ames arguably helps Bauer by giving Bush a semifinal contest. 

                         John McCain              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Ames meant nothing to him. Despite having skipped the straw poll, McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday to discuss it. ""If you're going to be taken seriously,"" Brit Hume asked him, ""don't you have to face up to the fact, when all the other candidates decide that an event is worth attending ... that maybe you've got to play too?"" In reply, McCain repeatedly called Ames ""meaningless."" His chutzpah bowled over the pundits. Stephanopoulos called McCain's no-show ""a pretty smart move"" and portrayed the 83 votes he won in the straw poll--putting him in last place among active Republican candidates--as evidence of his strength. 

          

            2. Ames meant death for others. Noting that McCain had bypassed the event, Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he, too, ""almost took a pass on this. It wasn't until George Bush said he was going to participate that then I said, 'OK, we've got to do it,' out of respect to the Iowa Republican Party."" The result, Quayle pleaded, was that he lost to candidates who had been in Iowa ""years and months."" McCain, explaining his decision to stay out, espoused a less sentimental philosophy: ""You always want to fight on ground that is most favorable to you."" For this, the media executed Quayle and spared McCain. ""Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone, but I think McCain is still in,"" concluded NPR's Mara Liasson. Ames was Vietnam in reverse: McCain ducked the fight, and Quayle took the beating. 

          

            3. Viability. ""Once the dust has settled from the straw poll,"" McCain regally announced, ""I will review the new political landscape"" and begin ""engaging the other Republican candidates."" Why does McCain get a bye? Because he has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire later. Newsweek , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , and several TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable, wasn't hurt by Ames, and may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush. 

          

            4. Vote-buying. To undermine the straw poll's authority as an arbiter of his candidacy, McCain called it a ""fund-raiser,"" ""a sham and a joke"" in which campaigns spent ""millions"" to ""buy"" votes. ""My campaign theme is to try to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence of special interests,"" he argued on Fox News Sunday . Brit Hume's retort--""that this whole process isn't quite pure enough for you""--played right into McCain's hands. McCain doesn't need to persuade the media that his reasons for skipping Ames were morally sound. He just needs to persuade them that his reasons were moral rather than political. 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Real votes. The vote-buying complaint only gets McCain a bye on the straw poll. To get another bye on February's Iowa caucuses, he'll rely on two other moral arguments. First, he'll claim that caucuses aren't ""real votes."" ""We'll have real votes in New Hampshire,"" McCain argued on Fox News Sunday . ""That's where real people are motivated to vote."" On Face the Nation , he suggested that he would focus on ""the genuine balloting process, which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina."" 

          

            2. Ethanol. Many pundits, fancying themselves shrewd, suggest that McCain's true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has ""taken a position on ethanol subsidies that's unpalatable to voters in Iowa."" On This Week , Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might ""have to do something dramatic,"" such as ""make a stand and say, 'We're not going to compete in Iowa. We think these ethanol subsidies are an abomination.' "" This is McCain's greatest triumph: He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculations and accusing him instead of principle. ""I've taken a lot of unpopular positions,"" he conceded on Fox News Sunday . 

          

            3. Experience. The longer McCain stays out of the race without damaging his credibility, the more the field narrows to his advantage. Alexander and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, are already gone. Quayle and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, won't be far behind. If the field dwindles to Bush, Forbes, and Bauer, McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder running against Bush. But Dole's third-place finish at Ames, coupled with her victory in the post-Ames spin contest, complicates this plan. 

         So here's how the race shapes up. Bauer will frame it as a populist showdown, chiefly between himself and Forbes. Forbes will frame it as a fight between the establishment, led by Bush, and conservatives, led by himself. Dole will exploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes, pitching herself as the candidate of change, civility, and moral renewal. And McCain will fortify his war chest while his rivals battle and bleed. Ames has organized the contestants. Let the games begin.

For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race. 

                         Elizabeth Dole              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top three. Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press , Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had cracked ""the top three."" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames as a horse race (""win, place, and show"") and noting that ""no one's ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three"" at Ames. Newspapers, cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a ""solid third"" and a place among the leaders by crossing the ""double-digit"" threshold. As Fox News' Carl Cameron put it: ""The other seven candidates could not crack double digits."" 

          

            2. Race for third. Since Bush and Forbes were expected to finish first and second, many pundits concluded, as Lisa Myers put it on Meet the Press , that ""the real race here was for third. Elizabeth Dole won that."" The Boston Globe called Dole ""the winner of this contest-within-the-contest."" Dole touted her ""victory"" on every talk show and cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release. At a news conference, an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll's ""real winner."" 

          

            3. Underdog. In every TV interview, Dole claimed to have been ""outspent by millions of dollars."" Her spokesman told reporters that ""on a dollar-per-vote basis, Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve Forbes."" Reporters love an underdog. ""From a strict cost-benefit standpoint, the big winner may be Elizabeth Dole,"" concluded Time . 

          

            4. Comeback kid. Dismissive coverage of Dole before the straw poll played to her advantage, as everyone marveled at her ""surprisingly"" strong third. ""Dole Revived,"" the Washington Post 's front page proclaimed. On This Week , George Will conceded, ""There had been a lot of very skeptical stories about whether her people would show up. She, therefore, I think, is the biggest winner."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Race for second. Forbes wants to fast-forward the GOP tournament to a finals bracket: Bush vs. Forbes. To prevent this, Dole needs to create a semifinal playoff--Forbes vs. Dole--to determine who gets to play Bush. Despite Forbes' huge financial advantage, ""we finished close to second,"" Dole told reporters Saturday night. ""This is going to become a two-person race."" The press agreed. ""Forbes had growing hopes ... that he might upset Bush or finish a close second,"" recalled the Post . Instead, ""he finished closer to Dole than to Bush."" 

          

            2. Experience. Having narrowed the field to three, Dole needs to focus the contest on criteria that favor her. The first of these is political experience, of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none. On every talk show, Dole vowed ""to demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money. ... We're talking about president of the United States."" 

          

            3. Gender. This is the more obvious criterion that distinguishes Dole. She hardly needs to mention it--the media bring it up anyway--but she invokes it subtly, alluding (as she did on two Sunday talk shows) to ""women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake my hand, a woman they dare to believe in."" Newspapers hail Dole's female followers as evidence ""that she can attract new voters to the GOP."" 

                         Gary Bauer              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top four. Like Dole, Bauer needed to crack the top tier and seal off the pack. Since sports analogies tend to cut off the top tier at three rather than four (e.g., ""bronze medal,"" ""win, place, and show""), Bauer changed metaphors, telling reporters that he had reached ""the first rung of candidates"" and that lower finishers might soon perish. On Meet the Press , he called himself the ""breakout candidate."" While some pundits lumped Bauer with the winners, others offered him the next best position--""leading the rest of the pack""--or at least distinguished him from the ""losers."" 

          

            2. Social conservative quarterfinal. This was Bauer's big spin win. Like Dole, he won a crucial ""contest-within-the-contest."" His scant margin over Pat Buchanan--8.9 percent to 7.3 percent--became a huge factor in the post-poll analysis. Pundits concluded that Bauer ""did what he had to do ... beat Pat Buchanan,"" and therefore ""can legitimately say he is the candidate of the Christian right,"" establishing himself as ""one of the winners,"" the ""three or four"" candidates who ""got their tickets punched"" to stay in the race. Talk show hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whether Buchanan was finished. 

          

            3. Conservative semifinal. Having scored well ahead of Bauer and Buchanan, Forbes anointed himself ""the conservative in a two-man race"" against Bush. Bauer disagreed, and the media took his side. ""Forbes, Bauer Battle for Right,"" the Post proclaimed, concluding that because Forbes failed to break away, ""he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and tough fight for the leadership of the conservative wing."" 

          

            4. Underdog. Bauer couldn't claim to be more strapped than Dole, so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognition, inexperience, and working-class heritage. ""I am running against some big bios ... the son of a former president, the son of a tycoon, and the wife of a senator,"" Bauer argued on Late Edition . ""I have never run for president or office before. And yet here we come in fourth place."" Newsweek 's David Brooks wrote that Bauer ""overcame his own financial disadvantages"" and joined Dole as the two surviving ""Have-Not candidates."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Buchanan will defect. Since Buchanan's combativeness and loyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate, his rivals have persuaded the media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his low score at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party. The more Buchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism, the more he plays into this scenario. 

          

            2. Populism. With Buchanan out of the way, Bauer will go after Forbes. When asked on television about Forbes' claim to represent the right. Bauer cited Forbes' wealth and called himself ""the son of a maintenance man."" On This Week , George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer ""is becoming the populist in the race,"" noting that Bauer's supporters ""love the fact that he was the son of a janitor."" 

          

            3. Conservatism. If Bauer wins the social conservative quarterfinal and the conservative semifinal, he gets to run as the ""Reagan"" candidate against ""Bush-Gore"" moderation on abortion, Hollywood, China, and other hot-button issues. This bracket-by-bracket tournament strategy reduces Bauer's obstacles from three candidates to two. He can target Forbes, knowing that if he prevails, either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in the moderate semifinal. Indeed, Dole's success at Ames arguably helps Bauer by giving Bush a semifinal contest. 

                         John McCain              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Ames meant nothing to him. Despite having skipped the straw poll, McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday to discuss it. ""If you're going to be taken seriously,"" Brit Hume asked him, ""don't you have to face up to the fact, when all the other candidates decide that an event is worth attending ... that maybe you've got to play too?"" In reply, McCain repeatedly called Ames ""meaningless."" His chutzpah bowled over the pundits. Stephanopoulos called McCain's no-show ""a pretty smart move"" and portrayed the 83 votes he won in the straw poll--putting him in last place among active Republican candidates--as evidence of his strength. 

          

            2. Ames meant death for others. Noting that McCain had bypassed the event, Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he, too, ""almost took a pass on this. It wasn't until George Bush said he was going to participate that then I said, 'OK, we've got to do it,' out of respect to the Iowa Republican Party."" The result, Quayle pleaded, was that he lost to candidates who had been in Iowa ""years and months."" McCain, explaining his decision to stay out, espoused a less sentimental philosophy: ""You always want to fight on ground that is most favorable to you."" For this, the media executed Quayle and spared McCain. ""Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone, but I think McCain is still in,"" concluded NPR's Mara Liasson. Ames was Vietnam in reverse: McCain ducked the fight, and Quayle took the beating. 

          

            3. Viability. ""Once the dust has settled from the straw poll,"" McCain regally announced, ""I will review the new political landscape"" and begin ""engaging the other Republican candidates."" Why does McCain get a bye? Because he has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire later. Newsweek , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , and several TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable, wasn't hurt by Ames, and may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush. 

          

            4. Vote-buying. To undermine the straw poll's authority as an arbiter of his candidacy, McCain called it a ""fund-raiser,"" ""a sham and a joke"" in which campaigns spent ""millions"" to ""buy"" votes. ""My campaign theme is to try to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence of special interests,"" he argued on Fox News Sunday . Brit Hume's retort--""that this whole process isn't quite pure enough for you""--played right into McCain's hands. McCain doesn't need to persuade the media that his reasons for skipping Ames were morally sound. He just needs to persuade them that his reasons were moral rather than political. 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Real votes. The vote-buying complaint only gets McCain a bye on the straw poll. To get another bye on February's Iowa caucuses, he'll rely on two other moral arguments. First, he'll claim that caucuses aren't ""real votes."" ""We'll have real votes in New Hampshire,"" McCain argued on Fox News Sunday . ""That's where real people are motivated to vote."" On Face the Nation , he suggested that he would focus on ""the genuine balloting process, which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina."" 

          

            2. Ethanol. Many pundits, fancying themselves shrewd, suggest that McCain's true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has ""taken a position on ethanol subsidies that's unpalatable to voters in Iowa."" On This Week , Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might ""have to do something dramatic,"" such as ""make a stand and say, 'We're not going to compete in Iowa. We think these ethanol subsidies are an abomination.' "" This is McCain's greatest triumph: He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculations and accusing him instead of principle. ""I've taken a lot of unpopular positions,"" he conceded on Fox News Sunday . 

          

            3. Experience. The longer McCain stays out of the race without damaging his credibility, the more the field narrows to his advantage. Alexander and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, are already gone. Quayle and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, won't be far behind. If the field dwindles to Bush, Forbes, and Bauer, McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder running against Bush. But Dole's third-place finish at Ames, coupled with her victory in the post-Ames spin contest, complicates this plan. 

         So here's how the race shapes up. Bauer will frame it as a populist showdown, chiefly between himself and Forbes. Forbes will frame it as a fight between the establishment, led by Bush, and conservatives, led by himself. Dole will exploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes, pitching herself as the candidate of change, civility, and moral renewal. And McCain will fortify his war chest while his rivals battle and bleed. Ames has organized the contestants. Let the games begin.

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .) 

          

                         2.                 Philosophy. The first round of testing was All Lager. This second round was All Fancy, and Mainly Not Lager. As several correspondents (for instance, the of Best American Beers ) have helpfully pointed out, the definition of lager provided last time was not exactly ""accurate."" If you want to stay within the realm of textbook definitions, a lager is a beer brewed a particular way--slowly, at cool temperatures, with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat. This is in contrast with an ale, which is brewed faster, warmer, and with the yeast on top. By this same reasoning, lagers don't have to be light-colored, weak-flavored, and watery, as mainstream American lagers are. In principle, lagers can be dark, fierce, manly. Therefore, the correspondents suggest, it was wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Pete's Wicked for deceptive labeling, in presenting their tawnier, more flavorful beers as lagers too. 

         To this the beer scientist must say: Book-learning is fine in its place. But let's be realistic. Actual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a) all cheap beers are lagers; and b) most lagers are light-colored and weak. The first test was designed to evaluate low-end beers and therefore had to be lager-centric. This one is designed to test fancy beers--but in the spirit of open-mindedness and technical accuracy, it includes a few ""strong"" lagers too. 

                         3. 

            Materials. The 10 test beers were chosen with several goals in mind: 

          

            To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer types--extra special bitter, India pale ale, Hefeweizen, and so on. 

            To include both imported and domestic beers. Among the domestic microbrews, there's an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest. But as Microsoft would put it, that's a feature not a bug. These beers all came from the Safeway nearest the Redmond, Wash., ""main campus"" of Microsoft, and microbrews are supposed to be local. 

            To include one holdover from the previous test, as a scientific control on our tasters' preferences. This was Sam Adams , runaway winner of Round 1. 

            To include one fancy product from a monster-scale U.S. mass brewery, to see if the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews. This was Michelob Hefeweizen , from the pride of St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch. 

          

         Click for pricing information and pre-quaffing evaluations. The beers tasted were: 

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

                         4. Data Analysis.              

                         a)                 Best and Worst. Compared to the lager test, we would expect the range of ""best"" choices to be more varied, since all the tested beers were supposed to be good. This expectation was most dramatically borne out in the ""Best and Worst"" rankings. 

         The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votes and 11.5 Best votes. (Tester No. 1 turned in a sheet with three Best selections, or two more than his theoretical quota. Tester No. 4 listed a Best and a Best-minus, which counted as half a vote.) 

          The results were clearest at the bottom: three Worsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen , even though most comments about the beer were more or less respectful. (""Bitter, drinkable."") But at the top and middle the situation was muddier: 

           

         There were three Bests for Full Sail ESB , which most of the tasters later said they weren't familiar with, and 2.5 for Redhook IPA , which all the tasters knew. But each of these also got a Worst vote, and most of the other beers had a mixed reading. So far, the tasters are meeting expectations, finding something to like in nearly all these fancy beers. 

                         b)                 Overall preference points. Here the complications increase. The loser was again apparent: Pyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points, as it had in the Best/Worst derby. But the amazing dark horse winner was Michelob Hefeweizen . The three elements of surprise here, in ascending order of unexpectedness, are: 

          

            This best-liked beer belonged to the same category, Hefeweizen, as the least-liked product, from Pyramid. 

            This was also the only outright Anheuser-Busch product in the contest (the Redhooks are 75 percent A-B free). It is safe to say that all tasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrew last, and Anheuser-Busch last of all. 

            Although it clearly won on overall preference points, Michelob Hefeweizen was the only beer not to have received a single ""Best"" vote. 

          

         The first two anomalies can be written off as testament to the power of a blind taste test. The third suggests an important difference in concepts of ""bestness."" Sometimes a product seems to be the best of a group simply because it's the most unusual or distinctive. This is why very high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly taste odd. But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive, day-in day-out acceptability. That seems to be Michelob Hefe 's achievement here: no one's first choice, but high on everyone's list. Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch. 

            Remember to stay strictly in the scientist's role. Don't take the test yourself.

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .) 

          

                         2.                 Philosophy. The first round of testing was All Lager. This second round was All Fancy, and Mainly Not Lager. As several correspondents (for instance, the of Best American Beers ) have helpfully pointed out, the definition of lager provided last time was not exactly ""accurate."" If you want to stay within the realm of textbook definitions, a lager is a beer brewed a particular way--slowly, at cool temperatures, with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat. This is in contrast with an ale, which is brewed faster, warmer, and with the yeast on top. By this same reasoning, lagers don't have to be light-colored, weak-flavored, and watery, as mainstream American lagers are. In principle, lagers can be dark, fierce, manly. Therefore, the correspondents suggest, it was wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Pete's Wicked for deceptive labeling, in presenting their tawnier, more flavorful beers as lagers too. 

         To this the beer scientist must say: Book-learning is fine in its place. But let's be realistic. Actual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a) all cheap beers are lagers; and b) most lagers are light-colored and weak. The first test was designed to evaluate low-end beers and therefore had to be lager-centric. This one is designed to test fancy beers--but in the spirit of open-mindedness and technical accuracy, it includes a few ""strong"" lagers too. 

                         3. 

            Materials. The 10 test beers were chosen with several goals in mind: 

          

            To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer types--extra special bitter, India pale ale, Hefeweizen, and so on. 

            To include both imported and domestic beers. Among the domestic microbrews, there's an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest. But as Microsoft would put it, that's a feature not a bug. These beers all came from the Safeway nearest the Redmond, Wash., ""main campus"" of Microsoft, and microbrews are supposed to be local. 

            To include one holdover from the previous test, as a scientific control on our tasters' preferences. This was Sam Adams , runaway winner of Round 1. 

            To include one fancy product from a monster-scale U.S. mass brewery, to see if the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews. This was Michelob Hefeweizen , from the pride of St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch. 

          

         Click for pricing information and pre-quaffing evaluations. The beers tasted were: 

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

                         4. Data Analysis.              

                         a)                 Best and Worst. Compared to the lager test, we would expect the range of ""best"" choices to be more varied, since all the tested beers were supposed to be good. This expectation was most dramatically borne out in the ""Best and Worst"" rankings. 

         The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votes and 11.5 Best votes. (Tester No. 1 turned in a sheet with three Best selections, or two more than his theoretical quota. Tester No. 4 listed a Best and a Best-minus, which counted as half a vote.) 

          The results were clearest at the bottom: three Worsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen , even though most comments about the beer were more or less respectful. (""Bitter, drinkable."") But at the top and middle the situation was muddier: 

           

         There were three Bests for Full Sail ESB , which most of the tasters later said they weren't familiar with, and 2.5 for Redhook IPA , which all the tasters knew. But each of these also got a Worst vote, and most of the other beers had a mixed reading. So far, the tasters are meeting expectations, finding something to like in nearly all these fancy beers. 

                         b)                 Overall preference points. Here the complications increase. The loser was again apparent: Pyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points, as it had in the Best/Worst derby. But the amazing dark horse winner was Michelob Hefeweizen . The three elements of surprise here, in ascending order of unexpectedness, are: 

          

            This best-liked beer belonged to the same category, Hefeweizen, as the least-liked product, from Pyramid. 

            This was also the only outright Anheuser-Busch product in the contest (the Redhooks are 75 percent A-B free). It is safe to say that all tasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrew last, and Anheuser-Busch last of all. 

            Although it clearly won on overall preference points, Michelob Hefeweizen was the only beer not to have received a single ""Best"" vote. 

          

         The first two anomalies can be written off as testament to the power of a blind taste test. The third suggests an important difference in concepts of ""bestness."" Sometimes a product seems to be the best of a group simply because it's the most unusual or distinctive. This is why very high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly taste odd. But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive, day-in day-out acceptability. That seems to be Michelob Hefe 's achievement here: no one's first choice, but high on everyone's list. Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch.

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch. 

            Remember to stay strictly in the scientist's role. Don't take the test yourself.

         Sunday, Jan. 14, 1996: A day that will live in--well, not infamy, exactly. Blasphemy would be closer to it. 

         Early that afternoon, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the American Football Conference championship. Linebacker Greg Lloyd, accepting the trophy in front of a national television audience, responded with enthusiasm. ""Let's see if we can bring this damn thing back here next year,"" he said, ""along with the [expletive] Super Bowl."" 

         A few hours later, Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defense of his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference title: ""Nobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer. He took all of this [expletive] ."" 

         Iwatched those episodes, and, incongruous as it may sound, I thought of Kenneth Tynan. Britain's great postwar drama critic was no fan of American football, but he was a fan of swearing. Thirty years earlier, almost to the week, Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity as literary director of Britain's National Theater and asked if he would allow the theater to present a play in which sex took place on stage. ""Certainly,"" he replied. ""I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom the word '[expletive]' is particularly diabolical or revolting or totally forbidden."" 

         It turned out there were a few more than Tynan thought. Within 24 hours, resolutions had been introduced in the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenity, for his removal as a theater official, and for censure of the network for allowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves. Tynan escaped punishment, but he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for the rest his life. To much of ordinary Britain, he became the man who had said ""[expletive]"" on the BBC. 

         Neither Greg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized. ""It's live television,"" NBC Vice President Ed Markey said, rationalizing the outbursts. ""It's an emotional moment. These things happen."" Irvin wasn't about to let that stand. ""I knew exactly what I was saying,"" he insisted later. ""Those of you who can't believe I said it--believe it."" 

         Swearing isn't the only public act that Western civilization condones today but didn't 30 years ago. But it is one of the most interesting. It is everywhere, impossible to avoid or tune out. 

           

          

            I am sitting in a meeting at the office, talking with a colleague about a business circumstance that may possibly go against us. ""In that case, we're [expletive] ,"" he says. Five years ago, he would have said ""screwed."" Twenty years ago, he would have said, ""We're in big trouble."" Societal tolerance of profanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on.   

             

            I am walking along a suburban street, trailing a class of pre-schoolers who are linked to each other by a rope. A pair of teen-agers passes us in the other direction. By the time they have reached the end of the line of children, they have tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I was well into adolescence, let alone use in casual conversation on a public street.   

             

            I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about a foundation grant. I tell her something she wasn't aware of before. In 1965, the appropriate response was ""no kidding."" In 1996, you do not say ""no kidding."" It is limp and ineffectual. If you are surprised at all, you say what she says: ""No shit."" 

          

         What word is taboo in middle-class America in 1996? There are a couple of credible candidates: The four-letter word for ""vagina"" remains off-limits in polite conversation (although that has more to do with feminism than with profanity), and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sex with males is not yet acceptable by the standards of office-meeting etiquette. 

         But aside from a few exceptions, the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost to nothing as the 20th century comes to an end; the currency of swearing has been inflated to the brink of worthlessness. When almost anything can be said in public, profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all. 

         That most of the forbidden words of the 1950s are no longer forbidden will come as news to nobody: The steady debasement of the common language is only one of many social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to the current. What is important is that profanity served a variety of purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes any more. 

         What purposes? There are a couple of plausible answers. One of them is emotional release. Robert Graves, who wrote a book in the 1920s called The Future of Swearing , thought that profanity was the adult replacement for childhood tears. There comes a point in life, he wrote, when ""wailing is rightly discouraged, and groans are also considered a signal of extreme weakness. Silence under suffering is usually impossible."" So one reaches back for a word one does not normally use, and utters it without undue embarrassment or guilt. And one feels better--even stimulated. 

         The anthropologist Ashley Montagu, whose Anatomy of Swearing , published in 1967, is the definitive modern take on the subject, saw profanity as a safety valve rather than a stimulant, a verbal substitute for physical aggression. When someone swears, Montagu wrote, ""potentially noxious energy is converted into a form that renders it comparatively innocuous."" 

         One could point out, in arguing against the safety-valve theory, that as America has grown more profane in the past 30 years, it has also grown more violent, not less. But this is too simple. It isn't just the supply of dirty words that matters, it's their emotive power. If they have lost that power through overuse, it's perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deter aggressive behavior has weakened as well. 

         But there is something else important to say about swearing--that it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considers powerful, awesome, and a little scary. 

         I'm not sure there is an easy way to convey to anybody under 30, for example, the sheer emotive force that the word ""[expletive]"" possessed in the urban childhood culture of 40 years ago. It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood but that was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world. It was the embodiment of both pleasure and danger. It was not a word or an idea to mess with. When it was used, it was used, as Ashley Montagu said, ""sotto voce , like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbidden frontier."" 

         In that culture, the word ""[expletive]"" was not only obscene, it was profane, in the original sense: It took an important idea in vain. Profanity can be an act of religious defiance, but it doesn't have to be. The Greeks tempted fate by invoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus; they also swore upon everyday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understand. ""By the Cabbage!"" Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress, and that was for good reason. He believed that cabbage cured hangovers, and as such, carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with the requisite emotional charge. 

         These days, none of us believes in cabbage in the way Socrates did, or in the gods in the way most Athenians did. Most Americans tell poll-takers that they believe in God, but few of them in a way that would make it impossible to take His name in vain: That requires an Old Testament piety that disappeared from American middle-class life a long time ago. 

         Nor do we believe in sex any more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it a generation ago: as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did not engage in, or discuss, or even invoke, without a certain amount of excitement and risk. We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it just doesn't carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedrooms of the 1950s. 

         Many enlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society in which sex generated not only emotion and power, but fear. For the moment, I wish to insist only on this one point: When sexuality loses its power to awe, it loses its power to create genuine swearing. When we convert it into a casual form of recreation, we shouldn't be surprised to hear linebackers using the word ""[expletive]"" on national television. 

         To profane something, in other words, one must believe in it. The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against them. 

         The instinctive response of most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it, but this is wrong. Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos and prohibitions, if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure and define themselves. By violating these taboos over and over, some succeed in defining themselves as rebels. Others violate them on special occasions to derive an emotional release. Forbidden language is one of the ways we remind children that there are rules to everyday life, and consequences for breaking them. When we forget this principle, or cease to accept it, it is not just our language that begins to fray at the edges. 

         What do we do about it? Well, we could pass a law against swearing. Mussolini actually did that. He decreed that trains and buses, in addition to running on time, had to carry signs that read ""Non bestemmiare per l'onore d'Italia."" (""Do not swear for the honor of Italy."") The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as you would expect: They cursed them. 

         What Mussolini could not do, I am reasonably sure that American governments of the 1990s cannot do, nor would I wish it. I merely predict that sometime in the coming generation, profanity will return in a meaningful way. It served too many purposes for too many years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis. We need it. 

         And so I am reasonably sure that when my children have children, there will once again be words so awesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences. This will not only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution, it will be a token of moral revival. What the dirty words will be, God only knows.

         Now and then, a documentary film comes along that makes us re-examine the rules that unofficially govern the genre: Can there be a middle ground between fiction and fact? Can a documentary use scripted scenes and yet remain ontologically authentic? How much can you stylize material before you alter the reality that you're striving, at least in theory, to capture? 

                         Unmade Beds , Nicholas Barker's "" 'real life' feature film,"" has proudly worn its mongrel status as a ""directed"" documentary of single life in the big city, employing, in the face of criticism, what amounts to a cackling-punk defiance. The movie tracks four aging New Yorkers--two men, two women--through their lonely dating rituals, in the process depicting a universe of lusty, coupled-up haves and downcast, excluded have-nots, all viewed Rear Window -style through rectangular openings in the massive apartment houses in which they reside. 

         This is not cinema                 vérité , and nothing has been left to chance. The director selected his four subjects from many hundreds of potential candidates, followed them around for months, and then scripted their monologues and dialogues to reflect what he says he saw. Calling his own film ""an exercise in mendacity,"" Barker goes on, ""I'm quite happy to tell lies about my characters and even collude with their self-delusions if it enables me to communicate larger dramatic truths."" 

         Spurned by U.S. distributors, Unmade Beds opened two weeks ago in a small screening room in downtown Manhattan, where it proceeded to set box office records and generate lots of (largely favorable) press. In part due to smart publicity, which has bannered some of the bad reviews and commentary (""I have to tell you that this film upset me so much that I really don't want to have anything to do with it""--a New York publicist), it threatens to become a cause                 célèbre --and to be coming soon to a theater near you. It's always nice to see distributors proved wrong about the merits of ""difficult"" films, but in this case I think they did the decent thing. Unmade Beds isn't just bad--it's obnoxiously, noxiously bad, a freak show for the empathetically challenged. The outrage it has prompted isn't the Puritan kind; it's more like legitimate revulsion at watching a blowhard pervert people's lives in the name of ""larger dramatic truths."" 

         Those truths are large, all right. Take Michael, the 40-year-old, 5 foot 4 inch lonely guy who has been looking for a wife for almost two decades. If you were to walk past him on the street, you might think that a man of his small stature might have some trouble getting dates and be rather bitter about it. The larger dramatic truth is that Michael has lots of trouble getting dates and is very bitter about it. Just in case you feel too sorry for him, however, Barker is careful to include a homophobic monologue in which Michael complains about young women who waste their lives hanging out with effeminate males. 

          Michael turns out to be the film's most sympathetic subject--by a wide margin. At least he's not Mikey, a paunchy 54-year-old who writes but can't sell screenplays and who always flees blind dates, because the women he gets fixed up with are ""mutts."" Sounding like one of the low-level gangsters who posture like kingpins in Donnie Brasco , Mikey talks a lot about mutts. He also reminisces about that 24 hour period in the '70s when he managed to sleep with three different beautiful women, whose pictures he shows off. These days, all he meets are mutts. He comes off as a pathetic little loser--a mutt. 

         Aimee, on the other hand, is a pathetic big loser, weighing in at 225 pounds. Determined to get married before she turns 30, she generally is filmed beside bags of groceries and assorted junk foods. She cries about her situation to her thin friend, Laurie, who, in one scene, gently mentions Aimee's weight. Clearly the scene is scripted, but Aimee does a good job acting taken aback. She has always been fat--and she's ""OK with it,"" and a man just has to accept it. This is followed by more talk about how you attract men. Will they respect you if you call them back? If you express too much interest? ""Or,"" the viewer thinks, ""if you're 225 pounds?"" 

         The only natural performer here is Brenda, a garrulous exhibitionist who blossoms with the camera on her--she could have a career as a Penny Marshall-style character actress. Divorced and aging, Brenda needs money and is willing to charge for her sexual services. It shouldn't be too difficult, because men are always showing her their dicks (""I'm up to two dicks a day""). They meet her and, a few minutes later, they show her their dicks. Weird, huh? What Barker leaves out (it's in a New York Observer article) is that Brenda, a former lap dancer, works in marketing at a strip joint. Presumably, men standing next to her in line at McDonald's don't show her their dicks. Nor, presumably, does she show them her breasts--although she bares them for Barker's camera, jabbering about her body while she doffs her clothes and steps into the shower and soaps up. 

         Barker might have crafted his subjects' monologues from their own words, but he has robbed them of their spontaneity--and, thus, of their essence. They aren't thinking or trying to come to grips with their situations in front of your eyes, because they already know what they're going to say: They've been fixed like butterflies on the ends of pins and held up for voyeuristic inspection. The scenes with friends and confidantes have a crude, programmatic purpose. You can imagine the director composing a shot (the shots are tightly composed and elaborately lighted) and reminding them, ""In this scene she points out that you should lose weight and you get shocked and defensive. Ready ... Action."" 

          Call me square, but I find this antithetical to the documentary spirit. An Englishman who trained as an anthropologist before going to work for BBC Television, Barker clearly made up his mind about his material before his cameras began to roll--so it's no surprise that it feels prechewed and predigested. When reality interfered (Brenda apparently did not go through with a marriage to an immigrant in search of a green card for $10,000, as she does on-screen), Barker brushed the truth aside as immaterial, following her up the steps of City Hall in her wedding dress because it was ""true to her character."" But what separates documentary from fiction is that real people are often more complicated, and more conflicted, than finished characters--as Brenda proved to be more (or, at least, other) than the sum of her parts. That's the kind of truth that reveals itself to documentary filmmakers after the fact, when they go over footage and discover unexpected patterns, dissonances, glimmers of a universe that's richer and messier than the one they set out to portray. 

         So what are Barker's ""larger dramatic truths""? Single people in big cities can be desperate. Single people fear they're going to die alone--unloved and unloving. People are judged and, in turn, judge others by how they look. Big news. One could argue, charitably, that the movie is meant to be prescriptive, that Barker intends for us to regard the ways in which his subjects delude themselves and thereby learn to see through our own self-delusions. But Barker hasn't concocted a larger dramatic structure that would hold those larger dramatic truths together and help us comprehend where these people went wrong. He dramatizes right up to the point where a dramatist would be expected to provide some insight--and then, hey, he's a documentarian. 

                         Unmade Beds might make a good date movie. There's little to argue about in its subjects' personalities--both males and females will find them repulsive--and the picture the film paints of single life in the big city is so bleak that you'll probably want to jump into bed with whoever is sitting next to you. Anything to keep from turning into one of those people. 

         The Slums of Beverly Hills also walks a line between two genres, in this case coming-of-age sex comedy and autobiographical monologue. Tamara Jenkins, the writer and first-time director, has an eye for absurd juxtapositions that was obviously sharpened by the pain of her nomadic upbringing. Her protagonist (Natasha Lyonne) spends her teen-age years being shuttled with her two brothers from one cheap dive to another in the 90210 ZIP code, all because her egregiously unsuccessful father (Alan Arkin) wants them to be educated in the best schools. (""Furniture's temporary; education is permanent."") It's a major omission, then, that we never see those schools or the kids' interaction with their stable, well-to-do Beverly Hills counterparts. We can't tell if the father is, on some weird level, justified in his fervor, or whether he's screwing up his children--subjecting them to humiliation and robbing them of a sense of permanence--for no reason. Jenkins hasn't quite figured out how to shape her narrative, which is full of episodes that are there because they actually happened but that don't have a payoff. I almost wish she'd included more voice-over narration, more commentary on the things that, as a filmmaker, she hasn't learned to bring out. 

                         The Slums of Beverly Hills never gels, but it has a likable spirit, and it's exceedingly easy on the eye, with lots of pretty girls and wry evocations of '70s fashions and decor. The father, to obtain financial support from his wealthy brother (Carl Reiner), volunteers to take in his vaguely schizzy, dipsomaniacal niece (Marisa Tomei). She and her cousin compare breasts, play with vibrators, and talk in pig Latinish gibberish, but Jenkins never lets the proceedings get too sentimental: The whimsy is always cut with an acidic awareness of the family's desperation. ""Are we middle-class now?"" ask the children, hopefully, before another crisis sends them back into their van, cruising past the movie stars' mansions, in the mean streets of Beverly Hills. 

          Grading on the steep curve established by summer blockbuster seasons past, these have turned out to be a pretty good few months at the movies. Even the commercial swill ( Deep Impact , Armageddon , The Mask of Zorro , Small Soldiers , Snake Eyes , Halloween: H20 ) has been of a high grade, and Saving Private Ryan and Return to Paradise were Vitalis slaps in the kisser for people woozy from all the warm weather escapism. Out of Sight was tender and charming, as was, in its gross-out way, There's Something About Mary . And, on the indie front, The Opposite of Sex , Buffalo 66 , and Pi have proved that there's still commercial life after Sundance. Sure, we had stinkers, but even Godzilla was fun to jeer at. And there's something reassuring about the fact that The Avengers is so rotten: proof yet again that people with piles of money can hire wizard production designers but can't fake class. 

         I don't know who the credited screenwriter, Don MacPherson, is, but it's unlikely that he has ever seen an episode of the old Avengers , let alone sussed out the source of its appeal. Opening with a slapstick sequence of agent John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) doing kung fu, the film shifts to a scene in which he meets Mrs. Peel (Uma Thurman) while sitting naked in a sauna with only a newspaper to cover his private parts. The series was erotic in a way only prim English humor can be: The Old Boy Steed was capable of throwing a punch and bonking someone with his bowler, but he left the karate kicking to his liberated, leather-suited distaff associate. Here their roles have been witlessly muddled, and MacPherson's idea of banter is to have the pair complete each other's clichés. 

         Whereas the original Steed, Patrick Macnee, was to the English Men's Club born, Fiennes is an eternal caddie. The willowy Thurman looks great in her outfits, but it's ever more apparent that she isn't much of an actress--at least, not a trained one--and her attempts at insouciance are embarrassingly arch. As the eccentric master villain who controls the weather, even Sean Connery is flat-out terrible, acting high on the hog. To think Connery once found the Bond films so far beneath him! When he sputters lines like ""Time to die!"" one imagines Dr. No, Goldfinger, and Blofeld snickering in the wings.

24,"War and Pieces 

         No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful, rambling war epic The Thin Red Line , Terrence Malick's return to cinema after 20 years. I've sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out my responses, which run from awe to mockery and back. Like Saving Private Ryan , the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant, splattery battle montages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth. But Malick, a certified intellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands and Days                 of                 Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared, is in a different philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg. Post-carnage, his sundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy, runic voice-overs that come at you like slow bean balls: ""Why does nature vie with itself? ... Is there an avenging power in nature, not one power but two?"" Or ""This great evil: Where's it come from? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doin' this? Who's killin' us, robbin' us of life and light?"" First you get walloped with viscera, then you get beaned by blather. 

         Those existential speculations don't derive from the screenplay's source, an archetypal but otherwise down-to-earth 1962 novel by James Jones (who also wrote From Here to Eternity ) about the American invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal. They're central to Malick's vision of the story, however, and not specious. In the combat genre, the phrase ""war is hell"" usually means nothing more than that it's a bummer to lose a limb or two, or to see your buddy get his head blown off. A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors, and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God. 

         He tells the story solemnly, in three parts, with a big-deal cast (Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, John Cusack) and a few other major stars (John Travolta, Woody Harrelson, George Clooney) dropping by for cameos. After an Edenic prelude, in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier, Pvt. Witt (Jim Caviezel), swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children's choir, the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island, introduces the principal characters (none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist), and lays out the movie's geographical and philosophical terrain. The centerpiece--the fighting--goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences, chiefly the company's initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker. The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup, the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final, incongruous spasm of violence--whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle. In the final shot, a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach, the cycle of life beginning anew. 

                         The Thin Red Line has a curious sound-scape, as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer's bump-bump, minimalist New Age music. Pvt. Bell (Ben Chaplin) talks to his curvy, redheaded wife, viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks. (""Love: Where does it come from? Who lit this flame in us?"") Lt. Col. Tall (Nolte), a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost, worries groggily about how his men perceive him. The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we're all a part of one big soul. If the movie has a spine, it's his off-and-on dialogue with Sgt. Welsh (Penn), who's increasingly irritated by the private's beatific, almost Billy Budd-like optimism. Says Welsh, ""In this world, a man himself is nothin', and there ain't no world but this one."" Replies Witt, high cheekbones glinting, ""I seen another world."" At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh's vindictive Claggart. But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr, Welsh turns out to be a Bogart-like romantic who can't stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God. He speaks the movie's epitaph, ""Darkness and light, strife and love: Are they the workings of one mind, the feature of the same face? O my soul, let me be in you now. Look out through my eyes. Look out at the things you made, all things shining."" 

         Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen: soldiers, natives, parrots, bats, rodents, visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo. Malick's conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike; almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation. I could cite hundreds of images: A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he's writing, which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script. (You don't know the man, but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in.) A small, white-bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can't believe they're encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets. Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill; a second later, the sun plays mystically over the tall, yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies. John Toll's camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison: One Japanese soldier shrieks; another, skeletal, laughs and laughs; a third weeps over a dying comrade. The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead, ""Are you righteous? Know that I was, too."" 

         Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter. Malick throws out his overarching theme--is nature two-sided, at war with itself?--in the first few minutes but, for all his startling juxtapositions, he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of, say, Brian De Palma's Casualties of War (1989). Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt, The Thin Red Line 's other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte's ambition-crazed Tall and Capt. Staros (Elias Koteas), who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal--and futile--assault on a bunker. But matters of cause and effect don't really interest Malick. Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives, and heroism can win a war or a battle, he acknowledges. But Staros is ultimately sent packing, and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation. In fact, the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void. Tall quotes Homer's ""rosy-fingered dawn"" and orders a meaningless bombardment to ""buck the men up--it'll look like the Japs are catching hell."" Soldiers shoot at hazy figures, unsure whether they're Japanese or American. Men collide, blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades, stab themselves frantically with morphine needles, shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay. A tiny bird, mortally wounded, flutters in the grass. 

         Malick is convincing--at times overwhelming--on the subject of chaos. It's when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up, retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces: ""Where is it that we were together? Who is it that I lived with? Walked with? The brother. ... The friend. ... One mind."" I think I'd have an easier time with Malick's metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones--central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war. Couldn't it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti-natural, and that the Allies' cause was part of a violent but natural correction? You don't have to buy into Spielberg's Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there's a difference between World War II and Vietnam (or, for that matter, World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq). While he was at Harvard, Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy-headed mentor, Stanley Cavell, the philosopher and film theorist, and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer's lectures on just and unjust wars. Maybe then he'd view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum (the soldiers come, they kill and are killed, they leave) but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational (in its aims, if not its methods) fought in the last several centuries. For all his visionary filmmaking, Malick's Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated--and pretentious--brand of fatuousness. 

         John Travolta's empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors (1998) had one positive result: It gave him a jump-start on Jan Schlichtmann, the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action . Travolta's Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton: slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels, too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost. Schlichtmann pursued--and more or less blew--a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W.R. Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn, Mass. Boston writer Jonathan Harr, in the book the movie is based on, went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke (stopping just short of libel) the poison of the civil courts, where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria. 

         Director Steven Zaillian's version doesn't capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr's book, or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham's The Rainmaker (1997). But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work, an old-fashioned conversion narrative with some high-tech zip. Schlichtmann doesn't take this ""orphan"" case--brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia--because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children's last days. He might succeed, too, if it weren't for Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm's financial resources dwindle to nothing. 

         Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher's Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann's fumbling prosecution. The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism: It dramatizes and comments simultaneously. Plus, it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement. (Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies.) Elsewhere, Zaillian takes a more surface approach, sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil. As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta. Beatrice and Grace made out OK legally, but some of us will never use their products again without thinking about Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted-away little kids.

As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer (1993), the outcome of every scene is predictable, but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh. He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO, William H. Macy as Schlichtmann's rabbity accountant, and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims. Quinlan knows that when you're playing a woman who has lost a child you don't need to emote--you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote. 

         To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy, the real climax of this story isn't the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand, ""let's call the Environmental Protection Agency,"" upbeat ending of the movie. The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs' side and that remains on the best-seller list in hardcover and paperback for years. The climax is the movie starring John Travolta. Beatrice and Grace made out OK legally, but some of us will never use their products again without thinking about Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted-away little kids.

                         Elizabeth is a lurid paraphrase of the old Groucho Marx line about Doris Day: ""I knew the Virgin Queen before she was a virgin."" As the movie tells it, she was a sylvan, redheaded princess (Cate Blanchett) given to gamboling with her fella (Joseph Fiennes) between periods of internment in the Tower of London on charges of conspiring to overthrow her half-sister, the heatedly Catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke). The daughter of the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and therefore dubbed a bastard by the papists, the Protestant Elizabeth ascends the throne to find the air still thick with smoke from roasted heretics, a team of skulking Catholics plotting her assassination, and a council of advisers (lords, bishops, sundry old boys) who snigger openly at the prospect of taking orders from a woman. Only a strategic marriage to a Spaniard or a Frenchman will mollify all factions, her advisers insist, but the pickings prove dismal. (Her French suitor enjoys wearing dresses.) After skulls are smashed, throats slit, and bosoms skewered in the name of Christ, Elizabeth decides to: a) ""unsex"" herself and become a symbol--the Virgin Queen, married only to England; and b) entertain dissenting opinions exclusively from those whose heads are affixed to spikes. 

         You can't be both a queenly queen and a womanly woman, says the script (by Michael Hirst)--at least not in 1554. (The director, Shekhar Kapur, made the same point in his grim 1994 Indian epic The Bandit Queen , against a backdrop of scrubby plains along the Ganges.) Is this feminist take historically accurate? Probably, although the evidence suggests that Elizabeth had developed a head for stratagems earlier in life (her position had been precarious since the beheading of her mother) and came to the throne with few girlish illusions about How Things Work in a barbarous state. 

         That said, the movie's approach makes for juicy melodrama. The tone of Elizabeth comes nearer to the nihilistic relish of Jacobeans such as John Ford and John Webster than to the more sorrowful horror of the Elizabethan dramatists Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare. It's even closer to a Jacobean drama of our own age: The Godfather (1972), which it emulates by cutting back-and-forth between queen and courtiers in prayer and the roundup and slaughter of Catholics on their privies, in bed with their mistresses, and so on. Their severed heads look on, wide-eyed, as Elizabeth directs her hair to be shorn--images of her girlhood flashing by as her locks rain down--and then walks weightily to her throne, now a chalk-faced gorgon. 

         With all due respect to Blanchett, Bette Davis, and Glenda Jackson, my favorite Elizabeth I remains Miranda Richardson's capricious, baby-talking psychopath on the BBC comedy Blackadder II . (Casting about for a new lord high executioner, she mews to Rowan Atkinson, ""There are thousands of Catholics simply dying to have their heads sneaked off --and there's no one to organize it."") But Blanchett comes in a close second, pulling off the transition from hapless young woman to coolly ruthless monarch with uncommon subtlety. Gradually expunging all empathy from her moist, pink eyes and permitting her visage to ossify, she gives this carnival of carnage an awe-inspiring center. 

          A more subversive sort of queen is on display in Velvet Goldmine , Todd Haynes' musical fantasia on the early '70s era of ""glam"" or ""glitter"" rock. Here the monarch is a David Bowie-esque singer called Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his spidery, space-age alter ego, Maxwell Demon. The movie opens with a spaceship depositing an infant Oscar Wilde on the stoop of a Dublin townhouse. Then it skips ahead to track a jade pin (it signifies hedonistic liberation) from the custody of a young Wilde to a swishy fringe creature called Jack Fairy to the regal Slade, a bisexual superstar who carries the news to all the young dudes. After that, we're in an Orwellian 1984 that's presided over by a vaguely fascist president and by arena rockers who serve as propagandists for a repressively conformist state. Whatever happened to Brian Slade, the glitter kids, the visionary exhibitionists and gleeful poseurs? Borrowing its framework from Citizen Kane , the movie follows a reporter (Christian Bale) assigned to reconstruct Slade's life and solve the mystery of his whereabouts. 

         Whatever you make of Velvet Goldmine (opinions have ranged from rapturous to casually dismissive), it's like no other musical ever made. It's determinedly swirling, discursive, elliptical. Now the story is told by an omniscient narrator, now a TV reporter, now a participant. Now it's flashing back, now forward. Every other line of dialogue is a cue for one of its dazzling numbers, largely covers of songs by Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, and T. Rex. The narrative is a challenge to keep up with, but then, great artists often invent their own syntax. In the '80s, Haynes employed Barbie dolls to depict the rise and wasting away from anorexia of the singer Karen Carpenter. Lucky audiences who caught Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (it was shelved when Richard Carpenter served the producers with an order to cease and desist exhibition) began by laughing at this elaborately posed, soft-rock femme, only to discover by the climax that the cultural forces that were eating at her (and that kept her from eating) had grown heartbreakingly palpable. Poison (1991), Haynes' Genêt-inspired exploration of transgression, didn't overcome its own artiness. But Safe (1995), the story of a Reagan-era housewife (Julianne Moore) convinced that her environment is poisoning her, is an entrancing meditation on the power of culture to crush the individual. Despite its ironic detachment, the film draws you into its heroine's sickly state: Breathing oxygen from a canister inside a high-tech igloo, she dwindles to nearly nothing, the modern incarnation of the Incredible Shrinking Man. 

         (It was partly my passion for Haynes' films that led me to accept a job offer from his indefatigable producer Christine Vachon last year to collaborate on a nuts-and-bolts book about producing, Shooting To Kill . So my review of Velvet Goldmine --like my review of Vachon's other recent release, Happiness --should be read as the work of a partisan. But not a blind partisan.) 

         In Velvet Goldmine , Haynes sets out to demonstrate the power of popular music to change people's lives--to tell them it's OK to fashion themselves into anything they please. The core of the movie turns out not to be the Bowie figure but the journalist, Arthur Stuart, who was a witness to the events he's now reconstructing. Bale is such an expressive performer that Stuart's remembrance of things past attains a Proustian intensity. To him, Slade was a sexual messiah. I've never seen a more vivid distillation of rock's allure than the scene in which he reverently opens the new Brian Slade album--its centerfold image is a lithe, naked, green-tinged Maxwell Demon--slips the vinyl out of its paper jacket and, after gingerly setting the LP on the turntable, props a chair under the doorknob to keep the uncomprehending world at bay. 

         But if Haynes wants Velvet Goldmine to be an anthem to the principles Bowie once embodied--the embrace of artifice and the smashing of conventional sexual roles--he also wants to portray the rocker as a hollow opportunist who abandoned glam and bisexuality for the life of a corporate superstar, throwing in his lot with the forces of repression. That's a lot to cover. An actor of stature might have bridged these two impulses, but the beautiful, brazenly slim-hipped Rhys-Meyers doesn't make his lines sound as if he's thinking them up on the spot, and Slade's self-destructive passion for Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), the film's fuzzy, sweet Iggy Pop figure, seems less an emotional imperative than a thematic one. 

         A case can be made that Velvet Goldmine isn't fully filled in, and that Haynes, who has never shaken off his background as a semiotics major, has made a movie that's all signifiers. I sometimes found myself wishing he would let the picture catch its breath, that the performers would stop coming at me in stroboscopic flashes. But then I'd be swept up in the sinuous motion of his filmmaking, in the elation of watching point of view passed like a baton from hand to hand, in the liberating force of his language and soundtrack. Velvet Goldmine might seem like a collection of baubles, but those baubles are strung. 

          Is Brad Pitt the worst actor on earth? The case could be made, and Meet Joe Black could serve as Exhibit A. Pitt plays two roles in this seven course schlockfest. He's (briefly) a slick but wholesome yuppie and then (interminably) Death, who takes over the young man's body when he's thumped by a couple of cars in the movie's most promising moment. Bleached so blond that he looks like an irradiated android, Pitt expels all expression from his face and all tone from his voice. He speaks very, very slowly. The stunt half-works, at least until he's supposed to undergo an inner transformation and acquire human emotions--whereupon his face remains just as blank. Pitt's conception of the role is an idée fixe by someone who doesn't appear to have an idée in his head. 

         Martin Brest, the director, is known for shooting a ton of footage and then ""finding"" his films in the editing room. What do you suppose he ""found"" when he scrutinized these miles of celluloid with Pitt doing nothing and taking his sweet time doing it? The first adaptation of this story (originally a play) was the 1934 Death Takes a Holiday , which came in at a perky 78 minutes. A conceit this fragile needs to whiz along to keep our disbelief in suspension, but Meet Joe Black grinds on for three hours (longer than either Beloved or Saving Private Ryan ), and Pitt acts as if he has leased the screen by the year. 

         Anthony Hopkins plays the zillionaire communications baron whom Death enlists in the hope of understanding the human condition--an odd choice for a tour guide, since most people's condition doesn't involve personal helicopters, sprawling mansions on Long Island Sound, or Manhattan apartments that sport Olympic-size swimming pools. Four screenwriters, among them the great Bo Goldman ( Melvin and Howard , 1980; Shoot the Moon , 1982), labored on this moldy script, which features characters who ask questions that begin ""Am I to understand that ...?"" and a corporate villain who directs another character to ""wake up and smell the thorns."" It apparently never occurred to even one of these overpaid scribes to eliminate Hopkins' rueful realization that he'd ""never write the great American novel""--no kidding, given his flagrantly Welsh accent. 

         Actually, Hopkins gives this humanistic magnate considerable weight, so that whether or not Death takes him before he can stop to smell the roses and make amends to his neglected children becomes a matter of some suspense. The rest of the cast works with equal fortitude, especially Jeffrey Tambor (Hank ""Hey now!"" Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show ) as Hopkins' milksop son-in-law and Marcia Gay Harden as his party planning, perpetually wilting elder daughter. As the younger daughter, the dark eyed, spaghetti thin Claire Forlani has to carry the picture's bathos on her exquisite shoulders. Her tremulous thoroughbred act wears thin, but it's hardly her fault: She has to emote like mad opposite a black pit of death--or is that the Black Death of Pitt?

Bleached so blond that he looks like an irradiated android, Pitt expels all expression from his face and all tone from his voice. He speaks very, very slowly. The stunt half-works, at least until he's supposed to undergo an inner transformation and acquire human emotions--whereupon his face remains just as blank. Pitt's conception of the role is an idée fixe by someone who doesn't appear to have an idée in his head. 

         Martin Brest, the director, is known for shooting a ton of footage and then ""finding"" his films in the editing room. What do you suppose he ""found"" when he scrutinized these miles of celluloid with Pitt doing nothing and taking his sweet time doing it? The first adaptation of this story (originally a play) was the 1934 Death Takes a Holiday , which came in at a perky 78 minutes. A conceit this fragile needs to whiz along to keep our disbelief in suspension, but Meet Joe Black grinds on for three hours (longer than either Beloved or Saving Private Ryan ), and Pitt acts as if he has leased the screen by the year. 

         Anthony Hopkins plays the zillionaire communications baron whom Death enlists in the hope of understanding the human condition--an odd choice for a tour guide, since most people's condition doesn't involve personal helicopters, sprawling mansions on Long Island Sound, or Manhattan apartments that sport Olympic-size swimming pools. Four screenwriters, among them the great Bo Goldman ( Melvin and Howard , 1980; Shoot the Moon , 1982), labored on this moldy script, which features characters who ask questions that begin ""Am I to understand that ...?"" and a corporate villain who directs another character to ""wake up and smell the thorns."" It apparently never occurred to even one of these overpaid scribes to eliminate Hopkins' rueful realization that he'd ""never write the great American novel""--no kidding, given his flagrantly Welsh accent. 

         Actually, Hopkins gives this humanistic magnate considerable weight, so that whether or not Death takes him before he can stop to smell the roses and make amends to his neglected children becomes a matter of some suspense. The rest of the cast works with equal fortitude, especially Jeffrey Tambor (Hank ""Hey now!"" Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show ) as Hopkins' milksop son-in-law and Marcia Gay Harden as his party planning, perpetually wilting elder daughter. As the younger daughter, the dark eyed, spaghetti thin Claire Forlani has to carry the picture's bathos on her exquisite shoulders. Her tremulous thoroughbred act wears thin, but it's hardly her fault: She has to emote like mad opposite a black pit of death--or is that the Black Death of Pitt?

                         Elizabeth is a lurid paraphrase of the old Groucho Marx line about Doris Day: ""I knew the Virgin Queen before she was a virgin."" As the movie tells it, she was a sylvan, redheaded princess (Cate Blanchett) given to gamboling with her fella (Joseph Fiennes) between periods of internment in the Tower of London on charges of conspiring to overthrow her half-sister, the heatedly Catholic Queen Mary (Kathy Burke). The daughter of the second wife of Henry VIII, Anne Boleyn, and therefore dubbed a bastard by the papists, the Protestant Elizabeth ascends the throne to find the air still thick with smoke from roasted heretics, a team of skulking Catholics plotting her assassination, and a council of advisers (lords, bishops, sundry old boys) who snigger openly at the prospect of taking orders from a woman. Only a strategic marriage to a Spaniard or a Frenchman will mollify all factions, her advisers insist, but the pickings prove dismal. (Her French suitor enjoys wearing dresses.) After skulls are smashed, throats slit, and bosoms skewered in the name of Christ, Elizabeth decides to: a) ""unsex"" herself and become a symbol--the Virgin Queen, married only to England; and b) entertain dissenting opinions exclusively from those whose heads are affixed to spikes. 

         You can't be both a queenly queen and a womanly woman, says the script (by Michael Hirst)--at least not in 1554. (The director, Shekhar Kapur, made the same point in his grim 1994 Indian epic The Bandit Queen , against a backdrop of scrubby plains along the Ganges.) Is this feminist take historically accurate? Probably, although the evidence suggests that Elizabeth had developed a head for stratagems earlier in life (her position had been precarious since the beheading of her mother) and came to the throne with few girlish illusions about How Things Work in a barbarous state. 

         That said, the movie's approach makes for juicy melodrama. The tone of Elizabeth comes nearer to the nihilistic relish of Jacobeans such as John Ford and John Webster than to the more sorrowful horror of the Elizabethan dramatists Ben Jonson and William Shakespeare. It's even closer to a Jacobean drama of our own age: The Godfather (1972), which it emulates by cutting back-and-forth between queen and courtiers in prayer and the roundup and slaughter of Catholics on their privies, in bed with their mistresses, and so on. Their severed heads look on, wide-eyed, as Elizabeth directs her hair to be shorn--images of her girlhood flashing by as her locks rain down--and then walks weightily to her throne, now a chalk-faced gorgon. 

         With all due respect to Blanchett, Bette Davis, and Glenda Jackson, my favorite Elizabeth I remains Miranda Richardson's capricious, baby-talking psychopath on the BBC comedy Blackadder II . (Casting about for a new lord high executioner, she mews to Rowan Atkinson, ""There are thousands of Catholics simply dying to have their heads sneaked off --and there's no one to organize it."") But Blanchett comes in a close second, pulling off the transition from hapless young woman to coolly ruthless monarch with uncommon subtlety. Gradually expunging all empathy from her moist, pink eyes and permitting her visage to ossify, she gives this carnival of carnage an awe-inspiring center. 

          A more subversive sort of queen is on display in Velvet Goldmine , Todd Haynes' musical fantasia on the early '70s era of ""glam"" or ""glitter"" rock. Here the monarch is a David Bowie-esque singer called Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and his spidery, space-age alter ego, Maxwell Demon. The movie opens with a spaceship depositing an infant Oscar Wilde on the stoop of a Dublin townhouse. Then it skips ahead to track a jade pin (it signifies hedonistic liberation) from the custody of a young Wilde to a swishy fringe creature called Jack Fairy to the regal Slade, a bisexual superstar who carries the news to all the young dudes. After that, we're in an Orwellian 1984 that's presided over by a vaguely fascist president and by arena rockers who serve as propagandists for a repressively conformist state. Whatever happened to Brian Slade, the glitter kids, the visionary exhibitionists and gleeful poseurs? Borrowing its framework from Citizen Kane , the movie follows a reporter (Christian Bale) assigned to reconstruct Slade's life and solve the mystery of his whereabouts. 

         Whatever you make of Velvet Goldmine (opinions have ranged from rapturous to casually dismissive), it's like no other musical ever made. It's determinedly swirling, discursive, elliptical. Now the story is told by an omniscient narrator, now a TV reporter, now a participant. Now it's flashing back, now forward. Every other line of dialogue is a cue for one of its dazzling numbers, largely covers of songs by Brian Eno, Bryan Ferry, and T. Rex. The narrative is a challenge to keep up with, but then, great artists often invent their own syntax. In the '80s, Haynes employed Barbie dolls to depict the rise and wasting away from anorexia of the singer Karen Carpenter. Lucky audiences who caught Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story (it was shelved when Richard Carpenter served the producers with an order to cease and desist exhibition) began by laughing at this elaborately posed, soft-rock femme, only to discover by the climax that the cultural forces that were eating at her (and that kept her from eating) had grown heartbreakingly palpable. Poison (1991), Haynes' Genêt-inspired exploration of transgression, didn't overcome its own artiness. But Safe (1995), the story of a Reagan-era housewife (Julianne Moore) convinced that her environment is poisoning her, is an entrancing meditation on the power of culture to crush the individual. Despite its ironic detachment, the film draws you into its heroine's sickly state: Breathing oxygen from a canister inside a high-tech igloo, she dwindles to nearly nothing, the modern incarnation of the Incredible Shrinking Man. 

         (It was partly my passion for Haynes' films that led me to accept a job offer from his indefatigable producer Christine Vachon last year to collaborate on a nuts-and-bolts book about producing, Shooting To Kill . So my review of Velvet Goldmine --like my review of Vachon's other recent release, Happiness --should be read as the work of a partisan. But not a blind partisan.) 

         In Velvet Goldmine , Haynes sets out to demonstrate the power of popular music to change people's lives--to tell them it's OK to fashion themselves into anything they please. The core of the movie turns out not to be the Bowie figure but the journalist, Arthur Stuart, who was a witness to the events he's now reconstructing. Bale is such an expressive performer that Stuart's remembrance of things past attains a Proustian intensity. To him, Slade was a sexual messiah. I've never seen a more vivid distillation of rock's allure than the scene in which he reverently opens the new Brian Slade album--its centerfold image is a lithe, naked, green-tinged Maxwell Demon--slips the vinyl out of its paper jacket and, after gingerly setting the LP on the turntable, props a chair under the doorknob to keep the uncomprehending world at bay. 

         But if Haynes wants Velvet Goldmine to be an anthem to the principles Bowie once embodied--the embrace of artifice and the smashing of conventional sexual roles--he also wants to portray the rocker as a hollow opportunist who abandoned glam and bisexuality for the life of a corporate superstar, throwing in his lot with the forces of repression. That's a lot to cover. An actor of stature might have bridged these two impulses, but the beautiful, brazenly slim-hipped Rhys-Meyers doesn't make his lines sound as if he's thinking them up on the spot, and Slade's self-destructive passion for Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), the film's fuzzy, sweet Iggy Pop figure, seems less an emotional imperative than a thematic one. 

         A case can be made that Velvet Goldmine isn't fully filled in, and that Haynes, who has never shaken off his background as a semiotics major, has made a movie that's all signifiers. I sometimes found myself wishing he would let the picture catch its breath, that the performers would stop coming at me in stroboscopic flashes. But then I'd be swept up in the sinuous motion of his filmmaking, in the elation of watching point of view passed like a baton from hand to hand, in the liberating force of his language and soundtrack. Velvet Goldmine might seem like a collection of baubles, but those baubles are strung.

26,"Dole vs. the
Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind. It's true that coverage of Clinton on the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole, as even other Times reporters acknowledge. But the explanation is institutional, not ideological. The press, as many have complained, overemphasizes the ""horse race"" aspect of politics. As a side effect of that disease, reporters have excessive respect for a well-run campaign. (In 1988, Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon.) A cruder reality is that reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday. 

         None of these factors, though, is unique to the Times . So why is Dole singling it out? Dole's attacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise in populist demagogy. In one of his great cue-card reading remarks, Dole tried to explain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying, ""I like the media. They don't like them in the South."" But this pat explanation doesn't entirely make sense. Red meat for right-wing crowds doesn't help Dole with the centrist voters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen. And in fact, according to a senior Dole aide, the attacks are heartfelt on the candidate's part. Dole has been going after the Times over the objections of advisers who have been telling him there's no percentage in picking fights with the press. 

         But if Dole is attacking the Times because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will help him get elected, what is he so angry about? The answer, I think, is that there has always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole, by which I mean a part of him which feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment. At the Republican convention, Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a ""corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned."" That phrase recalled an attack he made on the press long ago, in the days of Watergate, when he accused the Washington Post of being in bed with George McGovern. ""There is a cultural and social affinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editors,"" Dole said then. ""They belong to the same elite: They can be found living cheek-by-jowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods, and hob-nobbing at the same Georgetown parties."" The deeper story here isn't whether Dole was wrongly shunted onto D19 when he ought to have been on A1. It's his feelings, as he says goodbye to politics, about the people who get to decide.

Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes:

With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind. It's true that coverage of Clinton on the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole, as even other Times reporters acknowledge. But the explanation is institutional, not ideological. The press, as many have complained, overemphasizes the ""horse race"" aspect of politics. As a side effect of that disease, reporters have excessive respect for a well-run campaign. (In 1988, Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon.) A cruder reality is that reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday. 

         None of these factors, though, is unique to the Times . So why is Dole singling it out? Dole's attacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise in populist demagogy. In one of his great cue-card reading remarks, Dole tried to explain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying, ""I like the media. They don't like them in the South."" But this pat explanation doesn't entirely make sense. Red meat for right-wing crowds doesn't help Dole with the centrist voters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen. And in fact, according to a senior Dole aide, the attacks are heartfelt on the candidate's part. Dole has been going after the Times over the objections of advisers who have been telling him there's no percentage in picking fights with the press. 

         But if Dole is attacking the Times because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will help him get elected, what is he so angry about? The answer, I think, is that there has always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole, by which I mean a part of him which feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment. At the Republican convention, Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a ""corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned."" That phrase recalled an attack he made on the press long ago, in the days of Watergate, when he accused the Washington Post of being in bed with George McGovern. ""There is a cultural and social affinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editors,"" Dole said then. ""They belong to the same elite: They can be found living cheek-by-jowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods, and hob-nobbing at the same Georgetown parties."" The deeper story here isn't whether Dole was wrongly shunted onto D19 when he ought to have been on A1. It's his feelings, as he says goodbye to politics, about the people who get to decide.

Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking.""

27,"eBabe 

         This week, soft-porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion models on the Internet. His site, ronsangels.com (named after the 1970s' babe show Charlie's Angels ), invites visitors to ""bid on eggs from beautiful, healthy and intelligent women."" Like Dr. Richard Seed, who recently declared his intention to clone human beings, Harris has attracted the attention of the media and politicians who are ""looking into"" whether he can be stopped. Most people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage. What they don't agree on is why. Here's what the critics have to say about the auction--and each other. 

          

            1. Egg auctions will produce designer babies. Harris cites his experience as a horse breeder and asks, ""We bid for everything else in this society--why not eggs?"" Alarmists, agreeing that Harris ""can put you into your own designer baby by selling eggs,"" predict that his success will steer ""the future of human breeding"" toward ""genetic engineering."" 

          

            2. Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies. While fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds, fertility experts simultaneously debunk that scenario. ""Not only is it ethically ludicrous, but the fact is, no kid's going to look like the model's picture,"" observes ethicist George Annas. The experts give four reasons. First, the child of an ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty. Second, everyone carries ""recessive"" genes, which are invisible in this generation but may become visible in the next. A model with a small nose can pass on genes for a big nose. Third, even if both parents are attractive, a child can combine their features unattractively. For example, a girl can inherit her mother's weak nose and her father's strong brow. 

          

            3. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest. Doomsayers predict that once ""beautiful eggs are available strictly to people who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them,"" the rich will transform themselves into a ""super-race"" reminiscent of the Nazis. To this, Harris replies, ""It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of only beautiful people. This site simply mirrors our current society, in that beauty usually goes to the highest bidder."" But this reply only fuels concern that gradually, society will separate into ""genetic haves and have nots."" 

          

            4. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest. Harris writes that only men with ""substantial financial resources"" are fit to give his models' offspring ""a financially secure and stable life."" But skeptics wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder--and men who buy these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good-looking children--may produce children just as dysfunctional as themselves. As Calgary Sun columnist Sydney Sharpe put it, ""Any woman ... who enters into this mephistophelian pact has a few screws loose. Maybe her kid will, too. Not to mention the buyers who sign her up."" 

          

            5. Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the unfittest. Many models, if not most, have had cosmetic surgery. A model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs. (One of Harris' ""angels"" has already been caught lying about her age.) How does Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs? ""There's no way to know that. You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the truth,"" he says. Annas concludes that since there's ""no way to know how much of their beauty is a product of their genes, plastic surgery, a makeup artist, or exercise,"" only a ""naive"" person would buy their eggs on the basis of the photographs displayed on the site. ""You don't want to see the models,"" he points out. ""You want to see pictures of their parents."" On this theory, children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on one side and fools on the other. 

          

            6. Beauty doesn't convey health. Harris casually asserts that beauty ""shows healthiness and longevity."" On his site, he writes, "" 'Natural Selection' is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful."" Skeptics question this assumed equivalence, noting that traits men find attractive in women these days--thinness, for example--are often unhealthy. When asked on the Today show how much ""medical screening"" he has given his egg donors, Harris answered, ""None."" 

          

            7. Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence. Harris says he's not the first person to market good genes. Others, he notes, have sold sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor's intelligence. Harris' detractors reply that beauty is ""superficial"" and conveys a ""harmful preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of character."" This critique is usually offered by a blow-dried TV interviewer who, after thanking Harris for his time, urges viewers to stay tuned for the movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break. 

          

            8. Beauty is less useful than intelligence. Harris advertises beauty not as an end but as a means to ""success,"" since people who are physically desirable get more attention, power, and favorable treatment. Having chided Harris for exalting social advantage over ""character,"" critics turn around and adopt his ruthless logic. While conceding that beauty is useful, they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today's meritocratic information economy--and that although Harris claims his models are ""beautiful, healthy and intelligent,"" he offers no evidence of brains, such as IQ or SAT scores. London's Independent envisions ""Bimbo births."" A fertility expert shrugs, ""If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them."" 

          

            9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure capitalism, saying it's ""unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make money"" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of ""taking advantage of couples trying to conceive"" and exploiting ""desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell."" USA Today laments, ""This is about human need. And human greed."" 

          

            10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday, Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction. Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA Today described the models as ""struggling actresses,"" reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying, ""I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse ."" Harris' sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was ""better than prostitution."" 

         Harris constantly refers to the donors as his ""girls"" and describes them like cattle--""We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls."" He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures. ""We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items,"" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to ""find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on the Web."" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps like him have come away with the profit. 

          

            11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models), hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels.com is really aimed at ""adolescent boys."" 

          

            12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. ""Ever since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs,"" one fertility expert complains to the New York Times . USA Today says the egg auction ""just might force an Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the Internet taking us?"" 

          

            13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases. The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. ""When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,"" a computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that ""there's very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,"" and ""the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from."" 

          

            14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences. Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today show, Harris said of this theory, ""That's a pretty cynical view of human nature."") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples. 

          

            15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that ""having sex is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the next generation."" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words: ""our genes."" ""The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the [drive] to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site,"" Fisher observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself. 

          

            16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited. Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious response is to attack the whole ""prejudice"" in favor of beauty. ""The standards of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts, not really genetics facts,"" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, ""we should think about"" whether to ""accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them"" or to transcend those prejudices. 

         This critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start with the latter rather than the former? 

         Second, Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection. ""Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,"" he writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become more than material. At least, most of us have.

Most people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage. What they don't agree on is why. Here's what the critics have to say about the auction--and each other. 

          

            1. Egg auctions will produce designer babies. Harris cites his experience as a horse breeder and asks, ""We bid for everything else in this society--why not eggs?"" Alarmists, agreeing that Harris ""can put you into your own designer baby by selling eggs,"" predict that his success will steer ""the future of human breeding"" toward ""genetic engineering."" 

          

            2. Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies. While fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds, fertility experts simultaneously debunk that scenario. ""Not only is it ethically ludicrous, but the fact is, no kid's going to look like the model's picture,"" observes ethicist George Annas. The experts give four reasons. First, the child of an ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty. Second, everyone carries ""recessive"" genes, which are invisible in this generation but may become visible in the next. A model with a small nose can pass on genes for a big nose. Third, even if both parents are attractive, a child can combine their features unattractively. For example, a girl can inherit her mother's weak nose and her father's strong brow. 

          

            3. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest. Doomsayers predict that once ""beautiful eggs are available strictly to people who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them,"" the rich will transform themselves into a ""super-race"" reminiscent of the Nazis. To this, Harris replies, ""It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of only beautiful people. This site simply mirrors our current society, in that beauty usually goes to the highest bidder."" But this reply only fuels concern that gradually, society will separate into ""genetic haves and have nots."" 

          

            4. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest. Harris writes that only men with ""substantial financial resources"" are fit to give his models' offspring ""a financially secure and stable life."" But skeptics wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder--and men who buy these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good-looking children--may produce children just as dysfunctional as themselves. As Calgary Sun columnist Sydney Sharpe put it, ""Any woman ... who enters into this mephistophelian pact has a few screws loose. Maybe her kid will, too. Not to mention the buyers who sign her up."" 

          

            5. Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the unfittest. Many models, if not most, have had cosmetic surgery. A model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs. (One of Harris' ""angels"" has already been caught lying about her age.) How does Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs? ""There's no way to know that. You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the truth,"" he says. Annas concludes that since there's ""no way to know how much of their beauty is a product of their genes, plastic surgery, a makeup artist, or exercise,"" only a ""naive"" person would buy their eggs on the basis of the photographs displayed on the site. ""You don't want to see the models,"" he points out. ""You want to see pictures of their parents."" On this theory, children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on one side and fools on the other. 

          

            6. Beauty doesn't convey health. Harris casually asserts that beauty ""shows healthiness and longevity."" On his site, he writes, "" 'Natural Selection' is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful."" Skeptics question this assumed equivalence, noting that traits men find attractive in women these days--thinness, for example--are often unhealthy. When asked on the Today show how much ""medical screening"" he has given his egg donors, Harris answered, ""None."" 

          

            7. Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence. Harris says he's not the first person to market good genes. Others, he notes, have sold sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor's intelligence. Harris' detractors reply that beauty is ""superficial"" and conveys a ""harmful preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of character."" This critique is usually offered by a blow-dried TV interviewer who, after thanking Harris for his time, urges viewers to stay tuned for the movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break. 

          

            8. Beauty is less useful than intelligence. Harris advertises beauty not as an end but as a means to ""success,"" since people who are physically desirable get more attention, power, and favorable treatment. Having chided Harris for exalting social advantage over ""character,"" critics turn around and adopt his ruthless logic. While conceding that beauty is useful, they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today's meritocratic information economy--and that although Harris claims his models are ""beautiful, healthy and intelligent,"" he offers no evidence of brains, such as IQ or SAT scores. London's Independent envisions ""Bimbo births."" A fertility expert shrugs, ""If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them."" 

          

            9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure capitalism, saying it's ""unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make money"" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of ""taking advantage of couples trying to conceive"" and exploiting ""desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell."" USA Today laments, ""This is about human need. And human greed."" 

          

            10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday, Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction. Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA Today described the models as ""struggling actresses,"" reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying, ""I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse ."" Harris' sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was ""better than prostitution."" 

         Harris constantly refers to the donors as his ""girls"" and describes them like cattle--""We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls."" He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures. ""We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items,"" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to ""find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on the Web."" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps like him have come away with the profit. 

          

            11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models), hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels.com is really aimed at ""adolescent boys."" 

          

            12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. ""Ever since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs,"" one fertility expert complains to the New York Times . USA Today says the egg auction ""just might force an Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the Internet taking us?"" 

          

            13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases. The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. ""When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,"" a computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that ""there's very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,"" and ""the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from."" 

          

            14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences. Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today show, Harris said of this theory, ""That's a pretty cynical view of human nature."") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples. 

          

            15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that ""having sex is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the next generation."" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words: ""our genes."" ""The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the [drive] to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site,"" Fisher observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself. 

          

            16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited. Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious response is to attack the whole ""prejudice"" in favor of beauty. ""The standards of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts, not really genetics facts,"" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, ""we should think about"" whether to ""accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them"" or to transcend those prejudices. 

         This critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start with the latter rather than the former? 

         Second, Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection. ""Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,"" he writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become more than material. At least, most of us have.

         This week, soft-porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion models on the Internet.

London's Independent envisions ""Bimbo births."" A fertility expert shrugs, ""If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them."" 

          

            9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure capitalism, saying it's ""unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make money"" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of ""taking advantage of couples trying to conceive"" and exploiting ""desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell."" USA Today laments, ""This is about human need. And human greed."" 

          

            10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday, Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction. Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA Today described the models as ""struggling actresses,"" reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying, ""I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse ."" Harris' sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was ""better than prostitution."" 

         Harris constantly refers to the donors as his ""girls"" and describes them like cattle--""We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls."" He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures. ""We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items,"" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to ""find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on the Web."" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps like him have come away with the profit. 

          

            11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models), hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels.com is really aimed at ""adolescent boys."" 

          

            12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. ""Ever since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs,"" one fertility expert complains to the New York Times . USA Today says the egg auction ""just might force an Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the Internet taking us?"" 

          

            13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases. The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. ""When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,"" a computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that ""there's very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,"" and ""the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from."" 

          

            14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences. Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today show, Harris said of this theory, ""That's a pretty cynical view of human nature."") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples. 

          

            15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that ""having sex is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the next generation."" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words: ""our genes."" ""The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the [drive] to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site,"" Fisher observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself. 

          

            16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited. Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious response is to attack the whole ""prejudice"" in favor of beauty. ""The standards of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts, not really genetics facts,"" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, ""we should think about"" whether to ""accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them"" or to transcend those prejudices. 

         This critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start with the latter rather than the former? 

         Second, Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection. ""Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,"" he writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become more than material. At least, most of us have.

28,"Eleven-Twelfths of 1999 In Review 

         When Chatterbox invited readers to nominate events, significant deaths, good and bad movies, etc., for 1999--a year likely to get little attention in the coming weeks, as news organizations choose instead to review the entire century or millennium--the response was overwhelming. Chatterbox had promised to publish his official ""1999 In Review"" item before Thanksgiving, but some distant memory of a scruple persuaded him to wait till November was over. Nothing ever happens in December. 

         OK, that's not quite true. Hordes of protesters in Seattle are making the World Trade Organization's meeting there a much more exciting TV story than anyone expected it to be. Reader Dan Crist (who finds Chatterbox's habit of referring to himself in the third person ""rather annoying and less than professional"") points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941. Also, Chatterbox (moonlighting as ""Today's Papers"" columnist) observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representatives cast its second presidential-impeachment vote in U.S. history on Dec. 19, 1998. (That same news-filled day, the U.S. ended an air war against Iraq and Bob Livingston said he'd decided not to become House speaker after all.) Two months after the impeachment vote, the Senate failed to convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for some bizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrote in to remind him of it. 

         By now, it should be clear that Chatterbox isn't much good at year-in-review journalism. Fortunately, Chatterbox's readers are very good at it. He will now turn this survey over to them. 

         ( Disclaimer: Although Chatterbox previously stated that he wouldn't include opinions he disagreed with, that standard proved too confining. Where Chatterbox has solid information or opinions to the contrary, he occasionally interjects below. Obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour reader comments were discarded, but if you don't find your nominee below it doesn't necessarily mean that it was obviously stupid or unnecessarily sour. ) 

         Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999: 

         1. Most Hated Celebrity--Ever?              

          

                                The New York Times reported on Nov. 10, 1999, that a new record had been set in the latest Times /CBS poll: [Its] highest negative rating ever scored by a person in the news. The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump, who managed to make an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled. The paper noted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negative rating--the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp. Presumably this came as no surprise to Mr. Trump, who, upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee on Oct. 7, 1999, had cited polls with ""amazing results""--a remark that was widely misinterpreted at the time.                 

            -- Jodie Allen of U.S. News &amp; World Report (and frequent 

                  Slate                    contributor) 

          

         2. Most Foolishly Ignored Parts of the World in 1999              

          

                               The dog that did bark but no one noticed--the political turmoil in the three great South Asian nations of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which now are well on the way to passing the three northern Asian nations of China, Japan, and Russia in population (Indonesia is fourth, Pakistan just passed Japan to seventh, India will soon pass China to first). But Americans are still fixated on northern Asia--Clinton says he must deal with China, because ""you can't ignore a billion people with nuclear weapons,"" but his own policy toward India shows that you sure can!                 

            --Jim Chapin 

          

         3. Worst/Best Films of 1999              

          

                               Here's my nominee for worst movie of the year (complete category should be: ""Worst Movie of the Year That Assumedly Adult Male Reviewers Slathered Over""):                    There's Something About Mary                   --a pathetically sophomoric, penis-obsessed mess that wouldn't even appeal to Larry Flynt!                 

            -- Felicia, Menlo Park, Cal. 

          

                         Chatterbox replies:              

          

                               You've got the wrong year. That was 1998 .                                    

          

         [Chatterbox didn't have the heart to add that he thought There's Something About Mary was pretty funny, especially the joke about ""the franks or the beans.""] 

                                            Felicia replies:              

          

                               Oops ... well then, the best of '99 was                    The Red Violin                   --lyrical, magical, musical, wonderful!                 

          

         [Chatterbox hasn't seen it.] 

         4. Most Shameless (and Unsuccessful) Attempt To Have It Both Ways in 1999 : 

          

                               Sen. Arlen Specter, citing Scottish law, finds Clinton ""not proven"" on the impeachment charges.                 

            --Andrew Solovay 

          

         5. Rest in Peace in 1999:              

          

                               Stanley Kubrick (multiple sources) 

                               John Kennedy Jr. (multiple sources)

                         6. 1999: The Road Not Taken              

          

                                What an extraordinary year! A right-wing conspiracy topples the president, and the governor of Texas reveals himself in a series of debates to be a natural leader with an innate gift for connecting with his audience, a sure sign of his electoral success next year. A new Thomas Harris book brilliantly takes us deeper into the mind of a serial killer; a new Star Wars movie redefines the very nature of entertainment; a new Stanley Kubrick film changes the whole national dialogue about sex and marriage; a new TV series from the creator of SportsNight --oh, I can't even bring myself to bash that piece of do-gooder twaddle. If only McDonald's had come out with three more boldly adult-flavored hamburgers, it would have been a perfect year for dud megaevents--all leading up of course to Y2K, the limpest milestone in human history.                 

            --Mike Gebert 

          

         7 . Children Behaving Badly in 1999              

          

                               Don't forget Woodstock 1999 --the concert of ""peace and love"" that ended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours-long tribute to the original Woodstock, the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else that would burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene. [ Chatterbox interjects: Didn't people get assaulted and raped, too?] I'm getting all sentimental just thinking about it.                 

            You also left out all the shooting rampages . Several were done in the name of God or love supposedly. They were all committed by ""quiet, shy"" people who ""mostly kept to"" themselves. I've started to hang around only loud, obnoxious people.                 

            --Susan Hoechstetter 

          

         8. A Lunatic Rhapsody for the                 New York Yankees              

          

                                The Yankees can actually be referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the 1999 World Series champions, they are a significant ""story of the year."" However, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader context.                 

            1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, by one, the most championships any one team won during the century. The Montreal Canadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team, playing in the ""City of the Century"" (so called by me to reflect the amazing growth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the ""National Pastime,"" are truly an amazing story. 

            The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25 of the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellence is not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win is possibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels of playoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, by winning three of the last four championships, they are the first team to accomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play. 

            The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, and Yogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport, and American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, and America's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature ""a name."" This team, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, and no star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax American interests, and the new political paradigm. 

          

         --Jim Landau from North Potomac, Md. (formerly of the Bronx) 

         9. A Big Shot Calls for Decriminalizing Drug Use in 1999              

          

                               New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition. Though this by itself has no immediate effect, it makes it respectable, for the first time, for political leaders to discuss the subject, and thereby brings closer the day when the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed, when billions of dollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people's lives, and when we will stop, as in Samuel Butler's                    Erewhon                   , imprisoning people for the crime of being sick.

                               The Dalai Lama proclaimed that most important thing in the world is to be happy.

                               Public interest and media attention to the women's World Cup in soccer.

         13. Policing the World Is Shown To Work in 1999              

          

                                I nominate as the most under-reported story of the year (and the last few years) the continuing alarmist predictions by foreign-policy and military experts about peacekeeping efforts, which are then proved wrong and immediately forgotten. This year, the obvious one is Kosovo, but the year is also ending with East Timor, where the Aussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with no casualties.                 

            These followed Haiti, Bosnia, and Rwanda as places where the West delayed sending in troops because of alarmist predictions.

                               A sitting president was accused of rape.                 

            --Ananda Gupta 

          

                         Chatterbox interjects: Yes, but the evidence was shaky--something the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page, which broke the story, was not very forthcoming about. As Jack Shafer wrote in this column, Ronald Reagan, after he left office, was also accused of having once committed rape. The evidence there was shaky, too. 

         17. The Most Important Thing of All That Happened in 1999              

          

                               In 1999, more than half of U.S. homes had a PC, for the first time (i.e., home-PC penetration passed 50 percent). Of course, most of these PCs crashed all the time, but it's still a significant development. By the way, Internet hookups in homes are still well below 50 percent.

Two months after the impeachment vote, the Senate failed to convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for some bizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrote in to remind him of it. 

         By now, it should be clear that Chatterbox isn't much good at year-in-review journalism. Fortunately, Chatterbox's readers are very good at it. He will now turn this survey over to them.

         Here are 20 important things that happened in 1999: 

         1. Most Hated Celebrity--Ever?              

          

                                The New York Times reported on Nov. 10, 1999, that a new record had been set in the latest Times /CBS poll: [Its] highest negative rating ever scored by a person in the news. The honor went to Reform Party candidate Donald Trump, who managed to make an unfavorable impression upon some 70 percent of those polled. The paper noted that this achievement far eclipsed the last comparably negative rating--the 55 percent score attained by Linda Tripp. Presumably this came as no surprise to Mr. Trump, who, upon announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee on Oct. 7, 1999, had cited polls with ""amazing results""--a remark that was widely misinterpreted at the time.

                               The dog that did bark but no one noticed--the political turmoil in the three great South Asian nations of India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, which now are well on the way to passing the three northern Asian nations of China, Japan, and Russia in population (Indonesia is fourth, Pakistan just passed Japan to seventh, India will soon pass China to first). But Americans are still fixated on northern Asia--Clinton says he must deal with China, because ""you can't ignore a billion people with nuclear weapons,"" but his own policy toward India shows that you sure can!

                         6. 1999: The Road Not Taken              

          

                                What an extraordinary year! A right-wing conspiracy topples the president, and the governor of Texas reveals himself in a series of debates to be a natural leader with an innate gift for connecting with his audience, a sure sign of his electoral success next year. A new Thomas Harris book brilliantly takes us deeper into the mind of a serial killer; a new Star Wars movie redefines the very nature of entertainment; a new Stanley Kubrick film changes the whole national dialogue about sex and marriage; a new TV series from the creator of SportsNight --oh, I can't even bring myself to bash that piece of do-gooder twaddle. If only McDonald's had come out with three more boldly adult-flavored hamburgers, it would have been a perfect year for dud megaevents--all leading up of course to Y2K, the limpest milestone in human history.

                               Don't forget Woodstock 1999 --the concert of ""peace and love"" that ended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours-long tribute to the original Woodstock, the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else that would burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene. [ Chatterbox interjects: Didn't people get assaulted and raped, too?] I'm getting all sentimental just thinking about it.                 

            You also left out all the shooting rampages . Several were done in the name of God or love supposedly. They were all committed by ""quiet, shy"" people who ""mostly kept to"" themselves. I've started to hang around only loud, obnoxious people.

         8. A Lunatic Rhapsody for the                 New York Yankees              

          

                                The Yankees can actually be referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the 1999 World Series champions, they are a significant ""story of the year."" However, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader context.                 

            1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, by one, the most championships any one team won during the century. The Montreal Canadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team, playing in the ""City of the Century"" (so called by me to reflect the amazing growth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the ""National Pastime,"" are truly an amazing story. 

            The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25 of the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellence is not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win is possibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels of playoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, by winning three of the last four championships, they are the first team to accomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play. 

            The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, and Yogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport, and American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, and America's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature ""a name."" This team, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, and no star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax American interests, and the new political paradigm.

         9. A Big Shot Calls for Decriminalizing Drug Use in 1999              

          

                               New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition. Though this by itself has no immediate effect, it makes it respectable, for the first time, for political leaders to discuss the subject, and thereby brings closer the day when the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed, when billions of dollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people's lives, and when we will stop, as in Samuel Butler's                    Erewhon                   , imprisoning people for the crime of being sick.

                                I nominate as the most under-reported story of the year (and the last few years) the continuing alarmist predictions by foreign-policy and military experts about peacekeeping efforts, which are then proved wrong and immediately forgotten. This year, the obvious one is Kosovo, but the year is also ending with East Timor, where the Aussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with no casualties.                 

            These followed Haiti, Bosnia, and Rwanda as places where the West delayed sending in troops because of alarmist predictions.

                         Chatterbox interjects: Yes, but the evidence was shaky--something the Wall Street Journal 's editorial page, which broke the story, was not very forthcoming about. As Jack Shafer wrote in this column, Ronald Reagan, after he left office, was also accused of having once committed rape. The evidence there was shaky, too.

                               In 1999, more than half of U.S. homes had a PC, for the first time (i.e., home-PC penetration passed 50 percent). Of course, most of these PCs crashed all the time, but it's still a significant development. By the way, Internet hookups in homes are still well below 50 percent.

                               The Senate rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , thereby decapitating nuclear-arms control and sending Iraq, Iran, and North Korea the message that the United States won't raise a big stink if they try to join India and Pakistan. The president woke up to this possibility at about the moment it was realized, and started lobbying for passage of the treaty a day after it became too late.

28,"Eleven-Twelfths of 1999 In Review 

         When Chatterbox invited readers to nominate events, significant deaths, good and bad movies, etc., for 1999--a year likely to get little attention in the coming weeks, as news organizations choose instead to review the entire century or millennium--the response was overwhelming. Chatterbox had promised to publish his official ""1999 In Review"" item before Thanksgiving, but some distant memory of a scruple persuaded him to wait till November was over. Nothing ever happens in December. 

         OK, that's not quite true. Hordes of protesters in Seattle are making the World Trade Organization's meeting there a much more exciting TV story than anyone expected it to be. Reader Dan Crist (who finds Chatterbox's habit of referring to himself in the third person ""rather annoying and less than professional"") points out that Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Dec. 1941. Also, Chatterbox (moonlighting as ""Today's Papers"" columnist) observed not quite one year ago that the House of Representatives cast its second presidential-impeachment vote in U.S. history on Dec. 19, 1998. (That same news-filled day, the U.S. ended an air war against Iraq and Bob Livingston said he'd decided not to become House speaker after all.) Two months after the impeachment vote, the Senate failed to convict the president--a highly significant event of 1999 that, for some bizarre reason, slipped Chatterbox's mind until several indignant readers wrote in to remind him of it.

If only McDonald's had come out with three more boldly adult-flavored hamburgers, it would have been a perfect year for dud megaevents--all leading up of course to Y2K, the limpest milestone in human history.

                               Don't forget Woodstock 1999 --the concert of ""peace and love"" that ended in a literal blaze of glory when in an hours-long tribute to the original Woodstock, the mob started ripping down vendor booths and anything else that would burn and piling it onto the bonfires scattered about the scene. [ Chatterbox interjects: Didn't people get assaulted and raped, too?] I'm getting all sentimental just thinking about it.

         8. A Lunatic Rhapsody for the                 New York Yankees              

          

                                The Yankees can actually be referred to as the glue that held the century together. Of course, as the 1999 World Series champions, they are a significant ""story of the year."" However, this one singular achievement must be considered in a broader context.                 

            1999 represented the team's 25th championship of the century. This beats, by one, the most championships any one team won during the century. The Montreal Canadiens have won 23 Stanley Cups. However, the Yankees, an American team, playing in the ""City of the Century"" (so called by me to reflect the amazing growth and transformation of one city during this period), who play the ""National Pastime,"" are truly an amazing story. 

            The team's first championship occurred in 1921; therefore, they have won 25 of the last 78 years, nearly one in three. This level of sustained excellence is not matched in sports or in any other aspect of society. The 1999 win is possibly the most unique. With free-agency, expansion, and three levels of playoffs, it is much harder to win today than in past years. In fact, by winning three of the last four championships, they are the first team to accomplish this feat during the eras of free-agency and of divisional play. 

            The Sultan of Swat, the Iron Man, the Yankee Clipper, the Mick, and Yogi--these strong, masculine names are synonymous with the team, the sport, and American history. They went hand in hand with two world wars, Superman, and America's superpower status. The 1999 squad does not feature ""a name."" This team, with its myriad of human-interest stories, its international roster, and no star, is representative of '90s man, male sensitivity, Pax American interests, and the new political paradigm.

                               New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson came out for ending drug prohibition. Though this by itself has no immediate effect, it makes it respectable, for the first time, for political leaders to discuss the subject, and thereby brings closer the day when the vast majority of crimes will no longer be committed, when billions of dollars will be freed to help the inner city instead of to ruin black people's lives, and when we will stop, as in Samuel Butler's                    Erewhon                   , imprisoning people for the crime of being sick.

This year, the obvious one is Kosovo, but the year is also ending with East Timor, where the Aussies and their allies successfully stopped the slaughter with no casualties.                 

            These followed Haiti, Bosnia, and Rwanda as places where the West delayed sending in troops because of alarmist predictions.

         Gambling's would-be federal regulators--the National Gambling Impact Study Commission--went to Las Vegas this week to hold hearings. In today's dispatch, we learn how gambling's foes seek to demonize wagering as a pernicious tobaccolike vice. In yesterday's dispatch, gambling's foes learn the folly of having brought their anti-sin crusade to an adult Disneyland. 

         Tuesday's overpowering show of force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effect on the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Wednesday, even commission Chair Kay Coles James, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous Vegas euphemism: She begins referring to the ""gaming industry."" 

         After Tuesday's casino triumphalism, Wednesday is a comedown, eight hours of policy panels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gambling marketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for the first time I sense that this commission--though divided, underfunded, timid, and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It may finally settle this question: Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco? Entertainment or vice? 

         The sleek Vegas types, whose Strip palaces scramble casinos, theaters, restaurants, arcades, discos, cabarets, theme parks, concert halls, sports arenas, and museums into one giant orgy of amusement, have been selling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--Disney in the desert. This effort has largely succeeded, because Vegas is still the dominant image of American gambling, if not the dominant reality. 

         The antis, meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for kids, viciously addictive, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unless mightily regulated. 

          Judging by today's hearings and by conversations with most of the commissioners, the tobacco model is winning. Today's panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble too young and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears to be increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed to addict customers, and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowing them to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors. The testimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impress the three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June 1999 report. 

         It is starting to become clear what that report will say. The commission won't (and can't) take any grand stand against gambling. Instead it will opt for small, targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probably propose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research and that casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering. The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment of pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to cover gambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers' access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos to remove the machines from their floors. 

         The commission will also push the industry to do more to prevent kids from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of Indian gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling, perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It will rebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a tobaccolike vice. 

         If the comments of the pro-industry commissioners can be believed, the industry will happily endorse such a report. Gamblers don't quite accept the cigarette analogy--though commission member Bill Bible, a former chief of the Nevada Gaming Commission, did concede that gambling was like alcohol--but they're happy to sign on to the specific measures. The casino industry is even trying to get ahead of the commission. It has already established a (mostly) independent center to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect that the industry will not only agree to the commission's recommendations but will become their strongest advocate. Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress and state legislatures to enact the recommendations into law. 

          Why should the pro-gamblers cooperate with a critical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes the problem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality rather than industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is also politically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblers, the casinos will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of their customers than with profits. 

         The cigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the true reasons for worry. A few years ago, gambling was confined to Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It is now thriving in 48 states, and there is no sign that anyone can stop it. In this election, gambling interests dropped $100 million on a single California ballot initiative, toppled governors in two states, and bought senators and representatives by the crate. What the commission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. 

         The antis can call gambling ""tobacco."" They can call it ""vice."" They can call it ""a big red balloon"" for all that the industry cares. As long as the commission just nibbles around the edges, the casino operators and state lotteries will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling folks will win credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts. The last national gambling commission was in the mid-1970s. If the gamblers play along with this commission's timid recommendations, they'll be safe for another 20 years. 

                         An Apology              

         I owe an apology to Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, whom I criticized yesterday for using the term ""Indian country"" during a speech critical of Indian casinos. As several readers pointed out to me, ""Indian country"" is a common phrase in the West and has no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, Senator. 

         Talk about quick defeats: The first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that the National Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost. The sign reads: ""National Gaming Impact Study Commission."" 

                         ""Gaming""?              

         In Las Vegas, the euphemizers reign. Once upon a time, the casino owners decided that ""gambling"" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So ""gambling"" disappeared in Las Vegas, and ""gaming"" has risen in its place. He who controls language controls ideas, and at today's commission hearing, it is perfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed into convenience stores--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling there is--are called ""retail gaming."" People who own casinos are not ""casino owners,"" they are ""gaming visionaries."" Pathological gamblers are ""problem gamers""--as if they're having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly. And the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact Study Commission. 

         The gambling industry did everything in its power to stop the establishment of this commission two years ago, but Congress and a fervent grassroots anti-gambling group eventually foisted it on the industry. The nine member blue-ribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economic impact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to Congress and the president in June 1999. Even though the panel was carefully balanced between pro- and anti-gambling leaders, it was supposed to be Vegas' nemesis. The industry and Las Vegas' pro-gambling media quaked in anticipation of the onerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend. 

         But they quake no more. Whatever national momentum the anti-gamblers had dissolved in last week's elections. The industry routed opponents in state after state. Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos. Californians voted to expand Indian casinos. In South Carolina and Alabama, voters expelled anti-lottery, anti-gambling Republican governors and replaced them with pro-lottery Democrats. The gambling industry spent more than $100 million on political contributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or more secure. 

         ""My goodness, no politician can withstand their resources,"" Focus on the Family's James Dobson, the commission's leading gambling opponent, tells me. The industry's political clout has emasculated the commission, Dobson continues: ""Our report won't be acted on by the president or Congress. They are too heavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the leaders of Congress are on the dole."" It has also become obvious that the commission has too many pro-gambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other real penalties on the industry. 

          So the commission's two day visit to Gomorrah has been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lap for gaming. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and the ""gaming visionaries"" have been planning for these hearings for months, hoping to use them to demonstrate the might and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry. 

         The MGM Grand, which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni, is itself the first exhibit of the Vegas triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that consumers, at least, have no problem with this business. The MGM Grand, a k a ""The City of Entertainment,"" has 5,000 rooms--the corridor outside my room is 200 yards long, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines, craps tables, and roulette wheels. David Cassidy performs here every night--twice! A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelming evidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote. New York, New York is just across the street, the $1.6 billion Bellagio is one door down, and a half-scale Eiffel Tower is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling folks no doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling opponents. I asked one anti-gambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks of it. She could only blurt out ""Wow."" 

         The hearings, too, reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas theme. Frank Fahrenkopf, the industry's top lobbyist (who is paid so much he can afford monogrammed shirt cuffs --I saw them), holds forth cheerfully outside the ballroom, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom over religious moralist tyranny. Inside, the room is packed with more than 600 people in neon lime green T-shirts that read ""Unions and Gaming: Together for a Better Life."" They are members of the major casino union, here to cheer on their employers and their union. (Most of them, it must be said, are getting paid to do this.) 

         Chairwoman Kay Coles James, a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling, opens the hearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless: ""We're not here to take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except make recommendations."" This sets the mood for most of the day: Vegas is great, so you'd better leave it alone! The local government, by all appearances a wholly owned subsidiary of the casinos, puts on a bravura performance. Gov. Miller opens the show with a 15 minute hymn to Las Vegas. It is the first of many statistical barrages about Nevada's one-ders: No. 1 in job growth, No. 1 in population growth, and No. 1 on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scout troops--and Boy Scout troops! 

          Later in the day, Nevada's senators and both its congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevada might have a dark side. They pay tribute to Nevada's sophisticated gambling industry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling states) and its use of gambling taxes to fund state services. It is one of the ironies of Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen (Jim Gibbons and John Ensign) end up crediting their state's success to government regulation and corporate taxation. 

         There are also a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators, bookmakers, and casino employees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears from. Critics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils of convenience store slot machines leaven the pro-gambling folks. Everyone, including the gambling industry shills, agrees that Internet gambling is evil and should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas is making any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure they would explain why it's as American as nickel slots and scratch-off games. 

         Pro-Vegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots at Indian gambling, the chief economic threat to Nevada's prosperity. The expansion of Indian casinos resulting from last week's California voter initiative will slam Las Vegas, cutting its gambling revenues by $400 million a year. So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in ""Indian country"" (that's Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan's term--I'm not joking) for being insufficiently regulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this ""red baiting."" 

         (Pause for an aesthetic observation: I am sitting right behind the witnesses, and after a while I begin to separate them into the Wides and the Narrows. The Wides are men in suits with enormous backs and enormous bellies, men who eat and eat and used to play football. They all testify to their love of gambling. The Narrows are thin and generally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gambling correlates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, and decide that they probably do.) 

         During the last hour of the day, the public comment period, the union sends a parade of casino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry. Housekeepers, cooks, and slot change girls, almost all black or Latina, tell the same story: I was working a dead-end job in another state, ""then I heard about Las Vegas, where there's opportunity!"" I moved here, landed a job at a union casino with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and ""now I am buying a house."" The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasive tribute to the Strip that I've ever heard. 

          Still, for all the Vegan triumphalism in the air, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent, the Rev. Tom Grey. Grey is utterly irrepressible. A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodist minister, Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling. He founded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the primary force behind the commission's creation. (Grey, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat, has just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, tacitly recognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth and shameless promoter of the cause. He wears a gigantic ""CasiNO"" button in the casino. He posed for People in a shepherd's robe. He says ""I would do anything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stop gambling."" He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of an oncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies. 

         He and his Las Vegas allies, a former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venture capitalist named Otis Harris, invite me on a tour of Las Vegas. ""Behind the Mirage,"" they call it. For two hours, we cruise the streets behind the casinos. They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from a youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heels casinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about how terrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas' prosperity is. 

         It's very grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and pass the jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGM Grand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey's task is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wants to do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of the Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.

Instead it will opt for small, targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probably propose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research and that casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering. The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment of pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to cover gambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers' access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos to remove the machines from their floors. 

         The commission will also push the industry to do more to prevent kids from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of Indian gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling, perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It will rebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a tobaccolike vice. 

         If the comments of the pro-industry commissioners can be believed, the industry will happily endorse such a report. Gamblers don't quite accept the cigarette analogy--though commission member Bill Bible, a former chief of the Nevada Gaming Commission, did concede that gambling was like alcohol--but they're happy to sign on to the specific measures. The casino industry is even trying to get ahead of the commission. It has already established a (mostly) independent center to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect that the industry will not only agree to the commission's recommendations but will become their strongest advocate. Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress and state legislatures to enact the recommendations into law. 

          Why should the pro-gamblers cooperate with a critical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes the problem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality rather than industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is also politically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblers, the casinos will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of their customers than with profits. 

         The cigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the true reasons for worry. A few years ago, gambling was confined to Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It is now thriving in 48 states, and there is no sign that anyone can stop it. In this election, gambling interests dropped $100 million on a single California ballot initiative, toppled governors in two states, and bought senators and representatives by the crate. What the commission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. 

         The antis can call gambling ""tobacco."" They can call it ""vice."" They can call it ""a big red balloon"" for all that the industry cares. As long as the commission just nibbles around the edges, the casino operators and state lotteries will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling folks will win credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts. The last national gambling commission was in the mid-1970s. If the gamblers play along with this commission's timid recommendations, they'll be safe for another 20 years. 

                         An Apology              

         I owe an apology to Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, whom I criticized yesterday for using the term ""Indian country"" during a speech critical of Indian casinos. As several readers pointed out to me, ""Indian country"" is a common phrase in the West and has no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, Senator. 

         Talk about quick defeats: The first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that the National Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost. The sign reads: ""National Gaming Impact Study Commission."" 

                         ""Gaming""?              

         In Las Vegas, the euphemizers reign. Once upon a time, the casino owners decided that ""gambling"" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So ""gambling"" disappeared in Las Vegas, and ""gaming"" has risen in its place. He who controls language controls ideas, and at today's commission hearing, it is perfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed into convenience stores--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling there is--are called ""retail gaming."" People who own casinos are not ""casino owners,"" they are ""gaming visionaries."" Pathological gamblers are ""problem gamers""--as if they're having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly. And the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact Study Commission. 

         The gambling industry did everything in its power to stop the establishment of this commission two years ago, but Congress and a fervent grassroots anti-gambling group eventually foisted it on the industry. The nine member blue-ribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economic impact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to Congress and the president in June 1999. Even though the panel was carefully balanced between pro- and anti-gambling leaders, it was supposed to be Vegas' nemesis. The industry and Las Vegas' pro-gambling media quaked in anticipation of the onerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend. 

         But they quake no more. Whatever national momentum the anti-gamblers had dissolved in last week's elections. The industry routed opponents in state after state. Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos. Californians voted to expand Indian casinos. In South Carolina and Alabama, voters expelled anti-lottery, anti-gambling Republican governors and replaced them with pro-lottery Democrats. The gambling industry spent more than $100 million on political contributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or more secure. 

         ""My goodness, no politician can withstand their resources,"" Focus on the Family's James Dobson, the commission's leading gambling opponent, tells me. The industry's political clout has emasculated the commission, Dobson continues: ""Our report won't be acted on by the president or Congress. They are too heavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the leaders of Congress are on the dole."" It has also become obvious that the commission has too many pro-gambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other real penalties on the industry. 

          So the commission's two day visit to Gomorrah has been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lap for gaming. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and the ""gaming visionaries"" have been planning for these hearings for months, hoping to use them to demonstrate the might and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry. 

         The MGM Grand, which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni, is itself the first exhibit of the Vegas triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that consumers, at least, have no problem with this business. The MGM Grand, a k a ""The City of Entertainment,"" has 5,000 rooms--the corridor outside my room is 200 yards long, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines, craps tables, and roulette wheels. David Cassidy performs here every night--twice! A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelming evidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote. New York, New York is just across the street, the $1.6 billion Bellagio is one door down, and a half-scale Eiffel Tower is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling folks no doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling opponents. I asked one anti-gambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks of it. She could only blurt out ""Wow."" 

         The hearings, too, reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas theme. Frank Fahrenkopf, the industry's top lobbyist (who is paid so much he can afford monogrammed shirt cuffs --I saw them), holds forth cheerfully outside the ballroom, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom over religious moralist tyranny. Inside, the room is packed with more than 600 people in neon lime green T-shirts that read ""Unions and Gaming: Together for a Better Life."" They are members of the major casino union, here to cheer on their employers and their union. (Most of them, it must be said, are getting paid to do this.) 

         Chairwoman Kay Coles James, a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling, opens the hearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless: ""We're not here to take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except make recommendations."" This sets the mood for most of the day: Vegas is great, so you'd better leave it alone! The local government, by all appearances a wholly owned subsidiary of the casinos, puts on a bravura performance. Gov. Miller opens the show with a 15 minute hymn to Las Vegas. It is the first of many statistical barrages about Nevada's one-ders: No. 1 in job growth, No. 1 in population growth, and No. 1 on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scout troops--and Boy Scout troops! 

          Later in the day, Nevada's senators and both its congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevada might have a dark side. They pay tribute to Nevada's sophisticated gambling industry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling states) and its use of gambling taxes to fund state services. It is one of the ironies of Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen (Jim Gibbons and John Ensign) end up crediting their state's success to government regulation and corporate taxation. 

         There are also a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators, bookmakers, and casino employees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears from. Critics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils of convenience store slot machines leaven the pro-gambling folks. Everyone, including the gambling industry shills, agrees that Internet gambling is evil and should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas is making any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure they would explain why it's as American as nickel slots and scratch-off games. 

         Pro-Vegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots at Indian gambling, the chief economic threat to Nevada's prosperity. The expansion of Indian casinos resulting from last week's California voter initiative will slam Las Vegas, cutting its gambling revenues by $400 million a year. So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in ""Indian country"" (that's Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan's term--I'm not joking) for being insufficiently regulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this ""red baiting."" 

         (Pause for an aesthetic observation: I am sitting right behind the witnesses, and after a while I begin to separate them into the Wides and the Narrows. The Wides are men in suits with enormous backs and enormous bellies, men who eat and eat and used to play football. They all testify to their love of gambling. The Narrows are thin and generally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gambling correlates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, and decide that they probably do.) 

         During the last hour of the day, the public comment period, the union sends a parade of casino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry. Housekeepers, cooks, and slot change girls, almost all black or Latina, tell the same story: I was working a dead-end job in another state, ""then I heard about Las Vegas, where there's opportunity!"" I moved here, landed a job at a union casino with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and ""now I am buying a house."" The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasive tribute to the Strip that I've ever heard. 

          Still, for all the Vegan triumphalism in the air, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent, the Rev. Tom Grey. Grey is utterly irrepressible. A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodist minister, Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling. He founded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the primary force behind the commission's creation. (Grey, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat, has just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, tacitly recognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth and shameless promoter of the cause. He wears a gigantic ""CasiNO"" button in the casino. He posed for People in a shepherd's robe. He says ""I would do anything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stop gambling."" He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of an oncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies. 

         He and his Las Vegas allies, a former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venture capitalist named Otis Harris, invite me on a tour of Las Vegas. ""Behind the Mirage,"" they call it. For two hours, we cruise the streets behind the casinos. They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from a youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heels casinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about how terrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas' prosperity is. 

         It's very grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and pass the jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGM Grand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey's task is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wants to do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of the Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.

         Gambling's would-be federal regulators--the National Gambling Impact Study Commission--went to Las Vegas this week to hold hearings. In today's dispatch, we learn how gambling's foes seek to demonize wagering as a pernicious tobaccolike vice. In yesterday's dispatch, gambling's foes learn the folly of having brought their anti-sin crusade to an adult Disneyland. 

         Tuesday's overpowering show of force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effect on the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Wednesday, even commission Chair Kay Coles James, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous Vegas euphemism: She begins referring to the ""gaming industry."" 

         After Tuesday's casino triumphalism, Wednesday is a comedown, eight hours of policy panels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gambling marketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for the first time I sense that this commission--though divided, underfunded, timid, and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It may finally settle this question: Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco? Entertainment or vice? 

         The sleek Vegas types, whose Strip palaces scramble casinos, theaters, restaurants, arcades, discos, cabarets, theme parks, concert halls, sports arenas, and museums into one giant orgy of amusement, have been selling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--Disney in the desert. This effort has largely succeeded, because Vegas is still the dominant image of American gambling, if not the dominant reality. 

         The antis, meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for kids, viciously addictive, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unless mightily regulated. 

          Judging by today's hearings and by conversations with most of the commissioners, the tobacco model is winning. Today's panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble too young and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears to be increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed to addict customers, and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowing them to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors. The testimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impress the three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June 1999 report. 

         It is starting to become clear what that report will say. The commission won't (and can't) take any grand stand against gambling.

It will probably propose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research and that casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering. The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment of pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to cover gambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers' access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos to remove the machines from their floors. 

         The commission will also push the industry to do more to prevent kids from gambling. It will call for heavier regulation of Indian gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling, perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It will rebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a tobaccolike vice. 

         If the comments of the pro-industry commissioners can be believed, the industry will happily endorse such a report. Gamblers don't quite accept the cigarette analogy--though commission member Bill Bible, a former chief of the Nevada Gaming Commission, did concede that gambling was like alcohol--but they're happy to sign on to the specific measures. The casino industry is even trying to get ahead of the commission. It has already established a (mostly) independent center to fund research into pathological gambling. I suspect that the industry will not only agree to the commission's recommendations but will become their strongest advocate. Casino owners will avidly lobby Congress and state legislatures to enact the recommendations into law. 

          Why should the pro-gamblers cooperate with a critical study? Because it provides superb cover for them. It medicalizes the problem of compulsive gambling, blaming it on psychological abnormality rather than industry machination. Likewise, cracking down on compulsives is also politically cost-effective. In exchange for losing a few compulsive gamblers, the casinos will (falsely) appear more concerned with the health of their customers than with profits. 

         The cigarette agenda will also distract the commission and the public from the true reasons for worry. A few years ago, gambling was confined to Las Vegas and Atlantic City. It is now thriving in 48 states, and there is no sign that anyone can stop it. In this election, gambling interests dropped $100 million on a single California ballot initiative, toppled governors in two states, and bought senators and representatives by the crate. What the commission ought to be investigating is whether the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. But it can't, because the gambling industry has become so powerful that it's politically untouchable. 

         The antis can call gambling ""tobacco."" They can call it ""vice."" They can call it ""a big red balloon"" for all that the industry cares. As long as the commission just nibbles around the edges, the casino operators and state lotteries will be happy to indulge it. The pro-gambling folks will win credit for cooperating, without having to do anything that really hurts. The last national gambling commission was in the mid-1970s. If the gamblers play along with this commission's timid recommendations, they'll be safe for another 20 years. 

                         An Apology              

         I owe an apology to Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan, whom I criticized yesterday for using the term ""Indian country"" during a speech critical of Indian casinos. As several readers pointed out to me, ""Indian country"" is a common phrase in the West and has no derogatory connotations. I'm sorry, Senator. 

         Talk about quick defeats: The first sign I see outside the MGM Grand ballroom all but declares that the National Gambling Impact Study Commission has already lost. The sign reads: ""National Gaming Impact Study Commission."" 

                         ""Gaming""?              

         In Las Vegas, the euphemizers reign. Once upon a time, the casino owners decided that ""gambling"" was too crude, too avaricious, to describe their fair business. So ""gambling"" disappeared in Las Vegas, and ""gaming"" has risen in its place. He who controls language controls ideas, and at today's commission hearing, it is perfectly clear who controls the language. Video slot machines crammed into convenience stores--perhaps the most pernicious form of legal gambling there is--are called ""retail gaming."" People who own casinos are not ""casino owners,"" they are ""gaming visionaries."" Pathological gamblers are ""problem gamers""--as if they're having trouble mastering the rules of Monopoly. And the National Gambling Impact Study Commission is reborn as the National Gaming Impact Study Commission. 

         The gambling industry did everything in its power to stop the establishment of this commission two years ago, but Congress and a fervent grassroots anti-gambling group eventually foisted it on the industry. The nine member blue-ribbon panel was charged with assessing the social and economic impact of gambling, and it will issue a final report to Congress and the president in June 1999. Even though the panel was carefully balanced between pro- and anti-gambling leaders, it was supposed to be Vegas' nemesis. The industry and Las Vegas' pro-gambling media quaked in anticipation of the onerous regulations and taxes the commission might recommend. 

         But they quake no more. Whatever national momentum the anti-gamblers had dissolved in last week's elections. The industry routed opponents in state after state. Missouri voters passed a ballot initiative to allow boat casinos. Californians voted to expand Indian casinos. In South Carolina and Alabama, voters expelled anti-lottery, anti-gambling Republican governors and replaced them with pro-lottery Democrats. The gambling industry spent more than $100 million on political contributions and issue ads. It has never been fatter, happier, or more secure. 

         ""My goodness, no politician can withstand their resources,"" Focus on the Family's James Dobson, the commission's leading gambling opponent, tells me. The industry's political clout has emasculated the commission, Dobson continues: ""Our report won't be acted on by the president or Congress. They are too heavily influenced by gambling money. Almost all the leaders of Congress are on the dole."" It has also become obvious that the commission has too many pro-gambling members to produce a report that recommends taxes or other real penalties on the industry. 

          So the commission's two day visit to Gomorrah has been transformed from a charged political event to a kind of victory lap for gaming. Nevada Gov. Bob Miller and the ""gaming visionaries"" have been planning for these hearings for months, hoping to use them to demonstrate the might and sanctity and goodness of the Nevada gambling industry. 

         The MGM Grand, which is run by commission member Terrence Lanni, is itself the first exhibit of the Vegas triumphalists. It is gaudy testimony that consumers, at least, have no problem with this business. The MGM Grand, a k a ""The City of Entertainment,"" has 5,000 rooms--the corridor outside my room is 200 yards long, so long I can't see its end--to feed the endless supply of slot machines, craps tables, and roulette wheels. David Cassidy performs here every night--twice! A few steps outside on the Strip is still more overwhelming evidence that Las Vegas has won the popular vote. New York, New York is just across the street, the $1.6 billion Bellagio is one door down, and a half-scale Eiffel Tower is going up next door. The setting has, as the pro-gambling folks no doubt hoped, stunned some of the gambling opponents. I asked one anti-gambling activist who had never before been to Vegas what she thinks of it. She could only blurt out ""Wow."" 

         The hearings, too, reinforce the Glorious Las Vegas theme. Frank Fahrenkopf, the industry's top lobbyist (who is paid so much he can afford monogrammed shirt cuffs --I saw them), holds forth cheerfully outside the ballroom, celebrating the electoral triumph of freedom over religious moralist tyranny. Inside, the room is packed with more than 600 people in neon lime green T-shirts that read ""Unions and Gaming: Together for a Better Life."" They are members of the major casino union, here to cheer on their employers and their union. (Most of them, it must be said, are getting paid to do this.) 

         Chairwoman Kay Coles James, a Christian conservative and skeptic of gambling, opens the hearing by assuring the crowd that the committee is toothless: ""We're not here to take anyone's job. ... We have no power to do anything except make recommendations."" This sets the mood for most of the day: Vegas is great, so you'd better leave it alone! The local government, by all appearances a wholly owned subsidiary of the casinos, puts on a bravura performance. Gov. Miller opens the show with a 15 minute hymn to Las Vegas. It is the first of many statistical barrages about Nevada's one-ders: No. 1 in job growth, No. 1 in population growth, and No. 1 on planet Earth in per capita Girl Scout troops--and Boy Scout troops! 

          Later in the day, Nevada's senators and both its congressmen appear to chew out the commission for even thinking that Nevada might have a dark side. They pay tribute to Nevada's sophisticated gambling industry, especially its regulation (much stricter than other gambling states) and its use of gambling taxes to fund state services. It is one of the ironies of Nevada politics that its Republican congressmen (Jim Gibbons and John Ensign) end up crediting their state's success to government regulation and corporate taxation. 

         There are also a fair share of gleeful gambling regulators, bookmakers, and casino employees among the panels of expert witnesses the commission hears from. Critics who gripe about the perils of sports gambling and the evils of convenience store slot machines leaven the pro-gambling folks. Everyone, including the gambling industry shills, agrees that Internet gambling is evil and should be destroyed. Everyone agrees to this because no one in Las Vegas is making any money off Internet gambling. If they were, you can be sure they would explain why it's as American as nickel slots and scratch-off games. 

         Pro-Vegas forces are also perfectly happy to take shots at Indian gambling, the chief economic threat to Nevada's prosperity. The expansion of Indian casinos resulting from last week's California voter initiative will slam Las Vegas, cutting its gambling revenues by $400 million a year. So the Vegans repeatedly swing at casinos in ""Indian country"" (that's Nevada Sen. Richard Bryan's term--I'm not joking) for being insufficiently regulated and taxed. One tribal chief I spoke to calls this ""red baiting."" 

         (Pause for an aesthetic observation: I am sitting right behind the witnesses, and after a while I begin to separate them into the Wides and the Narrows. The Wides are men in suits with enormous backs and enormous bellies, men who eat and eat and used to play football. They all testify to their love of gambling. The Narrows are thin and generally disapprove of it. I begin to wonder whether fondness for gambling correlates with general indulgence, and dislike correlates with asceticism, and decide that they probably do.) 

         During the last hour of the day, the public comment period, the union sends a parade of casino employees to the microphone to hallelujah the gaming industry. Housekeepers, cooks, and slot change girls, almost all black or Latina, tell the same story: I was working a dead-end job in another state, ""then I heard about Las Vegas, where there's opportunity!"" I moved here, landed a job at a union casino with high pay, free medical insurance, a pension, and ""now I am buying a house."" The stories are intensely moving, by far the most persuasive tribute to the Strip that I've ever heard. 

          Still, for all the Vegan triumphalism in the air, it's impossible not to be charmed by the chief gambling opponent, the Rev. Tom Grey. Grey is utterly irrepressible. A Vietnam rifleman turned Methodist minister, Grey has spent the last eight years evangelizing against gambling. He founded the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, the primary force behind the commission's creation. (Grey, in a rare acknowledgement of defeat, has just renamed it the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, tacitly recognizing that gambling is here to stay.) He is a genial motormouth and shameless promoter of the cause. He wears a gigantic ""CasiNO"" button in the casino. He posed for People in a shepherd's robe. He says ""I would do anything short of lighting myself on fire in the Capitol rotunda to stop gambling."" He is so excitable that I have to yank him out of the way of an oncoming car when he gets too wrapped up in one of his soliloquies. 

         He and his Las Vegas allies, a former Las Vegas city councilman named Steve Miller and an inner city venture capitalist named Otis Harris, invite me on a tour of Las Vegas. ""Behind the Mirage,"" they call it. For two hours, we cruise the streets behind the casinos. They show me all the evidence of gambling blight you'd never want to see, from a youth-center-turned-crack-house to pawn shops to sex shops to down at heels casinos to quickie motels. All the while, they keep up a patter about how terrible a neighbor the casino industry is and how superficial Las Vegas' prosperity is. 

         It's very grim and mostly persuasive. Still, when we turn back on to the Strip, and pass the jaw-dropping Stratosphere and Circus Circus and Bellagio and the MGM Grand--a 30 story tower bathed in fabulous emerald light, I realize why Grey's task is hopeless here. He is committing the cardinal sin of Vegas. All he wants to do is talk about losers. In Las Vegas, under the thrilling lights of the Strip, no one wants to hear about losers. In the land of gaming, not gambling, everyone is sure he's a winner.

         Gambling's would-be federal regulators--the National Gambling Impact Study Commission--went to Las Vegas this week to hold hearings. In today's dispatch, we learn how gambling's foes seek to demonize wagering as a pernicious tobaccolike vice. In yesterday's dispatch, gambling's foes learn the folly of having brought their anti-sin crusade to an adult Disneyland. 

         Tuesday's overpowering show of force by the Nevada gambling aristocracy has had at least one audible effect on the National Gambling Impact Study Commission. Wednesday, even commission Chair Kay Coles James, a gambling skeptic, succumbs to the hideous Vegas euphemism: She begins referring to the ""gaming industry."" 

         After Tuesday's casino triumphalism, Wednesday is a comedown, eight hours of policy panels on teen gambling, compulsive gambling, gambling regulation, gambling marketing, and gambling credit practices. It is tough slogging, but for the first time I sense that this commission--though divided, underfunded, timid, and without any power beyond exhortation--isn't entirely useless. It may finally settle this question: Is gambling Hollywood or tobacco? Entertainment or vice? 

         The sleek Vegas types, whose Strip palaces scramble casinos, theaters, restaurants, arcades, discos, cabarets, theme parks, concert halls, sports arenas, and museums into one giant orgy of amusement, have been selling the idea that gambling is just entertainment--Disney in the desert. This effort has largely succeeded, because Vegas is still the dominant image of American gambling, if not the dominant reality. 

         The antis, meanwhile, cry that gambling is like cigarettes: unsafe for kids, viciously addictive, deceptively marketed, unhealthy, expensive, and unacceptable unless mightily regulated. 

          Judging by today's hearings and by conversations with most of the commissioners, the tobacco model is winning. Today's panelists tell the commission that kids are starting to gamble too young and are getting addicted too easily, that compulsive gambling appears to be increasing as gambling spreads, that gambling marketing may be designed to addict customers, and that the industry exploits problem gamblers by allowing them to draw repeated credit card advances from ATMs on casino floors. The testimony clearly impresses the commissioners and seems especially to impress the three nonaligned commissioners who will be the swing votes on the June 1999 report. 

         It is starting to become clear what that report will say. The commission won't (and can't) take any grand stand against gambling. Instead it will opt for small, targeted policies, concentrating on compulsive gambling. It will probably propose that casinos and state lotteries fund gambling-addiction research and that casinos take much stronger measures to bar problem gamblers from wagering. The commission may recommend that gaming taxes be used to underwrite treatment of pathological gamblers and that insurance companies be encouraged to cover gambling addiction. Similarly, the commission will try to reduce gamblers' access to cash by limiting the size of ATM advances and prodding casinos to remove the machines from their floors.

It will call for heavier regulation of Indian gambling and will probably try to ban or severely regulate Internet gambling, perhaps by forbidding gambling companies from running online casinos. It will rebuke state lotteries for their deceptive marketing and will try to force them to post odds and stop targeting the poor. In short, it will treat gambling as a tobaccolike vice.

30,"Republican Shakeout 

         This weekend's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, kicked off the 2000 presidential race and sorted out the Republican field. Everyone agrees that George W. Bush is the front-runner, that Steve Forbes is in second place, and that Dan Quayle, who finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander, will soon join Alexander on the sidelines. But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in third and fourth--Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer--and the one who skipped Ames, John McCain. For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race. 

                         Elizabeth Dole              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top three. Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press , Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had cracked ""the top three."" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames as a horse race (""win, place, and show"") and noting that ""no one's ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three"" at Ames. Newspapers, cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a ""solid third"" and a place among the leaders by crossing the ""double-digit"" threshold. As Fox News' Carl Cameron put it: ""The other seven candidates could not crack double digits."" 

          

            2. Race for third. Since Bush and Forbes were expected to finish first and second, many pundits concluded, as Lisa Myers put it on Meet the Press , that ""the real race here was for third. Elizabeth Dole won that."" The Boston Globe called Dole ""the winner of this contest-within-the-contest."" Dole touted her ""victory"" on every talk show and cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release. At a news conference, an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll's ""real winner."" 

          

            3. Underdog. In every TV interview, Dole claimed to have been ""outspent by millions of dollars."" Her spokesman told reporters that ""on a dollar-per-vote basis, Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve Forbes."" Reporters love an underdog. ""From a strict cost-benefit standpoint, the big winner may be Elizabeth Dole,"" concluded Time . 

          

            4. Comeback kid. Dismissive coverage of Dole before the straw poll played to her advantage, as everyone marveled at her ""surprisingly"" strong third. ""Dole Revived,"" the Washington Post 's front page proclaimed. On This Week , George Will conceded, ""There had been a lot of very skeptical stories about whether her people would show up. She, therefore, I think, is the biggest winner."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Race for second. Forbes wants to fast-forward the GOP tournament to a finals bracket: Bush vs. Forbes. To prevent this, Dole needs to create a semifinal playoff--Forbes vs. Dole--to determine who gets to play Bush. Despite Forbes' huge financial advantage, ""we finished close to second,"" Dole told reporters Saturday night. ""This is going to become a two-person race."" The press agreed. ""Forbes had growing hopes ... that he might upset Bush or finish a close second,"" recalled the Post . Instead, ""he finished closer to Dole than to Bush."" 

          

            2. Experience. Having narrowed the field to three, Dole needs to focus the contest on criteria that favor her. The first of these is political experience, of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none. On every talk show, Dole vowed ""to demonstrate that the candidate with the most experience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money. ... We're talking about president of the United States."" 

          

            3. Gender. This is the more obvious criterion that distinguishes Dole. She hardly needs to mention it--the media bring it up anyway--but she invokes it subtly, alluding (as she did on two Sunday talk shows) to ""women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake my hand, a woman they dare to believe in."" Newspapers hail Dole's female followers as evidence ""that she can attract new voters to the GOP."" 

                         Gary Bauer              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top four. Like Dole, Bauer needed to crack the top tier and seal off the pack. Since sports analogies tend to cut off the top tier at three rather than four (e.g., ""bronze medal,"" ""win, place, and show""), Bauer changed metaphors, telling reporters that he had reached ""the first rung of candidates"" and that lower finishers might soon perish. On Meet the Press , he called himself the ""breakout candidate."" While some pundits lumped Bauer with the winners, others offered him the next best position--""leading the rest of the pack""--or at least distinguished him from the ""losers."" 

          

            2. Social conservative quarterfinal. This was Bauer's big spin win. Like Dole, he won a crucial ""contest-within-the-contest."" His scant margin over Pat Buchanan--8.9 percent to 7.3 percent--became a huge factor in the post-poll analysis. Pundits concluded that Bauer ""did what he had to do ... beat Pat Buchanan,"" and therefore ""can legitimately say he is the candidate of the Christian right,"" establishing himself as ""one of the winners,"" the ""three or four"" candidates who ""got their tickets punched"" to stay in the race. Talk show hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whether Buchanan was finished. 

          

            3. Conservative semifinal. Having scored well ahead of Bauer and Buchanan, Forbes anointed himself ""the conservative in a two-man race"" against Bush. Bauer disagreed, and the media took his side. ""Forbes, Bauer Battle for Right,"" the Post proclaimed, concluding that because Forbes failed to break away, ""he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and tough fight for the leadership of the conservative wing."" 

          

            4. Underdog. Bauer couldn't claim to be more strapped than Dole, so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognition, inexperience, and working-class heritage. ""I am running against some big bios ... the son of a former president, the son of a tycoon, and the wife of a senator,"" Bauer argued on Late Edition . ""I have never run for president or office before. And yet here we come in fourth place."" Newsweek 's David Brooks wrote that Bauer ""overcame his own financial disadvantages"" and joined Dole as the two surviving ""Have-Not candidates."" 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Buchanan will defect. Since Buchanan's combativeness and loyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate, his rivals have persuaded the media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his low score at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party. The more Buchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism, the more he plays into this scenario. 

          

            2. Populism. With Buchanan out of the way, Bauer will go after Forbes. When asked on television about Forbes' claim to represent the right. Bauer cited Forbes' wealth and called himself ""the son of a maintenance man."" On This Week , George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer ""is becoming the populist in the race,"" noting that Bauer's supporters ""love the fact that he was the son of a janitor."" 

          

            3. Conservatism. If Bauer wins the social conservative quarterfinal and the conservative semifinal, he gets to run as the ""Reagan"" candidate against ""Bush-Gore"" moderation on abortion, Hollywood, China, and other hot-button issues. This bracket-by-bracket tournament strategy reduces Bauer's obstacles from three candidates to two. He can target Forbes, knowing that if he prevails, either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in the moderate semifinal. Indeed, Dole's success at Ames arguably helps Bauer by giving Bush a semifinal contest.

            Playback              

          

            1. Ames meant nothing to him. Despite having skipped the straw poll, McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sunday to discuss it. ""If you're going to be taken seriously,"" Brit Hume asked him, ""don't you have to face up to the fact, when all the other candidates decide that an event is worth attending ... that maybe you've got to play too?"" In reply, McCain repeatedly called Ames ""meaningless."" His chutzpah bowled over the pundits. Stephanopoulos called McCain's no-show ""a pretty smart move"" and portrayed the 83 votes he won in the straw poll--putting him in last place among active Republican candidates--as evidence of his strength. 

          

            2. Ames meant death for others. Noting that McCain had bypassed the event, Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he, too, ""almost took a pass on this. It wasn't until George Bush said he was going to participate that then I said, 'OK, we've got to do it,' out of respect to the Iowa Republican Party."" The result, Quayle pleaded, was that he lost to candidates who had been in Iowa ""years and months."" McCain, explaining his decision to stay out, espoused a less sentimental philosophy: ""You always want to fight on ground that is most favorable to you."" For this, the media executed Quayle and spared McCain. ""Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone, but I think McCain is still in,"" concluded NPR's Mara Liasson. Ames was Vietnam in reverse: McCain ducked the fight, and Quayle took the beating. 

          

            3. Viability. ""Once the dust has settled from the straw poll,"" McCain regally announced, ""I will review the new political landscape"" and begin ""engaging the other Republican candidates."" Why does McCain get a bye? Because he has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in New Hampshire, South Carolina, and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire later. Newsweek , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , and several TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable, wasn't hurt by Ames, and may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush. 

          

            4. Vote-buying. To undermine the straw poll's authority as an arbiter of his candidacy, McCain called it a ""fund-raiser,"" ""a sham and a joke"" in which campaigns spent ""millions"" to ""buy"" votes. ""My campaign theme is to try to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence of special interests,"" he argued on Fox News Sunday . Brit Hume's retort--""that this whole process isn't quite pure enough for you""--played right into McCain's hands. McCain doesn't need to persuade the media that his reasons for skipping Ames were morally sound. He just needs to persuade them that his reasons were moral rather than political. 

          

            Playbook              

          

            1. Real votes. The vote-buying complaint only gets McCain a bye on the straw poll. To get another bye on February's Iowa caucuses, he'll rely on two other moral arguments. First, he'll claim that caucuses aren't ""real votes."" ""We'll have real votes in New Hampshire,"" McCain argued on Fox News Sunday . ""That's where real people are motivated to vote."" On Face the Nation , he suggested that he would focus on ""the genuine balloting process, which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina."" 

          

            2. Ethanol. Many pundits, fancying themselves shrewd, suggest that McCain's true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has ""taken a position on ethanol subsidies that's unpalatable to voters in Iowa."" On This Week , Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might ""have to do something dramatic,"" such as ""make a stand and say, 'We're not going to compete in Iowa. We think these ethanol subsidies are an abomination.' "" This is McCain's greatest triumph: He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculations and accusing him instead of principle. ""I've taken a lot of unpopular positions,"" he conceded on Fox News Sunday . 

          

            3. Experience. The longer McCain stays out of the race without damaging his credibility, the more the field narrows to his advantage. Alexander and Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, are already gone. Quayle and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, won't be far behind. If the field dwindles to Bush, Forbes, and Bauer, McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder running against Bush. But Dole's third-place finish at Ames, coupled with her victory in the post-Ames spin contest, complicates this plan. 

         So here's how the race shapes up. Bauer will frame it as a populist showdown, chiefly between himself and Forbes. Forbes will frame it as a fight between the establishment, led by Bush, and conservatives, led by himself. Dole will exploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes, pitching herself as the candidate of change, civility, and moral renewal. And McCain will fortify his war chest while his rivals battle and bleed. Ames has organized the contestants. Let the games begin.

         This weekend's straw poll in Ames, Iowa, kicked off the 2000 presidential race and sorted out the Republican field. Everyone agrees that George W. Bush is the front-runner, that Steve Forbes is in second place, and that Dan Quayle, who finished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander, will soon join Alexander on the sidelines. But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came in third and fourth--Elizabeth Dole and Gary Bauer--and the one who skipped Ames, John McCain. For these three, the post-game spin contest is crucial. Here's a playback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at their playbook of messages for the remainder of the race. 

                         Elizabeth Dole              

          

            Playback              

          

            1. Top three. Dole needed to get within striking distance of Bush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her. On Meet the Press , Face the Nation , and Late Edition , she boasted that she had cracked ""the top three."" Pundits bought the three-winners line, treating Ames as a horse race (""win, place, and show"") and noting that ""no one's ever won the Republican nomination without finishing in the top three"" at Ames. Newspapers, cramped for space, confined their headlines to Bush, Forbes, and Dole. Though Dole's 14 percent was closer to Bauer's 9 than to Forbes' 21, she earned a ""solid third"" and a place among the leaders by crossing the ""double-digit"" threshold. As Fox News' Carl Cameron put it: ""The other seven candidates could not crack double digits."" 

          

            2. Race for third. Since Bush and Forbes were expected to finish first and second, many pundits concluded, as Lisa Myers put it on Meet the Press , that ""the real race here was for third. Elizabeth Dole won that."" The Boston Globe called Dole ""the winner of this contest-within-the-contest."" Dole touted her ""victory"" on every talk show and cited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release. At a news conference, an aide introduced Dole as the straw poll's ""real winner."" 

          

            3. Underdog. In every TV interview, Dole claimed to have been ""outspent by millions of dollars.""

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .) 

          

                         2.                 Philosophy. The first round of testing was All Lager. This second round was All Fancy, and Mainly Not Lager. As several correspondents (for instance, the of Best American Beers ) have helpfully pointed out, the definition of lager provided last time was not exactly ""accurate."" If you want to stay within the realm of textbook definitions, a lager is a beer brewed a particular way--slowly, at cool temperatures, with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat. This is in contrast with an ale, which is brewed faster, warmer, and with the yeast on top. By this same reasoning, lagers don't have to be light-colored, weak-flavored, and watery, as mainstream American lagers are. In principle, lagers can be dark, fierce, manly. Therefore, the correspondents suggest, it was wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Pete's Wicked for deceptive labeling, in presenting their tawnier, more flavorful beers as lagers too. 

         To this the beer scientist must say: Book-learning is fine in its place. But let's be realistic. Actual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a) all cheap beers are lagers; and b) most lagers are light-colored and weak. The first test was designed to evaluate low-end beers and therefore had to be lager-centric. This one is designed to test fancy beers--but in the spirit of open-mindedness and technical accuracy, it includes a few ""strong"" lagers too. 

                         3. 

            Materials. The 10 test beers were chosen with several goals in mind: 

          

            To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer types--extra special bitter, India pale ale, Hefeweizen, and so on. 

            To include both imported and domestic beers. Among the domestic microbrews, there's an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest. But as Microsoft would put it, that's a feature not a bug. These beers all came from the Safeway nearest the Redmond, Wash., ""main campus"" of Microsoft, and microbrews are supposed to be local. 

            To include one holdover from the previous test, as a scientific control on our tasters' preferences. This was Sam Adams , runaway winner of Round 1. 

            To include one fancy product from a monster-scale U.S. mass brewery, to see if the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews. This was Michelob Hefeweizen , from the pride of St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch. 

          

         Click for pricing information and pre-quaffing evaluations. The beers tasted were: 

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

                         4. Data Analysis.              

                         a)                 Best and Worst. Compared to the lager test, we would expect the range of ""best"" choices to be more varied, since all the tested beers were supposed to be good. This expectation was most dramatically borne out in the ""Best and Worst"" rankings. 

         The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votes and 11.5 Best votes. (Tester No. 1 turned in a sheet with three Best selections, or two more than his theoretical quota. Tester No. 4 listed a Best and a Best-minus, which counted as half a vote.) 

          The results were clearest at the bottom: three Worsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen , even though most comments about the beer were more or less respectful. (""Bitter, drinkable."") But at the top and middle the situation was muddier: 

           

         There were three Bests for Full Sail ESB , which most of the tasters later said they weren't familiar with, and 2.5 for Redhook IPA , which all the tasters knew. But each of these also got a Worst vote, and most of the other beers had a mixed reading. So far, the tasters are meeting expectations, finding something to like in nearly all these fancy beers. 

                         b)                 Overall preference points. Here the complications increase. The loser was again apparent: Pyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points, as it had in the Best/Worst derby. But the amazing dark horse winner was Michelob Hefeweizen . The three elements of surprise here, in ascending order of unexpectedness, are: 

          

            This best-liked beer belonged to the same category, Hefeweizen, as the least-liked product, from Pyramid. 

            This was also the only outright Anheuser-Busch product in the contest (the Redhooks are 75 percent A-B free). It is safe to say that all tasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrew last, and Anheuser-Busch last of all. 

            Although it clearly won on overall preference points, Michelob Hefeweizen was the only beer not to have received a single ""Best"" vote. 

          

         The first two anomalies can be written off as testament to the power of a blind taste test. The third suggests an important difference in concepts of ""bestness."" Sometimes a product seems to be the best of a group simply because it's the most unusual or distinctive. This is why very high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly taste odd. But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive, day-in day-out acceptability. That seems to be Michelob Hefe 's achievement here: no one's first choice, but high on everyone's list. Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch. 

            Remember to stay strictly in the scientist's role. Don't take the test yourself.

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .)

You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch. 

            Remember to stay strictly in the scientist's role. Don't take the test yourself.

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .) 

          

                         2.                 Philosophy. The first round of testing was All Lager. This second round was All Fancy, and Mainly Not Lager. As several correspondents (for instance, the of Best American Beers ) have helpfully pointed out, the definition of lager provided last time was not exactly ""accurate."" If you want to stay within the realm of textbook definitions, a lager is a beer brewed a particular way--slowly, at cool temperatures, with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat. This is in contrast with an ale, which is brewed faster, warmer, and with the yeast on top. By this same reasoning, lagers don't have to be light-colored, weak-flavored, and watery, as mainstream American lagers are. In principle, lagers can be dark, fierce, manly. Therefore, the correspondents suggest, it was wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Pete's Wicked for deceptive labeling, in presenting their tawnier, more flavorful beers as lagers too. 

         To this the beer scientist must say: Book-learning is fine in its place. But let's be realistic. Actual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a) all cheap beers are lagers; and b) most lagers are light-colored and weak. The first test was designed to evaluate low-end beers and therefore had to be lager-centric. This one is designed to test fancy beers--but in the spirit of open-mindedness and technical accuracy, it includes a few ""strong"" lagers too. 

                         3. 

            Materials. The 10 test beers were chosen with several goals in mind: 

          

            To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer types--extra special bitter, India pale ale, Hefeweizen, and so on. 

            To include both imported and domestic beers. Among the domestic microbrews, there's an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest. But as Microsoft would put it, that's a feature not a bug. These beers all came from the Safeway nearest the Redmond, Wash., ""main campus"" of Microsoft, and microbrews are supposed to be local. 

            To include one holdover from the previous test, as a scientific control on our tasters' preferences. This was Sam Adams , runaway winner of Round 1. 

            To include one fancy product from a monster-scale U.S. mass brewery, to see if the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews. This was Michelob Hefeweizen , from the pride of St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch. 

          

         Click for pricing information and pre-quaffing evaluations. The beers tasted were: 

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

                         4. Data Analysis.              

                         a)                 Best and Worst. Compared to the lager test, we would expect the range of ""best"" choices to be more varied, since all the tested beers were supposed to be good. This expectation was most dramatically borne out in the ""Best and Worst"" rankings. 

         The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votes and 11.5 Best votes. (Tester No. 1 turned in a sheet with three Best selections, or two more than his theoretical quota. Tester No. 4 listed a Best and a Best-minus, which counted as half a vote.) 

          The results were clearest at the bottom: three Worsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen , even though most comments about the beer were more or less respectful. (""Bitter, drinkable."") But at the top and middle the situation was muddier: 

           

         There were three Bests for Full Sail ESB , which most of the tasters later said they weren't familiar with, and 2.5 for Redhook IPA , which all the tasters knew. But each of these also got a Worst vote, and most of the other beers had a mixed reading. So far, the tasters are meeting expectations, finding something to like in nearly all these fancy beers. 

                         b)                 Overall preference points. Here the complications increase. The loser was again apparent: Pyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points, as it had in the Best/Worst derby. But the amazing dark horse winner was Michelob Hefeweizen . The three elements of surprise here, in ascending order of unexpectedness, are: 

          

            This best-liked beer belonged to the same category, Hefeweizen, as the least-liked product, from Pyramid. 

            This was also the only outright Anheuser-Busch product in the contest (the Redhooks are 75 percent A-B free). It is safe to say that all tasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrew last, and Anheuser-Busch last of all. 

            Although it clearly won on overall preference points, Michelob Hefeweizen was the only beer not to have received a single ""Best"" vote. 

          

         The first two anomalies can be written off as testament to the power of a blind taste test. The third suggests an important difference in concepts of ""bestness."" Sometimes a product seems to be the best of a group simply because it's the most unusual or distinctive. This is why very high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly taste odd. But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive, day-in day-out acceptability. That seems to be Michelob Hefe 's achievement here: no one's first choice, but high on everyone's list. Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test.

Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer. One of the tasters, No. 7, decided to live dangerously and give specific brands and breweries for Samples A through J. This man was the only panel member whose job does not involve designing Microsoft Word--and the only one to identify two or more of the beers accurately and specifically. (He spotted Redhook IPA and Redhook ESB.) The fact that the beers correctly identified were the two most popular microbrews in the Seattle area suggests that familiarity is the main ingredient in knowing your beer. 

         Many others were simply lost. Barely half the tasters, five of nine, recognized that Michelob Hefeweizen                 was a Hefeweizen. Before the test, nine of nine would have said that picking out a Hefe was easy, because of its cloudy look and wheaty flavor. Three tasters thought Sam Adams was an IPA ; two thought Redhook's IPA was a Hefeweizen. In fairness, six of nine testers identified Pyramid Hefeweizen as a Hefe, and six recognized Full Sail ESB as a bitter. Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager : 

           

                         5. Implications                 and Directions for Future Research. Science does not always answer questions; often, it raises many new ones. This excursion into beer science mainly raises the question: What kind of people are we? 

         If we are Gradgrind-like empiricists, living our life for ""welfare maximization"" as described in introductory econ. courses, the conclusion is obvious. We learned from the first experiment to buy either Sam Adams (when we wanted maximum lager enjoyment per bottle) or Busch (for maximum taste and snob appeal per dollar). From this second round we see an even more efficient possibility: Buy Michelob Hefeweizen and nothing else, since on the basis of this test it's the best liked and the cheapest beer. By the way, if there is a single company whose achievements the testing panel honored, it would be Anheuser-Busch . From its brewing tanks came two of the double-crown winners of the taste tests: plain old Busch , the Taste-o-meter and Snob-o-meter victor of Round 1, and Michelob Hefeweizen , the preference-point and Val-u-meter winner this time. 

         But, of course, there is another possibility: that what is excluded in a blind taste test is in fact what we want, and are happy to pay for, when we sit down with a beer. The complicated label, the fancy bottle, the exotic concept that this beer has traveled from some far-off corner of Bohemia or even the Yakima Valley--all this may be cheap at the $1.25-per-pint cost difference between the cheapest and the most expensive beers. In elementary school, we all endured a standard science experiment: If you shut your eyes and pinch your nose closed, can you tell any difference in the taste of a slice of apple, of carrot, of pear? You can't--but that doesn't mean that from then on you should close your eyes, hold your nose, and chew a cheap carrot when you feel like having some fruit. There is a time and place for carrots, but also for juicy pears. There is a time for Busch, but also for Full Sail ""Equinox."" 

         For scientists who want to continue this work at home, here are a few suggestions for further research: 

          

            Tell the testers ahead of time what beers they will be drinking. Ask them to rank the beers, 1 through 10, based on how well they like them. Then compare the list with the ""revealed preferences"" that come from the blind test. 

            As a variation, show them the list ahead of time and ask them to pick out the beer they know they love and the one they know they hate. Then compare this with the ""after"" list. 

            If you're going to test imported lagers, try Foster's or Corona rather than Grolsch. 

            Remember to stay strictly in the scientist's role. Don't take the test yourself.

         When we last heard from them, the members of the 

               Slate                 beer-testing team were coping with lagers and trying to see if they could taste the 3-to-1 price difference between the most- and least-expensive brands. (Click for a wrap-up of the first round of beer tasting.) The answer was: They found one beer they really liked, Samuel Adams Boston Lager , and one they really hated, imported Grolsch from Holland. Both were expensive beers--Grolsch was the most expensive in the test--and otherwise the testers had a hard time telling beers apart. The members of the team, as noted in the original article, all hold day jobs at Microsoft, mainly as designers, managers, and coders for Microsoft Word. 

         The point of the second test was not to find the difference between cheap and expensive beers but instead to compare a variety of top-of-the-line beers. Was there one kind the tasters preferred consistently? Could they detect any of the subtleties of brewing style and provenance that microbrew customers pay such attention to when choosing some Doppelbock over a cream ale? 

         Since the tasting panel had left the first round grumbling that cheap lagers were not a fair test of their abilities, this second round of testing was advertised to the panel as a reward. Every beer in Round 2 would be a fancy beer. A microbrew. A ""craft beer."" A prestigious import. These were the kinds of beer the panel members said they liked--and the ones they said they were most familiar with. One aspect of the reward was that they would presumably enjoy the actual testing more--fewer rueful beer descriptions along the lines of ""urine"" or ""get it away!"" were expected than in the first round. The other aspect of anticipated reward was the panelists' unspoken but obvious assumption that this time they would ""do better"" on the test. Intellectual vanity being what it is, people who had fought for and won jobs at Microsoft and who still must fight every six months for primacy on the employee-ranking scale (which determines--gasp!--how many new stock options they receive) would assume that their skill as tasters was on trial, just as much as the beer was. Of course they were right, which is what made this round as amusing to administer as the first one had been. 

         Here is what happened and what it meant: 

                         1.                 Procedure. This was similar in most ways to the experimental approach of Round 1. The nine testers who showed up were a subset of the original 12. The missing three dropped out with excuses of ""my wife is sick"" (one person) and ""meeting is running long"" (two). 

         As before, each tester found before him on a table 10 red plastic cups, labeled A through J. Each cup held 3 ounces of one of the beers. The A-to-J labeling scheme was the same for all testers. Instead of saltines for palate-cleansing, this time we had popcorn and nuts. As they began, the tasters were given these and only these clues: 

          

            that the flight included one ""holdover"" beer from the previous round (Sam Adams); 

            that it included at least one import (Bass); 

            that it included at least one macrobrew , specifically, a member of the vast Anheuser-Busch family (Michelob Hefeweizen). 

          

         After sampling all beers, the tasters rated them as follows: 

          

                               Overall quality points, from zero to 100, reflecting their personal, subjective fondness for the beer. 

                               Descriptions of and comments about each beer's taste--""smooth and nutty,"" ""too strong,"" etc. If the first ranking was a measure of how good each beer was, this was an attempt to explain what made it good. 

                               Best                    and Worst , one of each from the group. 

                               Name                    that beer! The tasters were told that some of the drinks were Hefeweizens, some might be IPAs (India pale ales), some might be bitters, and so on. They were asked to put each beer in its proper category--and to name a specific brewery and brand if they could. The idea here was to test the veteran beer drinkers' claim to recognize the distinctive tastes of famous brands. (To see all the grids for all the beers, click .) 

          

                         2.                 Philosophy. The first round of testing was All Lager. This second round was All Fancy, and Mainly Not Lager. As several correspondents (for instance, the of Best American Beers ) have helpfully pointed out, the definition of lager provided last time was not exactly ""accurate."" If you want to stay within the realm of textbook definitions, a lager is a beer brewed a particular way--slowly, at cool temperatures, with yeast that settles on the bottom of the vat. This is in contrast with an ale, which is brewed faster, warmer, and with the yeast on top. By this same reasoning, lagers don't have to be light-colored, weak-flavored, and watery, as mainstream American lagers are. In principle, lagers can be dark, fierce, manly. Therefore, the correspondents suggest, it was wrong to impugn Sam Adams or Pete's Wicked for deceptive labeling, in presenting their tawnier, more flavorful beers as lagers too. 

         To this the beer scientist must say: Book-learning is fine in its place. But let's be realistic. Actual drinking experience teaches the American beer consumer that a) all cheap beers are lagers; and b) most lagers are light-colored and weak. The first test was designed to evaluate low-end beers and therefore had to be lager-centric. This one is designed to test fancy beers--but in the spirit of open-mindedness and technical accuracy, it includes a few ""strong"" lagers too. 

                         3. 

            Materials. The 10 test beers were chosen with several goals in mind: 

          

            To cover at least a modest range of fancy beer types--extra special bitter, India pale ale, Hefeweizen, and so on. 

            To include both imported and domestic beers. Among the domestic microbrews, there's an obvious skew toward beers from the Pacific Northwest. But as Microsoft would put it, that's a feature not a bug. These beers all came from the Safeway nearest the Redmond, Wash., ""main campus"" of Microsoft, and microbrews are supposed to be local. 

            To include one holdover from the previous test, as a scientific control on our tasters' preferences. This was Sam Adams , runaway winner of Round 1. 

            To include one fancy product from a monster-scale U.S. mass brewery, to see if the tasters liked it better or worse than the cute little microbrews. This was Michelob Hefeweizen , from the pride of St. Louis, Anheuser-Busch. 

          

         Click for pricing information and pre-quaffing evaluations. The beers tasted were: 

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

           

                         4. Data Analysis.              

                         a)                 Best and Worst. Compared to the lager test, we would expect the range of ""best"" choices to be more varied, since all the tested beers were supposed to be good. This expectation was most dramatically borne out in the ""Best and Worst"" rankings. 

         The nine tasters cast a total of nine Worst votes and 11.5 Best votes. (Tester No. 1 turned in a sheet with three Best selections, or two more than his theoretical quota. Tester No. 4 listed a Best and a Best-minus, which counted as half a vote.) 

          The results were clearest at the bottom: three Worsts for Pyramid Hefeweizen , even though most comments about the beer were more or less respectful. (""Bitter, drinkable."") But at the top and middle the situation was muddier: 

           

         There were three Bests for Full Sail ESB , which most of the tasters later said they weren't familiar with, and 2.5 for Redhook IPA , which all the tasters knew. But each of these also got a Worst vote, and most of the other beers had a mixed reading. So far, the tasters are meeting expectations, finding something to like in nearly all these fancy beers. 

                         b)                 Overall preference points. Here the complications increase. The loser was again apparent: Pyramid Hefeweizen came in last on rating points, as it had in the Best/Worst derby. But the amazing dark horse winner was Michelob Hefeweizen . The three elements of surprise here, in ascending order of unexpectedness, are: 

          

            This best-liked beer belonged to the same category, Hefeweizen, as the least-liked product, from Pyramid. 

            This was also the only outright Anheuser-Busch product in the contest (the Redhooks are 75 percent A-B free). It is safe to say that all tasters would have said beforehand that they would rank an American macrobrew last, and Anheuser-Busch last of all. 

            Although it clearly won on overall preference points, Michelob Hefeweizen was the only beer not to have received a single ""Best"" vote. 

          

         The first two anomalies can be written off as testament to the power of a blind taste test. The third suggests an important difference in concepts of ""bestness."" Sometimes a product seems to be the best of a group simply because it's the most unusual or distinctive. This is why very high Wine Spectator ratings often go to wines that mainly taste odd. But another kind of bestness involves an unobtrusive, day-in day-out acceptability. That seems to be Michelob Hefe 's achievement here: no one's first choice, but high on everyone's list. Let's go to the charts: 

         This table shows how the beers performed on ""raw score""--that is, without the advanced statistical adjustment of throwing out the highest and lowest score each beer received. 

           

         Next, we have ""corrected average preference points,"" throwing out the high and low marks for each beer. The result is basically the same: 

           

         It is worth noting the fate of Sam Adams on these charts. Here it ends up with a score of less than 61. These were the numbers awarded by the very same tasters who gave it a corrected preference rating of 83.33 the last time around--and 10 ""Best"" votes, vs. one Best (and one Worst) this time. The shift in Bests is understandable and demonstrates the importance of picking your competition. The severe drop in preference points illustrates more acutely the ancient principle of being a big fish in a small pond. These same tasters thought that Sam Adams was objectively much better when it was surrounded by Busch and Schmidt's. 

                         c)                 Value rankings. Last time this calculation led to what the colorful French would call a bouleversement. One of the cheapest beers, Busch, which had been in the lower ranks on overall preference points, came out at the top on value-for-money ratings, because it was so cheap. The big surprise now is that the highest-rated beer was also the cheapest one, Michelob Hefe , so the value calculation turned into a rout: 

           

                         Pyramid 

            Hefeweizen was expensive on top of being unpopular, so its position at the bottom was hammered home--but not as painfully as that of Bass Ale . Bass had been in the respectable lower middle class of the preference rankings, so its disappointing Val-u-meter showing mainly reflects the fact that it was the only beer not on ""sale"" and therefore by far the costliest entry in the experiment. 

                         d)                 Taster skill. As members of the tasting panel began to suspect, they themselves were being judged while they judged the beer.

Much in the fashion of blind men describing an elephant, here is a how the testers handled Sam Adams Boston Lager :

32,"Fight Clubbed 

                         Fight Club , a movie about a fictional organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than its share of media hand-wringing, particularly diatribes about Hollywood's infatuation with violence and Faludi-esque ruminations about the emasculated American male. Fight Club , however, has not sparked an iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed politics, and cultural myopia. 

         UFC began in 1993 as a locker-room fantasy. What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler? A karate champion fought a sumo champion? Promoters built an octagonal chain-link cage, invited eight top martial artists, and set them loose in no-holds-barred, bare-knuckles fights. ""There are no rules!"" bragged an early press release. Contestants would fight till ""knockout, submission, doctor's intervention, or death."" UFC allowed, even promoted, all notions of bad sportsmanship: kicking a man when he's down, hitting him in the groin, choking. Four-hundred-pound men were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size. Only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden. 

         The gimmick entranced thousands of people (well, men). What happens when a 620-pound sumo champion fights a 200-pound kickboxer? Answer: The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds. They tuned in for bloodshed--""the damage,"" as fans like to call it. UFC fights could be horrifying. Tank Abbott, an ill-tempered, 270-pound street fighter, knocks out hapless opponent John Matua in 15 seconds. Then, before the ref can intervene, Abbott belts the unconscious Matua in the head, sending him into a fit, limbs quivering uncontrollably, blood spurting from his mouth. Abbott, naturally, became a cult hero and won a guest spot on Friends . (Matua walked out of the ring.) Soon, UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing 300,000 pay-per-view subscribers for its quarterly competitions. 

         But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage. My passion for ultimate fighting (which is also called ""extreme"" or ""no-holds-barred"" fighting) began when I saw the finals of UFC IV. Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over. In 30 seconds, Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to the canvas, and mounted him. For the next 15 minutes, Severn pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man. Gracie's face grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment. Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an opening, wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant into submission. 

         UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting. Nursed on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography, a dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts. The UFC punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves the world's greatest fighters, found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or leg-locked them. ""UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting, of boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in an actual fight,"" says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer . 

         Instead of being carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely like ... sex. Almost all fights ended on the ground, one man mounting the other in missionary position, the pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30 minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes, there was always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others, fighters ""tapped out,"" surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing chokes and joint locks. It was not barbarism. It was science. 

         The UFC spawned a new breed of ""mixed martial artists."" World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers learned to grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They became, without doubt, the best fighters in the world. (Click for more about the fighters.) Mike Tyson wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match. When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC, a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him with a submission hold in 16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial arts with techniques that actually work. 

         UFC's promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart. The collapse began in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and head butts. It was ""barbaric,"" he said. It was ""not a sport."" He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against ""human cockfighting"" became a crusade, and like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding. 

         UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is. In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred fighting has a long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight consists of an exchange of upper-body blows that halts when one fighter falls. 

         Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate fighting is safer and less cruel than America's blood sport. For example, critics pilloried ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation accustomed to boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves, a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull. That's why ultimate fighters won't throw multiple skull punches. As a result, they avoid the concussive head wounds that kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage that cripples them. 

         Similarly, the chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque. Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead. But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing: Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes, because nothing stops their heads from snapping back. The chain-link fence prevents hyperextension. 

         When I tell people I'm an ultimate fighting fan, they invariably respond: ""Don't people get killed all the time doing that?"" But no one has ever been killed at the UFC--though boxers are killed every year. No one has even been seriously injured at the UFC. On the rare occasions when a bout has ended with a bloody knockout, the loser has always walked out of the ring. 

         But this does not impress boxing fans, who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting. McCain sat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed. When I asked him to explain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting, he exploded at me, ""If you can't see the moral distinction, then we have nothing to talk about!"" Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office. 

         But logic has not served the UFC well. Where McCain led, a prudish nation followed. George Will opined against UFC. The American Medical Association recommended a ban. New York state outlawed ultimate fighting, as did other states. The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts, barring the UFC from the lucrative casino market. (One public TV station refused a UFC sponsorship ad. The only other organization the station ever rejected was the Ku Klux Klan.) Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over the country, forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees. The UFC was exiled from mega-arenas to ever-smaller venues in ever more out-of-the-way states: Louisiana, Iowa, and Alabama. The match I attended in October 1997 was held in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino. 

         The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow. In early 1997, McCain became chairman of the commerce committee, which oversees the cable industry. In April 1997, the president of the National Cable Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cable industry's influence in Washington. Time Warner, TCI, Request, Cablevision Systems, Viewer's Choice, and other major operators stopped airing UFC events, saying they were too violent for children. Never mind that 1) UFC only aired on pay-per-view, so children could not see it unless their parents paid for it; and 2) the same cable outfits carried boxing matches, R and NC-17 movies, and professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC. The UFC's ""addressable audience""--the potential number of PPV subscribers--shrank from 35 million at its peak to 7.5 million today. 

         ""It was a very cheap way for the cable companies to portray themselves as anti-violence. It did not cost them much and it made them look good in Washington,"" says Carol Klenfner, spokeswoman for UFC's parent company, SEG. 

         The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own cause. The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of carnage. Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting's potential for death. UFC folks accused McCain, without any evidence, of opposing the sport as a favor to campaign contributors. Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the other ultimate fighting operation, the now-defunct Battlecade, were arrested for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indian reservation outside Montreal. 

         In the past two years, an increasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics. The competition, which had been gradually adding safety rules since the first fight, imposed even more. It institued rounds and a ""10-point must"" scoring system. It banned head butts and groin strikes. You can no longer kick a downed man or elbow someone in the back of the head. Fighters are required to wear thin martial arts gloves (a purely cosmetic change). The UFC imposed weight classes, ending the David-and-Goliath mismatches that made early fights so compelling. 

         None of this soothed the cable operators, who have kept UFC off the air. The pay-per-view audience has plunged from 300,000 per show to 15,000. UFC can no longer afford its best fighters: Some are fighting overseas. Others, notably Ken Shamrock (Frank's brother), have become pro wrestlers. Fights have deteriorated. UFC is limping along, but it has been reduced to scheduling events in Japan and Brazil. 

         ""Sports fans want to grow with the sport,"" says former UFC fighter David Beneteau. ""They want to recognize the athletes. They want to see the same fighters come back. When you compare UFC now to what it was, the fighters are not the same, the rules are not the same. The fans have no story to follow."" 

         Even as it disappears from public view, ultimate fighting is returning to its roots. Away from the scrutiny of the major media, state legislators, and McCain, kids are still learning mixed martial-arts techniques, and small-time promoters are quietly staging events. You can see Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro, Calif. You can watch the Warrior's Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento. Texans compete in Houston's Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship. Tribal casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments. The Extreme Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa.

                         Fight Club , a movie about a fictional organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than its share of media hand-wringing, particularly diatribes about Hollywood's infatuation with violence and Faludi-esque ruminations about the emasculated American male. Fight Club , however, has not sparked an iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed politics, and cultural myopia. 

         UFC began in 1993 as a locker-room fantasy. What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler? A karate champion fought a sumo champion? Promoters built an octagonal chain-link cage, invited eight top martial artists, and set them loose in no-holds-barred, bare-knuckles fights. ""There are no rules!"" bragged an early press release. Contestants would fight till ""knockout, submission, doctor's intervention, or death."" UFC allowed, even promoted, all notions of bad sportsmanship: kicking a man when he's down, hitting him in the groin, choking. Four-hundred-pound men were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size. Only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden. 

         The gimmick entranced thousands of people (well, men). What happens when a 620-pound sumo champion fights a 200-pound kickboxer? Answer: The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds. They tuned in for bloodshed--""the damage,"" as fans like to call it. UFC fights could be horrifying. Tank Abbott, an ill-tempered, 270-pound street fighter, knocks out hapless opponent John Matua in 15 seconds. Then, before the ref can intervene, Abbott belts the unconscious Matua in the head, sending him into a fit, limbs quivering uncontrollably, blood spurting from his mouth. Abbott, naturally, became a cult hero and won a guest spot on Friends . (Matua walked out of the ring.) Soon, UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing 300,000 pay-per-view subscribers for its quarterly competitions. 

         But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage. My passion for ultimate fighting (which is also called ""extreme"" or ""no-holds-barred"" fighting) began when I saw the finals of UFC IV. Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over. In 30 seconds, Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to the canvas, and mounted him. For the next 15 minutes, Severn pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man. Gracie's face grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment. Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an opening, wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant into submission. 

         UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting. Nursed on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography, a dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts. The UFC punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves the world's greatest fighters, found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or leg-locked them. ""UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting, of boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in an actual fight,"" says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer . 

         Instead of being carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely like ... sex. Almost all fights ended on the ground, one man mounting the other in missionary position, the pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30 minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes, there was always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others, fighters ""tapped out,"" surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing chokes and joint locks. It was not barbarism. It was science. 

         The UFC spawned a new breed of ""mixed martial artists."" World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers learned to grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They became, without doubt, the best fighters in the world. (Click for more about the fighters.) Mike Tyson wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match. When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC, a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him with a submission hold in 16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial arts with techniques that actually work. 

         UFC's promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart. The collapse began in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and head butts. It was ""barbaric,"" he said. It was ""not a sport."" He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against ""human cockfighting"" became a crusade, and like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding. 

         UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is. In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred fighting has a long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight consists of an exchange of upper-body blows that halts when one fighter falls. 

         Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate fighting is safer and less cruel than America's blood sport. For example, critics pilloried ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation accustomed to boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves, a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull. That's why ultimate fighters won't throw multiple skull punches. As a result, they avoid the concussive head wounds that kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage that cripples them. 

         Similarly, the chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque. Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead. But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing: Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes, because nothing stops their heads from snapping back.

         But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage. My passion for ultimate fighting (which is also called ""extreme"" or ""no-holds-barred"" fighting) began when I saw the finals of UFC IV. Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over. In 30 seconds, Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to the canvas, and mounted him. For the next 15 minutes, Severn pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man. Gracie's face grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment. Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an opening, wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant into submission. 

         UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting. Nursed on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography, a dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts. The UFC punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves the world's greatest fighters, found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or leg-locked them. ""UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting, of boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in an actual fight,"" says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer . 

         Instead of being carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely like ... sex. Almost all fights ended on the ground, one man mounting the other in missionary position, the pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30 minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes, there was always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others, fighters ""tapped out,"" surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing chokes and joint locks. It was not barbarism. It was science. 

         The UFC spawned a new breed of ""mixed martial artists."" World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers learned to grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They became, without doubt, the best fighters in the world. (Click for more about the fighters.) Mike Tyson wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match. When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC, a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him with a submission hold in 16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial arts with techniques that actually work. 

         UFC's promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart. The collapse began in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and head butts. It was ""barbaric,"" he said. It was ""not a sport."" He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against ""human cockfighting"" became a crusade, and like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding. 

         UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is. In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred fighting has a long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight consists of an exchange of upper-body blows that halts when one fighter falls. 

         Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate fighting is safer and less cruel than America's blood sport. For example, critics pilloried ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation accustomed to boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves, a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull. That's why ultimate fighters won't throw multiple skull punches. As a result, they avoid the concussive head wounds that kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage that cripples them. 

         Similarly, the chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque. Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead. But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing: Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes, because nothing stops their heads from snapping back. The chain-link fence prevents hyperextension. 

         When I tell people I'm an ultimate fighting fan, they invariably respond: ""Don't people get killed all the time doing that?"" But no one has ever been killed at the UFC--though boxers are killed every year. No one has even been seriously injured at the UFC. On the rare occasions when a bout has ended with a bloody knockout, the loser has always walked out of the ring. 

         But this does not impress boxing fans, who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting. McCain sat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed. When I asked him to explain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting, he exploded at me, ""If you can't see the moral distinction, then we have nothing to talk about!"" Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office. 

         But logic has not served the UFC well. Where McCain led, a prudish nation followed. George Will opined against UFC. The American Medical Association recommended a ban. New York state outlawed ultimate fighting, as did other states. The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts, barring the UFC from the lucrative casino market. (One public TV station refused a UFC sponsorship ad. The only other organization the station ever rejected was the Ku Klux Klan.) Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over the country, forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees. The UFC was exiled from mega-arenas to ever-smaller venues in ever more out-of-the-way states: Louisiana, Iowa, and Alabama. The match I attended in October 1997 was held in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino. 

         The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow. In early 1997, McCain became chairman of the commerce committee, which oversees the cable industry. In April 1997, the president of the National Cable Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cable industry's influence in Washington. Time Warner, TCI, Request, Cablevision Systems, Viewer's Choice, and other major operators stopped airing UFC events, saying they were too violent for children. Never mind that 1) UFC only aired on pay-per-view, so children could not see it unless their parents paid for it; and 2) the same cable outfits carried boxing matches, R and NC-17 movies, and professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC. The UFC's ""addressable audience""--the potential number of PPV subscribers--shrank from 35 million at its peak to 7.5 million today. 

         ""It was a very cheap way for the cable companies to portray themselves as anti-violence. It did not cost them much and it made them look good in Washington,"" says Carol Klenfner, spokeswoman for UFC's parent company, SEG. 

         The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own cause. The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of carnage. Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting's potential for death. UFC folks accused McCain, without any evidence, of opposing the sport as a favor to campaign contributors. Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the other ultimate fighting operation, the now-defunct Battlecade, were arrested for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indian reservation outside Montreal. 

         In the past two years, an increasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics. The competition, which had been gradually adding safety rules since the first fight, imposed even more. It institued rounds and a ""10-point must"" scoring system. It banned head butts and groin strikes. You can no longer kick a downed man or elbow someone in the back of the head. Fighters are required to wear thin martial arts gloves (a purely cosmetic change). The UFC imposed weight classes, ending the David-and-Goliath mismatches that made early fights so compelling. 

         None of this soothed the cable operators, who have kept UFC off the air. The pay-per-view audience has plunged from 300,000 per show to 15,000. UFC can no longer afford its best fighters: Some are fighting overseas. Others, notably Ken Shamrock (Frank's brother), have become pro wrestlers. Fights have deteriorated. UFC is limping along, but it has been reduced to scheduling events in Japan and Brazil. 

         ""Sports fans want to grow with the sport,"" says former UFC fighter David Beneteau. ""They want to recognize the athletes. They want to see the same fighters come back. When you compare UFC now to what it was, the fighters are not the same, the rules are not the same. The fans have no story to follow."" 

         Even as it disappears from public view, ultimate fighting is returning to its roots. Away from the scrutiny of the major media, state legislators, and McCain, kids are still learning mixed martial-arts techniques, and small-time promoters are quietly staging events. You can see Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro, Calif. You can watch the Warrior's Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento. Texans compete in Houston's Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship. Tribal casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments. The Extreme Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa. The money is low; the crowds are small; and there's not a TV camera in sight. Ultimate fighting should have become boxing. Instead it has gone underground. It has become Fight Club.

         A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs. And the people were grateful. 

         That's probably because they're not getting all that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't score at all last year. 

         If that's true, many of us could use a little sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26 years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb (who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it? 

         And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance, located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares. 

         Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for $11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works. 

         It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line ""... and right ball go POW."" My wife hadn't noticed any difference at all.

You're much more likely to land on ""Try phone sex, dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,"" or articles such as ""Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged."" 

         An article in the April Cosmopolitan , ""The Six Best Sex Positions,"" seemed more promising than the Redbook playbook. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was ""The Butterfly,"" which we had to read three times to comprehend. The man stands, the woman remains supine on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could, for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen.

         Next we tried those ""Better Sex"" instructional videos advertised in the New York Times                 Book Review. I ordered Better Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex Fun , and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques (priced about $11.95 each, not including shipping and handling). My wife couldn't bear to watch them; I persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with ""well-known sex therapist"" Diana Wiley, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force could increase its third-quarter productivity. Instead she runs through all the euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous commentary. 

         Wiley's overexplanation of everything two people can do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a five-minute video segment on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition of hotel and travel ads, the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the women. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video! The inanity of the experts and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic as ... well, as the New York Times . You could learn more from any randomly selected porn video.

         Another approach is food. The notion that certain foods, such as oysters or rhino horn, are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much discounted. But it's plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then dining on it, just the two of you, could be erotic. Especially if (like me) your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself standing in front of the microwave, screaming, ""Come on, goddammit!"" Intercourses , by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge ($24.95, Terrace Publishing, 1997), preaches that for every time of day and every phase of a relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual response. (There's also a chart showing which foods are good for eating off which body parts.) Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening for the Intercourses experiment, settling on rosemary-scented lamb over pasta (Page 87) followed by frozen coffee almond dessert (Page 31). According to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in many perfumes) and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings. The dessert was mostly coffee, rum, and Kahlua, which has worked before. 

         We shopped for the food together and cooked together, drinking wine and beer along the way. At one point while I was working on the dessert, I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream mixture. ""Till it's stiff--it's an aphrodisiac,"" she said. Preparation took less than an hour, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room table for the first time ever without guests, we were having fun by candlelight. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.

         That's when we went for the Viagra ($212.50 for 10 doses, which includes a ""consultation"" fee). The drug was prescribed by a doctor, whom I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Fla., where I've never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a cover-their-ass questionnaire in three minutes. 

         We each decided to take one pill, clinked our glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom, knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to ""work."" I suggested that we play strip poker, something I'd never done. Deb had never even played poker, so I had to explain the rules. I won in about six hands, auspiciously I thought, with three aces. But we still weren't really in the mood yet. 

         So then I got out the other purchase I'd made at A Touch of Romance--""Dirty Dice"" ($4.95). One of the two pink cubes is marked with these words instead of dots: ""lips,"" ""above waist,"" ""ear,"" ""breast,"" ""below waist,"" and ""?"". The other cube is labeled ""kiss,"" ""squeeze,"" ""lick,"" ""blow,"" ""suck,"" and ""eat."" We took turns throwing the dice, but the activities generated seemed forced and arbitrary. Finally, as they say at NASA, there was word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating. It was pretty much like all other sex, except for a slight lightheadedness. Deb said she noticed a remote tingling sensation. On the plus side, there was no priapism and neither of us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal heart attack, which was nice.

         St. Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for man's disobedience to God: the body's disobeying of the mind, the will, the spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden hard-on.) Jean-Paul Sartre discovered something similar, although celebrating it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the body's defiance of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.) Sartre's view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one hand and sexual planning on the other. The more of the one, the less of the other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help. Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my wife said about Viagra, ""You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and then you don't have it so much. ... Anything that makes you think about it like that is just creepy."" 

         This is not to say there isn't a way out of this conflict between desire and design. With homage to our potent POTUS, there is, I think, a Third Way that's neither sexual complacency nor standard self-help. If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to block it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with alcohol and drugs. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks, including diminished physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance. 

         So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick) if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your partner you took Viagra. Or give each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner drink, saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an unselfconsciously turned-on partner is a real compensation for that, and next time, your partner can surprise you. And yes, this requires trust. But why would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is less communication.

If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to block it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with alcohol and drugs. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks, including diminished physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance. 

         So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick) if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your partner you took Viagra. Or give each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner drink, saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an unselfconsciously turned-on partner is a real compensation for that, and next time, your partner can surprise you. And yes, this requires trust. But why would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is less communication.

         A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs. And the people were grateful. 

         That's probably because they're not getting all that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't score at all last year. 

         If that's true, many of us could use a little sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26 years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb (who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it? 

         And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance, located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares. 

         Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for $11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works. 

         It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line ""... and right ball go POW."" My wife hadn't noticed any difference at all.

The man stands, the woman remains supine on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could, for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen.

         Next we tried those ""Better Sex"" instructional videos advertised in the New York Times                 Book Review. I ordered Better Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex Fun , and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques (priced about $11.95 each, not including shipping and handling). My wife couldn't bear to watch them; I persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with ""well-known sex therapist"" Diana Wiley, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force could increase its third-quarter productivity. Instead she runs through all the euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous commentary. 

         Wiley's overexplanation of everything two people can do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a five-minute video segment on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition of hotel and travel ads, the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the women. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video! The inanity of the experts and the dubious casting make these films about as erotic as ... well, as the New York Times . You could learn more from any randomly selected porn video.

         Another approach is food. The notion that certain foods, such as oysters or rhino horn, are aphrodisiacs has been pretty much discounted. But it's plausible to think that cooking a meal together and then dining on it, just the two of you, could be erotic. Especially if (like me) your schedule frequently forces you to eat alone and you often find yourself standing in front of the microwave, screaming, ""Come on, goddammit!"" Intercourses , by Martha Hopkins and Randall Lockridge ($24.95, Terrace Publishing, 1997), preaches that for every time of day and every phase of a relationship there is a type of eating experience that will heighten sexual response. (There's also a chart showing which foods are good for eating off which body parts.) Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening for the Intercourses experiment, settling on rosemary-scented lamb over pasta (Page 87) followed by frozen coffee almond dessert (Page 31). According to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in many perfumes) and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings. The dessert was mostly coffee, rum, and Kahlua, which has worked before. 

         We shopped for the food together and cooked together, drinking wine and beer along the way. At one point while I was working on the dessert, I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream mixture. ""Till it's stiff--it's an aphrodisiac,"" she said. Preparation took less than an hour, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room table for the first time ever without guests, we were having fun by candlelight. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.

         That's when we went for the Viagra ($212.50 for 10 doses, which includes a ""consultation"" fee). The drug was prescribed by a doctor, whom I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Fla., where I've never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a cover-their-ass questionnaire in three minutes. 

         We each decided to take one pill, clinked our glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom, knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to ""work."" I suggested that we play strip poker, something I'd never done. Deb had never even played poker, so I had to explain the rules. I won in about six hands, auspiciously I thought, with three aces. But we still weren't really in the mood yet. 

         So then I got out the other purchase I'd made at A Touch of Romance--""Dirty Dice"" ($4.95). One of the two pink cubes is marked with these words instead of dots: ""lips,"" ""above waist,"" ""ear,"" ""breast,"" ""below waist,"" and ""?"". The other cube is labeled ""kiss,"" ""squeeze,"" ""lick,"" ""blow,"" ""suck,"" and ""eat."" We took turns throwing the dice, but the activities generated seemed forced and arbitrary. Finally, as they say at NASA, there was word from the pad that the launch sequence was initiating. It was pretty much like all other sex, except for a slight lightheadedness. Deb said she noticed a remote tingling sensation. On the plus side, there was no priapism and neither of us experienced disruption of our color vision nor a fatal heart attack, which was nice.

         St. Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for man's disobedience to God: the body's disobeying of the mind, the will, the spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden hard-on.) Jean-Paul Sartre discovered something similar, although celebrating it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the body's defiance of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.) Sartre's view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one hand and sexual planning on the other. The more of the one, the less of the other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help. Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my wife said about Viagra, ""You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and then you don't have it so much. ...

34,"It's Time To Keelhaul U-Haul! 

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life. 

         But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U-Haul. If he had tried to rent from U-Haul, he never would have escaped from Tibet. (For the complete back story, see ""Shopping Avenger"" column and one.) 

         The complaints about U-Haul's nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail. One correspondent, B.R., wrote in with this cautionary tale: ""Last weekend, I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house. My brother had reserved a moving truck with U-Haul for the big day. I warned my brother about U-Haul's 'not really a reservation per se' policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger. He didn't believe such a thing would happen to him, so he didn't act on my warning."" 

         B.R. continues--as if you don't know what happened already--""I went to U-Haul with my brother to get our 'reserved' truck. The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated. When we got to the front of the line, the clerk informed us that our 'reserved' truck had not yet been returned. We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot. The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost."" 

         B.R. and his chastened brother--the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat--went to Ryder. ""Ryder had a truck available for us. The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U-Haul is not."" 

         The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U-Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U-Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks, but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that, based on what they have read in this column, they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere. 

         The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U-Haul in the next episode, but now on to this month's airline debacle. 

         Before we begin, though, the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month's contest, in which readers were asked to answer the question, ""What's the difference between pests and airlines?"" 

         The winner is one Tom Morgan, who wrote, ""You can hire someone to kill pests."" Tom is the winner of a year's supply of Turtle Wax, and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year's supply. The new contest question: How much Turtle Wax comprises a year's supply of Turtle Wax? 

         This month's airline in the spotlight is Southwest. Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its ""sterling"" customer service. This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions. The most articulate, and the most troubling, came from M., who wrote, ""Last year, flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family (two really little kids included), we set down at Midway in a rainstorm. And waited for our bags. And waited for bags. And waited for bags."" 

         An hour later, M. says, the bags showed up, ""soaked through. We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated, unclear, and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen."" 

         When they arrived at their destination, M. and her family made a terrible discovery, ""We discovered that our clothes were soaked through--the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels, destroying lots of other clothes. Obviously, our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain. To this day, I've never heard a thing from SW, despite calls and letters."" 

         This, of course, is where Shopping Avenger steps in. Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline, in that it doesn't go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers (see: ), so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M.'s problem. 

         What I got at first, though, was a load of corporate hoo-ha. 

         ""The airline's policy, which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines, requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination,"" a Southwest spokeswoman, Linda Rutherford, e-mailed me. ""[M.] indicates she called for a few days, but did not file a report in person until April 12--three days later. Southwest, as a courtesy, took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage."" Rutherford said that M. should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim. 

         Harrumph, the Shopping Avenger says. It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines. I forwarded this message to M., who replied: 

         ""Wow. Well, of course I didn't file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn't know the clothes were ruined at the airport. I didn't know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff. (And it's worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in-laws nipping at our heels.)"" 

         She goes on, ""I did call that evening ... and was told that that sufficed. This is the first time I've been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours. ... When I filed on the 12 th , I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation. The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this. ... They know that the type of 'evidence' they want is impossible to obtain. They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time."" 

         Southwest's response actually served to anger M. more than the original problem. ""Before, they had a mildly annoyed but loyal customer (who would have been placated by an apology and thrilled with some modest token of their regret). Now they have a pissed-off customer."" 

         Things do look bad for Southwest, don't they? The Shopping Avenger sent M.'s response to Rutherford, who e-mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for ""policy information."" The Shopping Avenger e-mailed back again, stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would, if this case were brought to trial, undoubtedly find for the plaintiff (the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor, judge, and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice--defendants are represented by the president of U-Haul), and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck. 

         But then she came through, provisionally, ""Yep, you can be sure if [M.] will call me we will get everything squared away. I'm sorry it's taken this long for her to get someone who can help, but we will take care of it from here."" 

         Stay tuned, shoppers, to hear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M. and apologize to her for her troubles. 

         The story of M. reminds the Shopping Avenger of a central truth of consumer service: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. 

         Take the case of K., who found himself waiting in vain for Circuit City to repair his television. Televisions break, even 1-year-old televisions, as is the case with K's. But Circuit City, where he bought the television, gave him a terrible runaround. The Shopping Avenger dispatched his sidekick, Tad the Deputy Avenger, to get to the bottom of K.'s story. This is what he found: K. grew concerned, Tad the Deputy Avenger reports, after his television had been in the Circuit City shop for a week. When he called, he was told to ""check back next week."" When he asked if someone from the store could call him with more information, he was refused. Weeks went by. When K. told one Circuit City employee that he really would like to get his television back, the employee, K. says, asked him, ""Don't you have another television in your house?"" 

         More than a month later--after hours and hours and hours of telephone calls and days missed at work--K. received his television back. 

         Mistakes happen, but not, Tad the Deputy Avenger found out, at Circuit City. The case, K. was told by a Circuit City official, was ""handled perfectly."" Another official, Morgan Stewart in public relations, assured Deputy Avenger Tad that ""We got to be a big and successful company by treating customers better than the other guy."" The Shopping Avenger and his loyal sidekick would like to hear from other Circuit City customers: Does Circuit City, in fact, treat its customers better than the other guy?

34,"It's Time To Keelhaul U-Haul! 

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life. 

         But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U-Haul. If he had tried to rent from U-Haul, he never would have escaped from Tibet. (For the complete back story, see ""Shopping Avenger"" column and one.) 

         The complaints about U-Haul's nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail. One correspondent, B.R., wrote in with this cautionary tale: ""Last weekend, I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house. My brother had reserved a moving truck with U-Haul for the big day. I warned my brother about U-Haul's 'not really a reservation per se' policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger. He didn't believe such a thing would happen to him, so he didn't act on my warning."" 

         B.R. continues--as if you don't know what happened already--""I went to U-Haul with my brother to get our 'reserved' truck. The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated. When we got to the front of the line, the clerk informed us that our 'reserved' truck had not yet been returned. We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot. The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost."" 

         B.R. and his chastened brother--the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat--went to Ryder. ""Ryder had a truck available for us. The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U-Haul is not."" 

         The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U-Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U-Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks, but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that, based on what they have read in this column, they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere. 

         The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U-Haul in the next episode, but now on to this month's airline debacle. 

         Before we begin, though, the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month's contest, in which readers were asked to answer the question, ""What's the difference between pests and airlines?"" 

         The winner is one Tom Morgan, who wrote, ""You can hire someone to kill pests."" Tom is the winner of a year's supply of Turtle Wax, and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year's supply. The new contest question: How much Turtle Wax comprises a year's supply of Turtle Wax? 

         This month's airline in the spotlight is Southwest. Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its ""sterling"" customer service. This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions. The most articulate, and the most troubling, came from M., who wrote, ""Last year, flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family (two really little kids included), we set down at Midway in a rainstorm. And waited for our bags. And waited for bags. And waited for bags."" 

         An hour later, M. says, the bags showed up, ""soaked through. We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated, unclear, and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen."" 

         When they arrived at their destination, M. and her family made a terrible discovery, ""We discovered that our clothes were soaked through--the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels, destroying lots of other clothes. Obviously, our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain. To this day, I've never heard a thing from SW, despite calls and letters."" 

         This, of course, is where Shopping Avenger steps in. Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline, in that it doesn't go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers (see: ), so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M.'s problem. 

         What I got at first, though, was a load of corporate hoo-ha. 

         ""The airline's policy, which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines, requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination,"" a Southwest spokeswoman, Linda Rutherford, e-mailed me. ""[M.] indicates she called for a few days, but did not file a report in person until April 12--three days later. Southwest, as a courtesy, took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage."" Rutherford said that M. should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim. 

         Harrumph, the Shopping Avenger says. It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines. I forwarded this message to M., who replied: 

         ""Wow. Well, of course I didn't file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn't know the clothes were ruined at the airport. I didn't know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff. (And it's worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in-laws nipping at our heels.)"" 

         She goes on, ""I did call that evening ... and was told that that sufficed. This is the first time I've been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours. ... When I filed on the 12 th , I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation. The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this. ... They know that the type of 'evidence' they want is impossible to obtain. They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time.""

         Things do look bad for Southwest, don't they? The Shopping Avenger sent M.'s response to Rutherford, who e-mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for ""policy information."" The Shopping Avenger e-mailed back again, stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would, if this case were brought to trial, undoubtedly find for the plaintiff (the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor, judge, and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice--defendants are represented by the president of U-Haul), and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck.

35,"Fight Clubbed 

                         Fight Club , a movie about a fictional organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp, has provoked more than its share of media hand-wringing, particularly diatribes about Hollywood's infatuation with violence and Faludi-esque ruminations about the emasculated American male. Fight Club , however, has not sparked an iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp: the Ultimate Fighting Championship. UFC's flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports, a cautionary tale of prudishness, heavy-handed politics, and cultural myopia. 

         UFC began in 1993 as a locker-room fantasy. What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler? A karate champion fought a sumo champion? Promoters built an octagonal chain-link cage, invited eight top martial artists, and set them loose in no-holds-barred, bare-knuckles fights. ""There are no rules!"" bragged an early press release. Contestants would fight till ""knockout, submission, doctor's intervention, or death."" UFC allowed, even promoted, all notions of bad sportsmanship: kicking a man when he's down, hitting him in the groin, choking. Four-hundred-pound men were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size. Only biting and eye-gouging were forbidden. 

         The gimmick entranced thousands of people (well, men). What happens when a 620-pound sumo champion fights a 200-pound kickboxer? Answer: The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds. They tuned in for bloodshed--""the damage,"" as fans like to call it. UFC fights could be horrifying. Tank Abbott, an ill-tempered, 270-pound street fighter, knocks out hapless opponent John Matua in 15 seconds. Then, before the ref can intervene, Abbott belts the unconscious Matua in the head, sending him into a fit, limbs quivering uncontrollably, blood spurting from his mouth. Abbott, naturally, became a cult hero and won a guest spot on Friends . (Matua walked out of the ring.) Soon, UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing 300,000 pay-per-view subscribers for its quarterly competitions. 

         But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage. My passion for ultimate fighting (which is also called ""extreme"" or ""no-holds-barred"" fighting) began when I saw the finals of UFC IV. Royce Gracie, a 180-pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist, was matched against a 275-pound beast named Dan Severn, one of the top heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over. In 30 seconds, Severn had grabbed Gracie, flung him to the canvas, and mounted him. For the next 15 minutes, Severn pummeled and elbowed and head-butted the smaller man. Gracie's face grew drawn, and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn's bombardment. Then, all of sudden, Gracie, still lying on his back, saw an opening, wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant into submission. 

         UFC's caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting. Nursed on boxing and Hollywood, Americans imagine fights as choreography, a dance of elegant combinations, roundhouse kicks, clean knockouts. The UFC punctured this. Boxers floundered. Experts in striking martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do, who fancied themselves the world's greatest fighters, found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters, who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or leg-locked them. ""UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting, of boxing, karate, kung fu. It showed the reality of what works in an actual fight,"" says Dave Meltzer, editor of Wrestling Observer . 

         Instead of being carnivals of gore, UFC fights looked strangely like ... sex. Almost all fights ended on the ground, one man mounting the other in missionary position, the pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five, 10, even 30 minutes. There were few spectacular knockouts. The referee--yes, there was always a referee--stopped many bouts, and in most others, fighters ""tapped out,"" surrendering to mild-looking but agonizing chokes and joint locks. It was not barbarism. It was science. 

         The UFC spawned a new breed of ""mixed martial artists."" World-class wrestlers learned to kickbox. Champion kickboxers learned to grapple. (The karate experts learned to stay home.) They became, without doubt, the best fighters in the world. (Click for more about the fighters.) Mike Tyson wouldn't last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match. When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC, a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO'd him with a submission hold in 16 seconds. Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over the country, replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial arts with techniques that actually work. 

         UFC's promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as America's martial art. Instead, it fell apart. The collapse began in 1996, when Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., saw a UFC tape. McCain, a lifelong boxing fan, was horrified at the ground fighting, kicks, and head butts. It was ""barbaric,"" he said. It was ""not a sport."" He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting. The outcry against ""human cockfighting"" became a crusade, and like many crusades, it was founded on misunderstanding. 

         UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is. In countries such as Brazil and Japan, where no-holds-barred fighting has a long history, it is popular and uncontroversial. But Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules. A fight consists of an exchange of upper-body blows that halts when one fighter falls. 

         Any blood sport can be barbaric, whether it's boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting. It is impossible to draw a bright line between ultimate fighting and boxing. If anything, ultimate fighting is safer and less cruel than America's blood sport. For example, critics pilloried ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles: To a nation accustomed to boxing gloves, this seemed revolting, an invitation to brain damage. But it's just the reverse: The purpose of boxing gloves is not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles. Without gloves, a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull. That's why ultimate fighters won't throw multiple skull punches. As a result, they avoid the concussive head wounds that kill boxers--and the long-term neurological damage that cripples them. 

         Similarly, the chain-link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque. Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead. But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing: Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes, because nothing stops their heads from snapping back. The chain-link fence prevents hyperextension. 

         When I tell people I'm an ultimate fighting fan, they invariably respond: ""Don't people get killed all the time doing that?"" But no one has ever been killed at the UFC--though boxers are killed every year. No one has even been seriously injured at the UFC. On the rare occasions when a bout has ended with a bloody knockout, the loser has always walked out of the ring. 

         But this does not impress boxing fans, who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting. McCain sat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed. When I asked him to explain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting, he exploded at me, ""If you can't see the moral distinction, then we have nothing to talk about!"" Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office. 

         But logic has not served the UFC well. Where McCain led, a prudish nation followed. George Will opined against UFC. The American Medical Association recommended a ban. New York state outlawed ultimate fighting, as did other states. The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts, barring the UFC from the lucrative casino market. (One public TV station refused a UFC sponsorship ad. The only other organization the station ever rejected was the Ku Klux Klan.) Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over the country, forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees. The UFC was exiled from mega-arenas to ever-smaller venues in ever more out-of-the-way states: Louisiana, Iowa, and Alabama. The match I attended in October 1997 was held in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino. 

         The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow. In early 1997, McCain became chairman of the commerce committee, which oversees the cable industry. In April 1997, the president of the National Cable Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cable industry's influence in Washington. Time Warner, TCI, Request, Cablevision Systems, Viewer's Choice, and other major operators stopped airing UFC events, saying they were too violent for children. Never mind that 1) UFC only aired on pay-per-view, so children could not see it unless their parents paid for it; and 2) the same cable outfits carried boxing matches, R and NC-17 movies, and professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC. The UFC's ""addressable audience""--the potential number of PPV subscribers--shrank from 35 million at its peak to 7.5 million today. 

         ""It was a very cheap way for the cable companies to portray themselves as anti-violence. It did not cost them much and it made them look good in Washington,"" says Carol Klenfner, spokeswoman for UFC's parent company, SEG. 

         The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own cause. The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of carnage. Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting's potential for death. UFC folks accused McCain, without any evidence, of opposing the sport as a favor to campaign contributors. Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the other ultimate fighting operation, the now-defunct Battlecade, were arrested for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indian reservation outside Montreal. 

         In the past two years, an increasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics. The competition, which had been gradually adding safety rules since the first fight, imposed even more. It institued rounds and a ""10-point must"" scoring system. It banned head butts and groin strikes. You can no longer kick a downed man or elbow someone in the back of the head. Fighters are required to wear thin martial arts gloves (a purely cosmetic change). The UFC imposed weight classes, ending the David-and-Goliath mismatches that made early fights so compelling. 

         None of this soothed the cable operators, who have kept UFC off the air. The pay-per-view audience has plunged from 300,000 per show to 15,000. UFC can no longer afford its best fighters: Some are fighting overseas. Others, notably Ken Shamrock (Frank's brother), have become pro wrestlers. Fights have deteriorated. UFC is limping along, but it has been reduced to scheduling events in Japan and Brazil. 

         ""Sports fans want to grow with the sport,"" says former UFC fighter David Beneteau. ""They want to recognize the athletes. They want to see the same fighters come back. When you compare UFC now to what it was, the fighters are not the same, the rules are not the same. The fans have no story to follow."" 

         Even as it disappears from public view, ultimate fighting is returning to its roots. Away from the scrutiny of the major media, state legislators, and McCain, kids are still learning mixed martial-arts techniques, and small-time promoters are quietly staging events. You can see Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro, Calif. You can watch the Warrior's Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento. Texans compete in Houston's Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship. Tribal casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments. The Extreme Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa. The money is low; the crowds are small; and there's not a TV camera in sight. Ultimate fighting should have become boxing. Instead it has gone underground. It has become Fight Club.

36,"More Bang for the Buck 

         A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs. And the people were grateful. 

         That's probably because they're not getting all that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't score at all last year. 

         If that's true, many of us could use a little sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26 years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb (who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it? 

         And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance, located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares. 

         Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for $11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works. 

         It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line ""... and right ball go POW."" My wife hadn't noticed any difference at all. 

                         Overall rating, on a scale of 1 to 10: 2 toes curled.              

         A woman I know says women's magazines are the best places in America to find sex tips. She's right--go ahead, just try to find a sewing pattern in Redbook . You're much more likely to land on ""Try phone sex, dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,"" or articles such as ""Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged."" 

         An article in the April Cosmopolitan , ""The Six Best Sex Positions,"" seemed more promising than the Redbook playbook. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was ""The Butterfly,"" which we had to read three times to comprehend. The man stands, the woman remains supine on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could, for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen. 

                         Rating: 3 toes curled.              

         Next we tried those ""Better Sex"" instructional videos advertised in the New York Times                 Book Review. I ordered Better Sexual Techniques , Advanced Sexual Techniques , Making Sex Fun , and Advanced Oral Sex Techniques (priced about $11.95 each, not including shipping and handling). My wife couldn't bear to watch them; I persevered but must admit it was a chore. The oral-sex tape starts with ""well-known sex therapist"" Diana Wiley, in her poofy hair and broad-shouldered blue power suit, looking like she was about to explain how the sales force could increase its third-quarter productivity. Instead she runs through all the euphemisms for oral sex and then the video cuts to XXX action with gratuitous commentary. 

         Wiley's overexplanation of everything two people can do to each other with their mouths raises this question: Do you really need a five-minute video segment on whether or not to swallow? In the great tradition of hotel and travel ads, the guys tend to be markedly less attractive than the women. No way he'd be with her if this wasn't an instructional sex video!

Deb and I blocked off a whole Saturday afternoon and evening for the Intercourses experiment, settling on rosemary-scented lamb over pasta (Page 87) followed by frozen coffee almond dessert (Page 31). According to the book, rosemary is sexy because of its fragrance (used in many perfumes) and because of its texture, which, so the text assured, tickles nerve endings. The dessert was mostly coffee, rum, and Kahlua, which has worked before. 

         We shopped for the food together and cooked together, drinking wine and beer along the way. At one point while I was working on the dessert, I asked my wife how long to beat the heavy cream mixture. ""Till it's stiff--it's an aphrodisiac,"" she said. Preparation took less than an hour, and everything came out perfectly. Eating at our dining room table for the first time ever without guests, we were having fun by candlelight. But the mood was romantic, not erotic.

         That's when we went for the Viagra ($212.50 for 10 doses, which includes a ""consultation"" fee). The drug was prescribed by a doctor, whom I've never met, and ordered from a pharmacy in Miami Beach, Fla., where I've never been. I completed the transaction via the Internet after filling out a cover-their-ass questionnaire in three minutes. 

         We each decided to take one pill, clinked our glasses, and gulped. And then what? It felt awkward sitting in our bedroom, knowing that it could take up to an hour for Viagra to ""work.""

         St. Augustine held lust to be a fitting punishment for man's disobedience to God: the body's disobeying of the mind, the will, the spirit, and even of itself. (The paradigm of this for him is the unbidden hard-on.) Jean-Paul Sartre discovered something similar, although celebrating it rather than deploring it: Essential to the erotic is the body's defiance of design and control. (The paradigm of this for him is the jiggle.) Sartre's view yields a sort of sexual Heisenberg principle: There is an inherent tension between physically abandoning yourself to another on the one hand and sexual planning on the other. The more of the one, the less of the other. And this, I discovered, is the chief obstacle to sexual self-help. Getting an erection is sexy. Making one is not. As my wife said about Viagra, ""You start to have a new feeling and then you realize where it came from and then you don't have it so much. ... Anything that makes you think about it like that is just creepy."" 

         This is not to say there isn't a way out of this conflict between desire and design. With homage to our potent POTUS, there is, I think, a Third Way that's neither sexual complacency nor standard self-help. If the intrusion of consciousness is the problem, then maybe the answer is to block it out. Sure, you could do this the old-fashioned way: with alcohol and drugs. But then you have all the traditional drawbacks, including diminished physical attractiveness and degraded sexual performance. 

         So how about this instead? Go for all the sexual self-help you can, but do it covertly . Watch a sex video (or porn flick) if you want--but by yourself, and then try to share what you learned without sharing how you learned it. Don't tell your partner you took Viagra. Or give each other standing permission to slip it into the odd after-dinner drink, saying nothing. (Of course, when you do it you'll still know, but having an unselfconsciously turned-on partner is a real compensation for that, and next time, your partner can surprise you. And yes, this requires trust. But why would you be having sex with someone you don't trust?) My main conclusion is that contrary to our blabby culture, the key to a better sex life is less communication.

         A friend of mine offers a theory about why Bill Clinton's poll numbers stayed so high throughout the Lewinsky scandal: The news made it possible for serious-minded people to spend lots of time--at the office and over lunch--talking about semen stains, vaginal insertions, and blow jobs. And the people were grateful. 

         That's probably because they're not getting all that much themselves. A recent University of Chicago survey of 10,000 adults found that Americans are having considerably less sex than was generally thought. Only one American in 20 has sex three times a week. One in five didn't score at all last year. 

         If that's true, many of us could use a little sexual self-improvement. Not me, of course. I have been happily married for 26 years, since the age of 21. Deb and I have what seems to us to be a perfectly fine amorous life, yet everywhere I turn the culture tells me--almost mocks me-- you can do better! What would happen to our sex life then, if Deb (who participated in this story because she loves me and because she has tenure) and I tried for the first time to make something happen to it? 

         And so it was that we found ourselves for the first time ever in a sex-toy store, A Touch of Romance, located near our home in Los Angeles, across the street from a Macy's. The idea behind shops like these is to make obtaining the materials of sexual experimentation as ordinary as purchasing plumbing supplies or housewares. 

         Which sort of works--the only sexual thrill I got from the visit was knowing that Microsoft just bought a cock ring. Choosing it wasn't easy. Most of them came in presized sets of three. I couldn't figure out which would fit right and intuited that try-ons weren't an option. So I opted instead for an adjustable circumference version, a little strip of vinyl with snaps for $11.95. Man, what a rip-off! Unless it works. 

         It doesn't. Back home, I derived a certain depraved buzz in cinching the device on, but that was soon eclipsed. The thing works on the Roach Motel principle--your blood gets in but it can't get out. But then I got to thinking: Under battlefield conditions it doesn't get out anyway. And while I should have been paying more attention to other things, this led to thinking about the old joke with the punch line ""... and right ball go POW."" My wife hadn't noticed any difference at all.

         A woman I know says women's magazines are the best places in America to find sex tips. She's right--go ahead, just try to find a sewing pattern in Redbook . You're much more likely to land on ""Try phone sex, dirty notes, porn videos, fantasy games and sex in new places. ... Try lingerie and no underwear. ... Try talking dirty and silk scarves. Try anything at all,"" or articles such as ""Eight New Games for the Foreplay Challenged."" 

         An article in the April Cosmopolitan , ""The Six Best Sex Positions,"" seemed more promising than the Redbook playbook. Each position was accompanied by a succinct write-up and a stick-figure diagram. The position we settled on was ""The Butterfly,"" which we had to read three times to comprehend. The man stands, the woman remains supine on a bed or counter-top with her feet up on his shoulders. The whole idea is to produce a pelvic tilt for better access to the G spot. Instead, we experienced an uncomfortable pretzel feeling that stick figures must be immune to. And in general, Cosmopolitan 's exotic sex positions require the sort of body placement you can't remember in the moment of passion and even if you could, for proper alignment, you still might need mood-killing accessories such as a plumb line and a laser pen.

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life. 

         But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U-Haul. If he had tried to rent from U-Haul, he never would have escaped from Tibet. (For the complete back story, see ""Shopping Avenger"" column and one.) 

         The complaints about U-Haul's nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail. One correspondent, B.R., wrote in with this cautionary tale: ""Last weekend, I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house. My brother had reserved a moving truck with U-Haul for the big day. I warned my brother about U-Haul's 'not really a reservation per se' policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger. He didn't believe such a thing would happen to him, so he didn't act on my warning."" 

         B.R. continues--as if you don't know what happened already--""I went to U-Haul with my brother to get our 'reserved' truck. The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated. When we got to the front of the line, the clerk informed us that our 'reserved' truck had not yet been returned. We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot. The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost."" 

         B.R. and his chastened brother--the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat--went to Ryder. ""Ryder had a truck available for us. The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U-Haul is not."" 

         The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U-Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U-Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks, but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that, based on what they have read in this column, they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere. 

         The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U-Haul in the next episode, but now on to this month's airline debacle. 

         Before we begin, though, the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month's contest, in which readers were asked to answer the question, ""What's the difference between pests and airlines?"" 

         The winner is one Tom Morgan, who wrote, ""You can hire someone to kill pests."" Tom is the winner of a year's supply of Turtle Wax, and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year's supply. The new contest question: How much Turtle Wax comprises a year's supply of Turtle Wax? 

         This month's airline in the spotlight is Southwest. Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its ""sterling"" customer service. This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions. The most articulate, and the most troubling, came from M., who wrote, ""Last year, flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family (two really little kids included), we set down at Midway in a rainstorm. And waited for our bags. And waited for bags. And waited for bags."" 

         An hour later, M. says, the bags showed up, ""soaked through. We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated, unclear, and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen."" 

         When they arrived at their destination, M. and her family made a terrible discovery, ""We discovered that our clothes were soaked through--the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels, destroying lots of other clothes. Obviously, our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain. To this day, I've never heard a thing from SW, despite calls and letters."" 

         This, of course, is where Shopping Avenger steps in. Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline, in that it doesn't go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers (see: ), so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M.'s problem. 

         What I got at first, though, was a load of corporate hoo-ha. 

         ""The airline's policy, which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines, requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination,"" a Southwest spokeswoman, Linda Rutherford, e-mailed me. ""[M.] indicates she called for a few days, but did not file a report in person until April 12--three days later. Southwest, as a courtesy, took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage."" Rutherford said that M. should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim. 

         Harrumph, the Shopping Avenger says. It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines. I forwarded this message to M., who replied: 

         ""Wow. Well, of course I didn't file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn't know the clothes were ruined at the airport. I didn't know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff. (And it's worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in-laws nipping at our heels.)"" 

         She goes on, ""I did call that evening ... and was told that that sufficed. This is the first time I've been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours. ... When I filed on the 12 th , I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation. The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this. ... They know that the type of 'evidence' they want is impossible to obtain. They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time."" 

         Southwest's response actually served to anger M. more than the original problem. ""Before, they had a mildly annoyed but loyal customer (who would have been placated by an apology and thrilled with some modest token of their regret). Now they have a pissed-off customer."" 

         Things do look bad for Southwest, don't they? The Shopping Avenger sent M.'s response to Rutherford, who e-mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for ""policy information."" The Shopping Avenger e-mailed back again, stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would, if this case were brought to trial, undoubtedly find for the plaintiff (the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor, judge, and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice--defendants are represented by the president of U-Haul), and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck. 

         But then she came through, provisionally, ""Yep, you can be sure if [M.] will call me we will get everything squared away. I'm sorry it's taken this long for her to get someone who can help, but we will take care of it from here."" 

         Stay tuned, shoppers, to hear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M. and apologize to her for her troubles. 

         The story of M. reminds the Shopping Avenger of a central truth of consumer service: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. 

         Take the case of K., who found himself waiting in vain for Circuit City to repair his television. Televisions break, even 1-year-old televisions, as is the case with K's. But Circuit City, where he bought the television, gave him a terrible runaround. The Shopping Avenger dispatched his sidekick, Tad the Deputy Avenger, to get to the bottom of K.'s story. This is what he found: K. grew concerned, Tad the Deputy Avenger reports, after his television had been in the Circuit City shop for a week. When he called, he was told to ""check back next week."" When he asked if someone from the store could call him with more information, he was refused. Weeks went by. When K. told one Circuit City employee that he really would like to get his television back, the employee, K. says, asked him, ""Don't you have another television in your house?"" 

         More than a month later--after hours and hours and hours of telephone calls and days missed at work--K. received his television back. 

         Mistakes happen, but not, Tad the Deputy Avenger found out, at Circuit City. The case, K. was told by a Circuit City official, was ""handled perfectly."" Another official, Morgan Stewart in public relations, assured Deputy Avenger Tad that ""We got to be a big and successful company by treating customers better than the other guy."" The Shopping Avenger and his loyal sidekick would like to hear from other Circuit City customers: Does Circuit City, in fact, treat its customers better than the other guy? 

         Stay tuned for answers. And next month, a Shopping Avenger clergy special: TWA screws with a Hasidic rabbi's travel plans, leaving the rabbi's wife crying at the airport. Find out if the Shopping Avenger can save TWA from certain heavenly punishment, in the next episode.

37,"It's Time To Keelhaul U-Haul! 

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life.

",6,What term best describes this writing?,2,Satire.,1,Essay.
38,"A Good Year for the Roses? 

         Early in American Beauty , Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a weary reporter for a media magazine, masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that we're witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something,"" says Lester. ""I'm not exactly sure what it is but I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently, Lester doesn't realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses, convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby. 

         The movie is convinced, too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware, and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, ""Yeah! Tell that bitch off!"" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the director, Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. 

         A merican                 Beauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn, is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans, Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" 

         But it's also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago, Daniel Menaker in                    Slate                 in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" That's the theme here, too, and it's extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989), the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up, down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bag's trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end, Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit they're smoking. 

         It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain, turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it. You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, ""Shut up--you're weak--shut up. "" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. 

                         American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's ""loserness."" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably rhapsodic moments straight. 

         But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. 

         Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis, the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument,"" as it were. In For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies. 

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said, ""Bean me.""

He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something,"" says Lester. ""I'm not exactly sure what it is but I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently, Lester doesn't realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses, convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby. 

         The movie is convinced, too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware, and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, ""Yeah! Tell that bitch off!"" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the director, Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. 

         A merican                 Beauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn, is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans, Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" 

         But it's also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago, Daniel Menaker in                    Slate                 in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" That's the theme here, too, and it's extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989), the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up, down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bag's trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end, Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit they're smoking. 

         It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain, turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it. You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, ""Shut up--you're weak--shut up. "" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. 

                         American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's ""loserness."" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably rhapsodic moments straight. 

         But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. 

         Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis, the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument,"" as it were. In For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies. 

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said, ""Bean me.""

39,"Machines in the Garden 

         In the animated ecological epic                    Princess Mononoke                , the camera travels over landscapes with a clear, steady gaze, like a Zen hang glider. The images have none of the comin'-at-ya pop-surrealism of American cartoons, many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack-in-the-boxes. The Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself, seems to work from the outside in: to begin with the curve of the earth, then the mossy hills, the watercolor foliage, the nubby stones, the whorls on the wood, the meticulous carvings on a teacup. He captures the texture of light and the currents of air. You could almost settle down in this landscape. A view of nature that some would call ""tree-hugging"" doesn't feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail. 

         But then, ""soft"" is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke , however pantheistic its worldview. The film, which is rated PG-13, is full of splattery carnage. If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative, in close-up he's ferocious. He's both inside and outside the action: He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment. According to the New                 York Times , Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged, and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features. Watching Princess                 Mononoke --which has been dubbed to Disney/Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two-hour-plus length, its gory beheadings, and its grim, near-apocalyptic finale--you can understand their worship. It isn't that Miyazaki's work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles; it's that everything is sublimely in proportion. 

         The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood's homiletic, follow-your-dream fables look even more solipsistic. Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history (the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries) when the power shifted from a ""natural"" world to one shaped by human technology. It's the beginning of what Bill McKibben called ""the end of nature""--that is, when nature became no longer an autonomous, self-regulating force but one touched (and, in Miyazaki's view, poisoned) by human industry. 

         The hero, Ashitaka, a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan, is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar--a god turned into a demon (covered in roiling, corrosive worms) by an iron ball lodged in its body. Infected, destined to be consumed by--and to die of--rage, Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball's source. He discovers a fortress-cum-arms-manufacturing plant called Irontown, presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film: the regal Lady Eboshi. On one hand, she's a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society; on the other, she wants to destroy the forest, harness its resources, and exterminate its animal deities--chiefly the Spirit of the Forest, a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death, and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker. 

         P rincess Mononoke builds to a full-scale war between humans and the animal kingdom--which does not, by the way, consist of your father's cartoon critters. In fact, the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka's call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony; they'd like to eat him. The wolf god, Moro, is slightly more sympathetic, but that's because her adopted ""daughter,"" San (a k a Princess Mononoke), is human. San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother, then, as the gore drips from her mouth, training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred. Her second appearance--a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi--is one of the movie's high points. It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away: the determined tap of the wolf princess's shoes as she scuttles over the fortress's rooftops; the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky. Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition--it's almost subliminal. 

         It's a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him. She loses that punk-bitch allure. The voice of Claire Danes doesn't help. When Danes says, ""I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest,"" she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall. (San needs a more ragged voice--I'd be interested to hear the original Japanese actress.) Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied (Miramaxed?), but that doesn't hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ingÃ©nu. Gillian Anderson's growling Moro sounds silly (she doesn't have the breath control), and the fey-hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff-like mercenary, Jigo. But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?""

The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.)

         In the animated ecological epic                    Princess Mononoke                , the camera travels over landscapes with a clear, steady gaze, like a Zen hang glider. The images have none of the comin'-at-ya pop-surrealism of American cartoons, many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack-in-the-boxes. The Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself, seems to work from the outside in: to begin with the curve of the earth, then the mossy hills, the watercolor foliage, the nubby stones, the whorls on the wood, the meticulous carvings on a teacup. He captures the texture of light and the currents of air. You could almost settle down in this landscape. A view of nature that some would call ""tree-hugging"" doesn't feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail. 

         But then, ""soft"" is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke , however pantheistic its worldview. The film, which is rated PG-13, is full of splattery carnage. If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative, in close-up he's ferocious. He's both inside and outside the action: He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment. According to the New                 York Times , Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged, and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features. Watching Princess                 Mononoke --which has been dubbed to Disney/Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two-hour-plus length, its gory beheadings, and its grim, near-apocalyptic finale--you can understand their worship. It isn't that Miyazaki's work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles; it's that everything is sublimely in proportion. 

         The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood's homiletic, follow-your-dream fables look even more solipsistic. Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history (the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries) when the power shifted from a ""natural"" world to one shaped by human technology. It's the beginning of what Bill McKibben called ""the end of nature""--that is, when nature became no longer an autonomous, self-regulating force but one touched (and, in Miyazaki's view, poisoned) by human industry. 

         The hero, Ashitaka, a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan, is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar--a god turned into a demon (covered in roiling, corrosive worms) by an iron ball lodged in its body. Infected, destined to be consumed by--and to die of--rage, Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball's source. He discovers a fortress-cum-arms-manufacturing plant called Irontown, presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film: the regal Lady Eboshi. On one hand, she's a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society; on the other, she wants to destroy the forest, harness its resources, and exterminate its animal deities--chiefly the Spirit of the Forest, a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death, and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker. 

         P rincess Mononoke builds to a full-scale war between humans and the animal kingdom--which does not, by the way, consist of your father's cartoon critters. In fact, the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka's call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony; they'd like to eat him. The wolf god, Moro, is slightly more sympathetic, but that's because her adopted ""daughter,"" San (a k a Princess Mononoke), is human. San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother, then, as the gore drips from her mouth, training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred. Her second appearance--a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi--is one of the movie's high points. It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away: the determined tap of the wolf princess's shoes as she scuttles over the fortress's rooftops; the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky. Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition--it's almost subliminal. 

         It's a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him. She loses that punk-bitch allure. The voice of Claire Danes doesn't help. When Danes says, ""I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest,"" she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall. (San needs a more ragged voice--I'd be interested to hear the original Japanese actress.) Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied (Miramaxed?), but that doesn't hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ingÃ©nu. Gillian Anderson's growling Moro sounds silly (she doesn't have the breath control), and the fey-hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff-like mercenary, Jigo. But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?"" The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, would be worth seeing just for Stamp's performance, at once rock-hard and goofily blinkered, and for Peter Fonda's wittily self-parodic turn as the suspected killer, a music producer who coasts on '60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work. (""Oh, man,"" he says, the fear finally seeping through the ether. ""This is getting all too close to me."") 

         But the picture's glory is its layered and intricate syntax. The dialogue moves ahead--there are great gobs of exposition--but the images continually double back: to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, as his daughter's acting teacher, simply gazing at each other; or to Stamp sitting on a plane, remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach, the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright--almost supernatural--spot that dances over her face. The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.) The rest is only half-glimpsed, fantasized, or saturated by memory--or is the present the memory? Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup? 

         Some, including the critic at Time , have questioned Soderbergh's sanity. (But of course--Soderbergh flouts time!) I see a method to his madness. Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey-Boy , Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture. He's saying: This --not all that other stuff--is what's important. He telegraphs the ending--you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter's death--but it's still an emotional wow.

But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?"" The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, would be worth seeing just for Stamp's performance, at once rock-hard and goofily blinkered, and for Peter Fonda's wittily self-parodic turn as the suspected killer, a music producer who coasts on '60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work. (""Oh, man,"" he says, the fear finally seeping through the ether. ""This is getting all too close to me."") 

         But the picture's glory is its layered and intricate syntax. The dialogue moves ahead--there are great gobs of exposition--but the images continually double back: to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, as his daughter's acting teacher, simply gazing at each other; or to Stamp sitting on a plane, remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach, the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright--almost supernatural--spot that dances over her face. The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.) The rest is only half-glimpsed, fantasized, or saturated by memory--or is the present the memory? Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup? 

         Some, including the critic at Time , have questioned Soderbergh's sanity. (But of course--Soderbergh flouts time!) I see a method to his madness. Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey-Boy , Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture. He's saying: This --not all that other stuff--is what's important. He telegraphs the ending--you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter's death--but it's still an emotional wow. The climax justifies the technique. It says the point of this odyssey isn't revenge but regret--for irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love. 

         Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learn on the job. Working within a tight genre structure, he's discovering hundreds of ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel. Is he totally successful? No; he misses now and then, which is why the technique sticks out. But what a fantastic effort. See it and weep for what's missing in most other movies.

         Fight Club is silly stuff, sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire, but it's also a brash and transporting piece of moviemaking, like Raging Bull on acid. The film opens with--literally--a surge of adrenalin, which travels through the bloodstream and into the brain of its protagonist, Jack (Edward Norton), who's viewed, as the camera pulls out of his insides, with a gun stuck in his mouth. How'd he get into this pickle? He's going to tell you, breezily, and the director, David Fincher, is going to illustrate his narrative--violently. Fincher ( Seven , 1995; The Game , 1997) is out to bombard you with so much feverish imagery that you have no choice but to succumb to the movie's reeling, punch-drunk worldview. By the end, you might feel as if you, too, have a mouthful of blood. 

         Not to mention a hole in your head. Fight Club careers from one resonant satirical idea to the next without quite deciding whether its characters are full of crap or are Gen X prophets. It always gives you a rush, though. At first, it goofs on the absurd feminization of an absurdly macho culture. An increasingly desperate insomniac, Jack finds relief (and release) only at meetings for the terminally ill. At a testicular cancer group, he's enfolded in the ample arms of Bob (the singer Meat Loaf Aday), a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now has ""bitch tits."" Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding: They cling to each other and sob. But Jack's idyll is rudely disrupted by--wouldn't you know it?--a woman. A dark-eyed, sepulchral head case named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings for essentially the same voyeuristic ends, and the presence of this ""tourist"" makes it impossible for Jack to emote. 

         Jack finds another outlet, though. On a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cryptic hipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large (he makes high-priced soaps from liposuctioned human fat) and small (he splices frames from porn flicks into kiddie movies). When Jack's apartment mysteriously explodes--along with his carefully chosen IKEA furniture--he moves into Tyler's squalid warehouse and helps to found a new religion: Fight Club, in which young males gather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another (and be pounded) to a bloody pulp. That last parenthesis isn't so parenthetical. In some ways, it's the longing to be beaten into oblivion that's the strongest. ""Self-improvement,"" explains Tyler, ""is masturbation""; self-destruction is the new way. Tyler's manifesto calls for an end to consumerism (""Things you own end up owning you""), and since society is going down (""Martha Stewart is polishing brass on the Titanic ""), the only creative outlet left is annihilation. ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,"" he says. 

         Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, seem to think they've broken new ground in Fight                 Club , that their metaphor for our discontents hits harder than anyone else's. Certainly it produces more bloody splatter. But 20 years ago, the same impulse was called punk and, as Greil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces , it was other things before that. Yes, the mixture of Johnny Rotten, Jake La Motta, and Jesus is unique; and the Faludi-esque emasculation themes are more explicit. But there's something deeply movie-ish about the whole conceit, as if the novelist and director were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming of recapturing that first masochistic rush. 

         The novel, the first by Chuck Palahniuk (the surname sounds like Eskimo for ""palooka""--which somehow fits), walks a line between the straight and ironic--it isn't always clear if its glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as the ravings of a delusional mama's boy. But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the assembled fighters that they are the ""middle children of history"" with ""no purpose and no place""--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis (a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel. ""We are a generation of men raised by women,"" Tyler announces, and adds, ""If our fathers bail, what does that tell you about God?"" (I give up: What?) 

         F ight                 Club could use a few different perspectives: a woman's, obviously, but also an African-American's--someone who'd have a different take on the ""healing"" properties of violence. It's also unclear just what has emasculated Jack: Is it that he's a materialist or that the materials themselves (i.e., IKEA's lacquered particle boards) don't measure up to his fantasies of opulence? Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envy? Tyler's subsequent idea of confining his group's mayhem to franchise coffee bars and corporate-subsidized art is a witty one--it's like a parody of neo-Nazism as re-enacted by yuppies. It might have been a howl if performed by, say, the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski (1998). Somehow Brad Pitt doesn't have the same piquancy. 

         Actually, Pitt isn't as terrible as usual: He's playing not a character but a conceit, and he can bask in his movie-idol arrogance, which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has. But the film belongs to Norton. As a ferocious skinhead in last year's American History X , Norton was taut and ropy, his long torso curled into a sneer; here, he's skinny and wilting, a quivering pansy. Even when he fights he doesn't transform--he's a raging wimp. The performance is marvelous, and it makes poetic sense in light of the movie's climactic twist. But that twist will annoy more people than it will delight, if only because it shifts the drama from the realm of the sociological to that of the psychoanalytic. The finale, scored with the Pixies' great ""Where Is My Mind?"" comes off facetiously--as if Fincher is throwing the movie away. 

         Until then, however, he has done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning. The most thrilling thing about Fight Club isn't what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into its narrator's head and simulate his adrenalin rushes. A veteran of rock videos, Fincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTV--along with digital editing--has transformed cinema for better as well as worse. The syntax has become more intricate. Voice-over narration, once considered uncinematic, is back in style, along with novelistic asides, digressions, fantasies, and flashbacks. To make a point, you can jazzily interject anything--even, as in Three Kings , a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs. Films like Fight Club might not gel, but they have a breathless, free-associational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling. Or maybe old possibilities: The language of movies hasn't seemed this unfettered since the pre-sound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance. 

         An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the most rapturous performances I've ever seen as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena (a k a Teena Brandon) in Kimberly Peirce's stark and astonishingly beautiful debut feature,                    Boys Don't Cry                . The movie opens with Teena being shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming ""Brandon,"" who swaggers around in tight jeans and leather jackets. The joy is in watching the actor transform, and I don't just mean Swank: I mean Teena Brandon playing Brandon Teena--the role she has been longing for her whole life. In a redneck Nebraska bar, Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesture--a macho cliché--becomes an act of self-discovery. Every gesture does. ""You're gonna have a shiner in the morning,"" someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl, and he takes the news with a glee that's almost mystical: ""I am????? Oh, shit!!!"" he cries, grinning. That might be my favorite moment in the picture, because Swank's ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour, as Brandon acts out his urban-cowboy fantasies--""surfing"" from the bumper of a pickup truck, rolling in the mud, and straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski and the other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe. 

         That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and into something more complex and irreducible: a meditation on the irrelevance of gender. Peirce's triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberant (occasionally hilarious) and foreboding, so that all the seeds of Brandon's killing are right there on the screen. John (Peter Sarsgaard), one of his future rapists and murderers, calls him ""little buddy"" and seems almost attracted to him; Sarsgaard's performance is a finely chiseled study of how unresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence. 

         Though harrowing, the second half of Boys Don't Cry isn't as great as the first. The early scenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously, the later ones just dread; and the last half-hour is unrelieved torture. What keeps the movie tantalizing is Chloë Sevigny's Lana, who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl but who's entranced by him anyway. With her lank hair, hooded eyes, and air of sleepy sensuality, Sevigny--maybe even more than Swank--embodies the mystery of sex that's at the core of Boys Don't Cry . Everything she does is deliberate, ironic, slightly unreadable--and unyielding. She's could be saying, ""I'm in this world but not of it. ... You'd never dream what's underneath."" 

         I n                 brief: If a friend tells you you'll love                    Happy Texas                , rethink the friendship. This clunky mistaken-identity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageant directors doesn't even make sense on its own low farcical terms; it's mostly one lame homo joke after another. The only bright spot is Steve Zahn, who could be the offspring of Michael J. Fox and Crispin Glover if they'd mated on the set of Back to the Future (1985). 

         It's hard to make a serious case for Lawrence Kasdan's                    Mumford                , which has apparently flopped but which you can still catch at second- and third-tier theaters. It looks peculiar--a Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows. And its tale of a small town healed by a depressive (Loren Dean) posing as a psychologist is full of doddering misconceptions about psychotherapy. I almost don't know why I loved it, but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short, Ted Danson, David Paymer, and Mary McDonnell surely helped. I can't decide if the weirdly affectless Dean is inspired or inept, but my indecision suggests why he works in the role. There's no doubt, however, about his even more depressive love object, Hope Davis, who posseses the cinema's most expressive honking-nasal voice and who slumps through the movie like the world's most lyrical anti-ballerina. Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent: They made me think of Mumford as the home of the psychological mumps.

At a testicular cancer group, he's enfolded in the ample arms of Bob (the singer Meat Loaf Aday), a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now has ""bitch tits."" Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding: They cling to each other and sob. But Jack's idyll is rudely disrupted by--wouldn't you know it?--a woman. A dark-eyed, sepulchral head case named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings for essentially the same voyeuristic ends, and the presence of this ""tourist"" makes it impossible for Jack to emote. 

         Jack finds another outlet, though. On a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cryptic hipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large (he makes high-priced soaps from liposuctioned human fat) and small (he splices frames from porn flicks into kiddie movies). When Jack's apartment mysteriously explodes--along with his carefully chosen IKEA furniture--he moves into Tyler's squalid warehouse and helps to found a new religion: Fight Club, in which young males gather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another (and be pounded) to a bloody pulp. That last parenthesis isn't so parenthetical. In some ways, it's the longing to be beaten into oblivion that's the strongest. ""Self-improvement,"" explains Tyler, ""is masturbation""; self-destruction is the new way. Tyler's manifesto calls for an end to consumerism (""Things you own end up owning you""), and since society is going down (""Martha Stewart is polishing brass on the Titanic ""), the only creative outlet left is annihilation. ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,"" he says. 

         Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, seem to think they've broken new ground in Fight                 Club , that their metaphor for our discontents hits harder than anyone else's. Certainly it produces more bloody splatter. But 20 years ago, the same impulse was called punk and, as Greil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces , it was other things before that. Yes, the mixture of Johnny Rotten, Jake La Motta, and Jesus is unique; and the Faludi-esque emasculation themes are more explicit. But there's something deeply movie-ish about the whole conceit, as if the novelist and director were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming of recapturing that first masochistic rush. 

         The novel, the first by Chuck Palahniuk (the surname sounds like Eskimo for ""palooka""--which somehow fits), walks a line between the straight and ironic--it isn't always clear if its glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as the ravings of a delusional mama's boy. But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the assembled fighters that they are the ""middle children of history"" with ""no purpose and no place""--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis (a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel. ""We are a generation of men raised by women,"" Tyler announces, and adds, ""If our fathers bail, what does that tell you about God?"" (I give up: What?) 

         F ight                 Club could use a few different perspectives: a woman's, obviously, but also an African-American's--someone who'd have a different take on the ""healing"" properties of violence. It's also unclear just what has emasculated Jack: Is it that he's a materialist or that the materials themselves (i.e., IKEA's lacquered particle boards) don't measure up to his fantasies of opulence? Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envy? Tyler's subsequent idea of confining his group's mayhem to franchise coffee bars and corporate-subsidized art is a witty one--it's like a parody of neo-Nazism as re-enacted by yuppies. It might have been a howl if performed by, say, the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski (1998). Somehow Brad Pitt doesn't have the same piquancy. 

         Actually, Pitt isn't as terrible as usual: He's playing not a character but a conceit, and he can bask in his movie-idol arrogance, which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has. But the film belongs to Norton. As a ferocious skinhead in last year's American History X , Norton was taut and ropy, his long torso curled into a sneer; here, he's skinny and wilting, a quivering pansy. Even when he fights he doesn't transform--he's a raging wimp. The performance is marvelous, and it makes poetic sense in light of the movie's climactic twist. But that twist will annoy more people than it will delight, if only because it shifts the drama from the realm of the sociological to that of the psychoanalytic. The finale, scored with the Pixies' great ""Where Is My Mind?"" comes off facetiously--as if Fincher is throwing the movie away. 

         Until then, however, he has done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning. The most thrilling thing about Fight Club isn't what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into its narrator's head and simulate his adrenalin rushes. A veteran of rock videos, Fincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTV--along with digital editing--has transformed cinema for better as well as worse. The syntax has become more intricate. Voice-over narration, once considered uncinematic, is back in style, along with novelistic asides, digressions, fantasies, and flashbacks. To make a point, you can jazzily interject anything--even, as in Three Kings , a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs. Films like Fight Club might not gel, but they have a breathless, free-associational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling. Or maybe old possibilities: The language of movies hasn't seemed this unfettered since the pre-sound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance. 

         An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the most rapturous performances I've ever seen as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena (a k a Teena Brandon) in Kimberly Peirce's stark and astonishingly beautiful debut feature,                    Boys Don't Cry                . The movie opens with Teena being shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming ""Brandon,"" who swaggers around in tight jeans and leather jackets. The joy is in watching the actor transform, and I don't just mean Swank: I mean Teena Brandon playing Brandon Teena--the role she has been longing for her whole life. In a redneck Nebraska bar, Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesture--a macho cliché--becomes an act of self-discovery. Every gesture does. ""You're gonna have a shiner in the morning,"" someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl, and he takes the news with a glee that's almost mystical: ""I am????? Oh, shit!!!"" he cries, grinning. That might be my favorite moment in the picture, because Swank's ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour, as Brandon acts out his urban-cowboy fantasies--""surfing"" from the bumper of a pickup truck, rolling in the mud, and straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski and the other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe. 

         That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and into something more complex and irreducible: a meditation on the irrelevance of gender. Peirce's triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberant (occasionally hilarious) and foreboding, so that all the seeds of Brandon's killing are right there on the screen. John (Peter Sarsgaard), one of his future rapists and murderers, calls him ""little buddy"" and seems almost attracted to him; Sarsgaard's performance is a finely chiseled study of how unresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence. 

         Though harrowing, the second half of Boys Don't Cry isn't as great as the first. The early scenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously, the later ones just dread; and the last half-hour is unrelieved torture. What keeps the movie tantalizing is Chloë Sevigny's Lana, who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl but who's entranced by him anyway. With her lank hair, hooded eyes, and air of sleepy sensuality, Sevigny--maybe even more than Swank--embodies the mystery of sex that's at the core of Boys Don't Cry . Everything she does is deliberate, ironic, slightly unreadable--and unyielding. She's could be saying, ""I'm in this world but not of it. ... You'd never dream what's underneath."" 

         I n                 brief: If a friend tells you you'll love                    Happy Texas                , rethink the friendship. This clunky mistaken-identity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageant directors doesn't even make sense on its own low farcical terms; it's mostly one lame homo joke after another. The only bright spot is Steve Zahn, who could be the offspring of Michael J. Fox and Crispin Glover if they'd mated on the set of Back to the Future (1985). 

         It's hard to make a serious case for Lawrence Kasdan's                    Mumford                , which has apparently flopped but which you can still catch at second- and third-tier theaters. It looks peculiar--a Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows. And its tale of a small town healed by a depressive (Loren Dean) posing as a psychologist is full of doddering misconceptions about psychotherapy. I almost don't know why I loved it, but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short, Ted Danson, David Paymer, and Mary McDonnell surely helped. I can't decide if the weirdly affectless Dean is inspired or inept, but my indecision suggests why he works in the role. There's no doubt, however, about his even more depressive love object, Hope Davis, who posseses the cinema's most expressive honking-nasal voice and who slumps through the movie like the world's most lyrical anti-ballerina. Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent: They made me think of Mumford as the home of the psychological mumps.

41,"A Good Year for the Roses? 

         Early in American Beauty , Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a weary reporter for a media magazine, masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that we're witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something,"" says Lester. ""I'm not exactly sure what it is but I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently, Lester doesn't realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses, convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby. 

         The movie is convinced, too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware, and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, ""Yeah! Tell that bitch off!"" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the director, Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. 

         A merican                 Beauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn, is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans, Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" 

         But it's also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago, Daniel Menaker in                    Slate                 in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" That's the theme here, too, and it's extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989), the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up, down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bag's trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end, Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit they're smoking. 

         It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain, turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it. You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, ""Shut up--you're weak--shut up. "" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. 

                         American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's ""loserness."" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably rhapsodic moments straight. 

         But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. 

         Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis, the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument,"" as it were. In For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies. 

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said, ""Bean me.""

41,"A Good Year for the Roses? 

         Early in American Beauty , Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), a weary reporter for a media magazine, masturbates in the shower while informing us in voice-over that we're witnessing the highlight of his day. He peers through tired eyes out the window at his manicured suburban tract-house lawn, where his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening)--whose gardening clogs, he points out, are color-coordinated with the handles of her shears--snips roses (American beauties) and twitters about Miracle-Gro to a gay yuppie (Scott Bakula) on the other side of a white picket fence. ""I have lost something,"" says Lester. ""I'm not exactly sure what it is but I know I didn't always feel this ... sedated."" Apparently, Lester doesn't realize that snipped roses are garden-variety symbols of castration, or he'd know what he has lost. But the makers of American Beauty are about to give Lester his roses back. At a high-school basketball game, Lester is transfixed by a blonde cheerleader named Angela (Mena Suvari), who is twirling alongside his daughter, Jane (Thora Burch). Ambient noise falls away, the crowd disappears, and there she is, Lester's angel, writhing in slow motion--just for him. She opens her jacket (she's naked underneath) and red rose petals drift out. Later, Lester envisions her on a bed of red petals, then immersed in a bath of red petals. Back in the roses for the first time in years, he's soon pumping iron, smoking pot, and telling off his frigid wife and faceless bosses, convinced that whatever he has lost he's getting back, baby. 

         The movie is convinced, too--which is odd, since the fantasy of an underage cheerleader making a middle-aged man's wilted roses bloom is a tad ... primitive. But American Beauty doesn't feel primitive. It feels lustrously hip and aware, and a lot of critics are making big claims for it. The script, by Alan Ball, a playwright and former sitcom writer, carries an invigorating blast of counterculture righteousness, along with the kind of pithily vicious marital bickering that makes some viewers (especially male) say, ""Yeah! Tell that bitch off!"" More important, it has a vein of metaphysical yearning, which the director, Sam Mendes, mines brilliantly. A hotshot English theater director (his Cabaret revival is still on the boards in New York), Mendes gives the film a patina of New Age lyricism and layer upon layer of visual irony. The movie's surface is velvety and immaculate--until the action is abruptly viewed through the video camera of the teen-age voyeur next door (Wes Bentley), and the graininess of the video image (along with the plangent music) suggests how unstable the molecules that constitute our ""reality"" really are. Mendes can distend the real into the surreal with imperceptible puffs. Aided by his cinematographer, Conrad Hall, and editors, Tariq Anwar and Chris Greenbury, he creates an entrancing vision of the American nuclear family on the verge of a meltdown. 

         A merican                 Beauty is so wittily written and gorgeously directed that you might think you're seeing something archetypal--maybe even the Great American Movie. But when you stop and smell the roses ... Well, that scent isn't Miracle-Gro. The hairpin turns from farce to melodrama, from satire to bathos, are fresh and deftly navigated, but almost every one of the underlying attitudes is smug and easy: from the corporate flunky named ""Brad"" to the interchangeable gay neighbors (they're both called ""Jim"") to the brutally homophobic patriarch next door, an ex-Marine colonel (Chris Cooper) who has reduced his wife (the normally exuberant Allison Janney) to a catatonic mummy and his son, Ricky (Bentley), to a life of subterranean deception. (The colonel's idea of bliss is watching an old Ronald Reagan military picture on television: How's that for subtle?) Lester's wife, Carolyn, is even more stridently caricatured. A real-estate broker who fails to sell a big house (her only potential customers are blank-faced African-Americans, Indian-Americans, and surly lesbians), she wears a mask of perky efficiency and insists on listening to Muzak while she and her husband and daughter eat her ""nutritious yet savory"" dinners. It's amazing that Mendes and Ball get away with recycling so many stale and reactionary ideas under the all-purpose rubric of ""black comedy."" 

         But it's also possible that those ideas have rarely been presented so seductively. Several months ago, Daniel Menaker in                    Slate                 in contemporary film in which the protagonist attempts to break through our cultural and technological anesthetization into ""the real."" That's the theme here, too, and it's extraordinarily potent, at times even heartbreaking. The symbols, however, have been cunningly reversed. In movies like sex, lies, and videotape (1989), the protagonist has to put away the video camera to ""get real""; in American Beauty , it's Ricky Fitts, the damaged stoner videomaker next door, who sees beauty where nonartists see only horror or nothingness. In the film's most self-consciously poetic set piece, Ricky shows Lester's dour daughter Jane--in whom he recognizes a kindred spirit--a video of a plastic bag fluttering up, down, and around on invisible currents of wind. Ricky speaks of glimpsing in the bag's trajectory an ""entire life behind things""--a ""benevolent force"" that holds the universe together. The teen-ager, who likes to train his lenses on dead bodies of animals and people, sells wildly expensive marijuana to Lester and somehow passes on this notion of ""beauty."" By the end, Lester is mouthing the same sentiments and has acquired the same deadpan radiance. That must be some really good shit they're smoking. 

         It's not the druggy philosophizing, however, that makes American Beauty an emotional workout. It's that the caricatures are grounded in sympathy instead of derision. Everyone on screen is in serious pain. The manipulative sexpot Angela, who taunts her friend Jane with the idea of seducing her dad, acts chiefly out of a terror of appearing ordinary. As the military martinet, Cooper goes against the grain, turning Col. Fitts into a sour bulldog whose capaciously baggy eyes are moist with sadness over his inability to reach out. (When he stands helplessly in the rain at the end, the deluge completes him.) The character of Carolyn is so shrill as to constitute a libel on the female sex, but there isn't a second when Bening sends the woman up. She doesn't transcend the part, she fills it to the brim, anatomizes it. You can't hate Carolyn because the woman is trying so hard--to appear confident, composed, in control. When she fails to sell that house, she closes the shades and lets go with a naked wail--it's the sound of a vacuum crying to be filled--then furiously slaps herself while sputtering, ""Shut up--you're weak--shut up. "" Then she breathes, regains her go-get-'em poise, replaces her mask. Carolyn isn't a complicated dramatic construction, but Bening gives her a primal force. An actress who packs more psychological detail into a single gesture than others get into whole scenes, Bening was barreling down the road to greatness before she hit a speed bump called Warren. It's a joy to observe her--both here and in Neil Jordan's In Dreams (1999)--back at full throttle. 

                         American Beauty is Spacey's movie, though. He gives it--how weird to write this about Spacey, who made his name playing flamboyantly self-involved psychopaths--a heart. Early on, he lets his face and posture go slack and his eyes blurry. He mugs like crazy, telegraphing Lester's ""loserness."" But Spacey's genius is for mugging in character. He makes us believe that it's Lester who's caricaturing himself , and that bitter edge paves the way for the character's later, more comfortably Spacey-like scenes of insult and mockery. He even makes us take Lester's final, improbably rhapsodic moments straight. 

         But do the filmmakers take them straight? If I read it correctly, the movie is saying that American society is unjust and absurd and loveless--full of people so afraid of seeming ordinary that they lose their capacity to see. It's saying that our only hope is to cultivate a kind of stoned aesthetic detachment whereby even a man with his brains blown out becomes an object of beauty and a signpost to a Higher Power. But to scrutinize a freshly dead body and not ask how it got that way--or if there's anyone nearby with a gun who might want to add to the body count--strikes me as either moronic or insane or both. The kind of detachment the movie is peddling isn't artistic, it isn't life--it's nihilism at its most fatuous. In the end, American Beauty is New Age Nihilism. 

         Kevin Costner is 11 years older than he was as Crash Davis, the over-the-hill minor-league catcher in Bull Durham (1988), but he can still get away with playing a professional ballplayer. He moves and acts like a celebrity jock, and he can make his narcissistic self-containment look as if he's keeping something in reserve--to protect his ""instrument,"" as it were. In For Love of the Game , he's a 40ish Detroit Tigers pitcher having his last hurrah: The team has been sold and the new owners don't necessarily want him back. For about half an hour, it's a great sports movie. Costner stands on the mound shaking off the signals of his longtime catcher (John C. Reilly); he forces himself to tune out the huge Yankee Stadium crowd (the background blurs before our eyes and the sound drops out); and he mutters darkly at a succession of batters, some old nemeses, some old buddies. 

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours.

         He also thinks about his Manhattan-based ex-girlfriend (Kelly Preston), who tearfully told him that morning that things were absolutely over and she was moving to London. There's an appealing flashback to how they met (he stopped to fix her car while on the way to Yankee Stadium), then it's back to the game for more nail-biting at bats. But pretty soon the relationship flashbacks start coming thick and fast, and the balance of the movie shifts to whether Kevin can commit to Kelly and Kelly can commit to Kevin or whether his only commitment could ever be to the ball and the diamond and the game. 

         Maybe it's because I'm a baseball nut that I hated to leave the mound. But maybe it's also because the relationships scenes are soft-focus, generic, and woozily drawn-out, whereas the stuff in the stadium is sharply edited and full of texture. The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours. I can't believe that the director, Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead , 1983; last year's A Simple Plan ) thought that all those scenes of Costner and Preston staring into space while the piano plinks would end up in the final cut, but Raimi apparently gave up control of the final cut for the sake of making his first, real mainstream picture. He might as well have stuck his head over the plate and said, ""Bean me.""

         In the animated ecological epic                    Princess Mononoke                , the camera travels over landscapes with a clear, steady gaze, like a Zen hang glider. The images have none of the comin'-at-ya pop-surrealism of American cartoons, many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack-in-the-boxes. The Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself, seems to work from the outside in: to begin with the curve of the earth, then the mossy hills, the watercolor foliage, the nubby stones, the whorls on the wood, the meticulous carvings on a teacup. He captures the texture of light and the currents of air. You could almost settle down in this landscape. A view of nature that some would call ""tree-hugging"" doesn't feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail. 

         But then, ""soft"" is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke , however pantheistic its worldview. The film, which is rated PG-13, is full of splattery carnage. If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative, in close-up he's ferocious. He's both inside and outside the action: He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment. According to the New                 York Times , Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged, and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features. Watching Princess                 Mononoke --which has been dubbed to Disney/Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two-hour-plus length, its gory beheadings, and its grim, near-apocalyptic finale--you can understand their worship. It isn't that Miyazaki's work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles; it's that everything is sublimely in proportion. 

         The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood's homiletic, follow-your-dream fables look even more solipsistic. Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history (the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries) when the power shifted from a ""natural"" world to one shaped by human technology. It's the beginning of what Bill McKibben called ""the end of nature""--that is, when nature became no longer an autonomous, self-regulating force but one touched (and, in Miyazaki's view, poisoned) by human industry. 

         The hero, Ashitaka, a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan, is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar--a god turned into a demon (covered in roiling, corrosive worms) by an iron ball lodged in its body. Infected, destined to be consumed by--and to die of--rage, Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball's source. He discovers a fortress-cum-arms-manufacturing plant called Irontown, presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film: the regal Lady Eboshi. On one hand, she's a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society; on the other, she wants to destroy the forest, harness its resources, and exterminate its animal deities--chiefly the Spirit of the Forest, a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death, and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker. 

         P rincess Mononoke builds to a full-scale war between humans and the animal kingdom--which does not, by the way, consist of your father's cartoon critters. In fact, the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka's call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony; they'd like to eat him. The wolf god, Moro, is slightly more sympathetic, but that's because her adopted ""daughter,"" San (a k a Princess Mononoke), is human. San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother, then, as the gore drips from her mouth, training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred. Her second appearance--a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi--is one of the movie's high points. It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away: the determined tap of the wolf princess's shoes as she scuttles over the fortress's rooftops; the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky. Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition--it's almost subliminal. 

         It's a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him. She loses that punk-bitch allure. The voice of Claire Danes doesn't help. When Danes says, ""I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest,"" she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall. (San needs a more ragged voice--I'd be interested to hear the original Japanese actress.) Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied (Miramaxed?), but that doesn't hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ingÃ©nu. Gillian Anderson's growling Moro sounds silly (she doesn't have the breath control), and the fey-hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff-like mercenary, Jigo. But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?"" The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, would be worth seeing just for Stamp's performance, at once rock-hard and goofily blinkered, and for Peter Fonda's wittily self-parodic turn as the suspected killer, a music producer who coasts on '60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work. (""Oh, man,"" he says, the fear finally seeping through the ether. ""This is getting all too close to me."") 

         But the picture's glory is its layered and intricate syntax. The dialogue moves ahead--there are great gobs of exposition--but the images continually double back: to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, as his daughter's acting teacher, simply gazing at each other; or to Stamp sitting on a plane, remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach, the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright--almost supernatural--spot that dances over her face. The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.) The rest is only half-glimpsed, fantasized, or saturated by memory--or is the present the memory? Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup? 

         Some, including the critic at Time , have questioned Soderbergh's sanity. (But of course--Soderbergh flouts time!) I see a method to his madness. Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey-Boy , Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture. He's saying: This --not all that other stuff--is what's important. He telegraphs the ending--you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter's death--but it's still an emotional wow. The climax justifies the technique. It says the point of this odyssey isn't revenge but regret--for irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love. 

         Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learn on the job. Working within a tight genre structure, he's discovering hundreds of ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel. Is he totally successful? No; he misses now and then, which is why the technique sticks out. But what a fantastic effort. See it and weep for what's missing in most other movies.

The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?"" The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, would be worth seeing just for Stamp's performance, at once rock-hard and goofily blinkered, and for Peter Fonda's wittily self-parodic turn as the suspected killer, a music producer who coasts on '60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work. (""Oh, man,"" he says, the fear finally seeping through the ether. ""This is getting all too close to me."") 

         But the picture's glory is its layered and intricate syntax. The dialogue moves ahead--there are great gobs of exposition--but the images continually double back: to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, as his daughter's acting teacher, simply gazing at each other; or to Stamp sitting on a plane, remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach, the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright--almost supernatural--spot that dances over her face. The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.) The rest is only half-glimpsed, fantasized, or saturated by memory--or is the present the memory? Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup? 

         Some, including the critic at Time , have questioned Soderbergh's sanity. (But of course--Soderbergh flouts time!) I see a method to his madness. Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey-Boy , Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture. He's saying: This --not all that other stuff--is what's important. He telegraphs the ending--you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter's death--but it's still an emotional wow. The climax justifies the technique. It says the point of this odyssey isn't revenge but regret--for irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love. 

         Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learn on the job. Working within a tight genre structure, he's discovering hundreds of ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel. Is he totally successful? No; he misses now and then, which is why the technique sticks out. But what a fantastic effort. See it and weep for what's missing in most other movies.

         In the animated ecological epic                    Princess Mononoke                , the camera travels over landscapes with a clear, steady gaze, like a Zen hang glider. The images have none of the comin'-at-ya pop-surrealism of American cartoons, many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack-in-the-boxes. The Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself, seems to work from the outside in: to begin with the curve of the earth, then the mossy hills, the watercolor foliage, the nubby stones, the whorls on the wood, the meticulous carvings on a teacup. He captures the texture of light and the currents of air. You could almost settle down in this landscape. A view of nature that some would call ""tree-hugging"" doesn't feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail. 

         But then, ""soft"" is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke , however pantheistic its worldview. The film, which is rated PG-13, is full of splattery carnage. If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative, in close-up he's ferocious. He's both inside and outside the action: He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment. According to the New                 York Times , Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged, and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features. Watching Princess                 Mononoke --which has been dubbed to Disney/Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two-hour-plus length, its gory beheadings, and its grim, near-apocalyptic finale--you can understand their worship. It isn't that Miyazaki's work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles; it's that everything is sublimely in proportion. 

         The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood's homiletic, follow-your-dream fables look even more solipsistic. Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history (the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries) when the power shifted from a ""natural"" world to one shaped by human technology. It's the beginning of what Bill McKibben called ""the end of nature""--that is, when nature became no longer an autonomous, self-regulating force but one touched (and, in Miyazaki's view, poisoned) by human industry. 

         The hero, Ashitaka, a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan, is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar--a god turned into a demon (covered in roiling, corrosive worms) by an iron ball lodged in its body. Infected, destined to be consumed by--and to die of--rage, Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball's source. He discovers a fortress-cum-arms-manufacturing plant called Irontown, presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film: the regal Lady Eboshi. On one hand, she's a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society; on the other, she wants to destroy the forest, harness its resources, and exterminate its animal deities--chiefly the Spirit of the Forest, a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death, and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker. 

         P rincess Mononoke builds to a full-scale war between humans and the animal kingdom--which does not, by the way, consist of your father's cartoon critters. In fact, the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka's call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony; they'd like to eat him. The wolf god, Moro, is slightly more sympathetic, but that's because her adopted ""daughter,"" San (a k a Princess Mononoke), is human. San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother, then, as the gore drips from her mouth, training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred. Her second appearance--a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi--is one of the movie's high points. It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away: the determined tap of the wolf princess's shoes as she scuttles over the fortress's rooftops; the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky. Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition--it's almost subliminal. 

         It's a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him. She loses that punk-bitch allure. The voice of Claire Danes doesn't help. When Danes says, ""I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest,"" she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall. (San needs a more ragged voice--I'd be interested to hear the original Japanese actress.) Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied (Miramaxed?), but that doesn't hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ingÃ©nu. Gillian Anderson's growling Moro sounds silly (she doesn't have the breath control), and the fey-hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff-like mercenary, Jigo. But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why.

43,"Boys Do Bleed 

         Fight Club is silly stuff, sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire, but it's also a brash and transporting piece of moviemaking, like Raging Bull on acid. The film opens with--literally--a surge of adrenalin, which travels through the bloodstream and into the brain of its protagonist, Jack (Edward Norton), who's viewed, as the camera pulls out of his insides, with a gun stuck in his mouth. How'd he get into this pickle? He's going to tell you, breezily, and the director, David Fincher, is going to illustrate his narrative--violently. Fincher ( Seven , 1995; The Game , 1997) is out to bombard you with so much feverish imagery that you have no choice but to succumb to the movie's reeling, punch-drunk worldview. By the end, you might feel as if you, too, have a mouthful of blood. 

         Not to mention a hole in your head. Fight Club careers from one resonant satirical idea to the next without quite deciding whether its characters are full of crap or are Gen X prophets. It always gives you a rush, though. At first, it goofs on the absurd feminization of an absurdly macho culture. An increasingly desperate insomniac, Jack finds relief (and release) only at meetings for the terminally ill. At a testicular cancer group, he's enfolded in the ample arms of Bob (the singer Meat Loaf Aday), a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now has ""bitch tits."" Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding: They cling to each other and sob. But Jack's idyll is rudely disrupted by--wouldn't you know it?--a woman. A dark-eyed, sepulchral head case named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings for essentially the same voyeuristic ends, and the presence of this ""tourist"" makes it impossible for Jack to emote. 

         Jack finds another outlet, though. On a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cryptic hipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large (he makes high-priced soaps from liposuctioned human fat) and small (he splices frames from porn flicks into kiddie movies). When Jack's apartment mysteriously explodes--along with his carefully chosen IKEA furniture--he moves into Tyler's squalid warehouse and helps to found a new religion: Fight Club, in which young males gather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another (and be pounded) to a bloody pulp. That last parenthesis isn't so parenthetical. In some ways, it's the longing to be beaten into oblivion that's the strongest. ""Self-improvement,"" explains Tyler, ""is masturbation""; self-destruction is the new way. Tyler's manifesto calls for an end to consumerism (""Things you own end up owning you""), and since society is going down (""Martha Stewart is polishing brass on the Titanic ""), the only creative outlet left is annihilation. ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,"" he says. 

         Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, seem to think they've broken new ground in Fight                 Club , that their metaphor for our discontents hits harder than anyone else's. Certainly it produces more bloody splatter. But 20 years ago, the same impulse was called punk and, as Greil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces , it was other things before that. Yes, the mixture of Johnny Rotten, Jake La Motta, and Jesus is unique; and the Faludi-esque emasculation themes are more explicit. But there's something deeply movie-ish about the whole conceit, as if the novelist and director were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming of recapturing that first masochistic rush. 

         The novel, the first by Chuck Palahniuk (the surname sounds like Eskimo for ""palooka""--which somehow fits), walks a line between the straight and ironic--it isn't always clear if its glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as the ravings of a delusional mama's boy. But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the assembled fighters that they are the ""middle children of history"" with ""no purpose and no place""--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis (a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel. ""We are a generation of men raised by women,"" Tyler announces, and adds, ""If our fathers bail, what does that tell you about God?"" (I give up: What?) 

         F ight                 Club could use a few different perspectives: a woman's, obviously, but also an African-American's--someone who'd have a different take on the ""healing"" properties of violence. It's also unclear just what has emasculated Jack: Is it that he's a materialist or that the materials themselves (i.e., IKEA's lacquered particle boards) don't measure up to his fantasies of opulence? Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envy? Tyler's subsequent idea of confining his group's mayhem to franchise coffee bars and corporate-subsidized art is a witty one--it's like a parody of neo-Nazism as re-enacted by yuppies. It might have been a howl if performed by, say, the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski (1998). Somehow Brad Pitt doesn't have the same piquancy. 

         Actually, Pitt isn't as terrible as usual: He's playing not a character but a conceit, and he can bask in his movie-idol arrogance, which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has. But the film belongs to Norton. As a ferocious skinhead in last year's American History X , Norton was taut and ropy, his long torso curled into a sneer; here, he's skinny and wilting, a quivering pansy. Even when he fights he doesn't transform--he's a raging wimp. The performance is marvelous, and it makes poetic sense in light of the movie's climactic twist. But that twist will annoy more people than it will delight, if only because it shifts the drama from the realm of the sociological to that of the psychoanalytic. The finale, scored with the Pixies' great ""Where Is My Mind?"" comes off facetiously--as if Fincher is throwing the movie away. 

         Until then, however, he has done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning. The most thrilling thing about Fight Club isn't what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into its narrator's head and simulate his adrenalin rushes. A veteran of rock videos, Fincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTV--along with digital editing--has transformed cinema for better as well as worse. The syntax has become more intricate. Voice-over narration, once considered uncinematic, is back in style, along with novelistic asides, digressions, fantasies, and flashbacks. To make a point, you can jazzily interject anything--even, as in Three Kings , a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs. Films like Fight Club might not gel, but they have a breathless, free-associational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling. Or maybe old possibilities: The language of movies hasn't seemed this unfettered since the pre-sound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance. 

         An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the most rapturous performances I've ever seen as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena (a k a Teena Brandon) in Kimberly Peirce's stark and astonishingly beautiful debut feature,                    Boys Don't Cry                . The movie opens with Teena being shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming ""Brandon,"" who swaggers around in tight jeans and leather jackets. The joy is in watching the actor transform, and I don't just mean Swank: I mean Teena Brandon playing Brandon Teena--the role she has been longing for her whole life. In a redneck Nebraska bar, Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesture--a macho cliché--becomes an act of self-discovery. Every gesture does. ""You're gonna have a shiner in the morning,"" someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl, and he takes the news with a glee that's almost mystical: ""I am????? Oh, shit!!!"" he cries, grinning. That might be my favorite moment in the picture, because Swank's ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour, as Brandon acts out his urban-cowboy fantasies--""surfing"" from the bumper of a pickup truck, rolling in the mud, and straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski and the other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe. 

         That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and into something more complex and irreducible: a meditation on the irrelevance of gender. Peirce's triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberant (occasionally hilarious) and foreboding, so that all the seeds of Brandon's killing are right there on the screen. John (Peter Sarsgaard), one of his future rapists and murderers, calls him ""little buddy"" and seems almost attracted to him; Sarsgaard's performance is a finely chiseled study of how unresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence. 

         Though harrowing, the second half of Boys Don't Cry isn't as great as the first. The early scenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously, the later ones just dread; and the last half-hour is unrelieved torture. What keeps the movie tantalizing is Chloë Sevigny's Lana, who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl but who's entranced by him anyway. With her lank hair, hooded eyes, and air of sleepy sensuality, Sevigny--maybe even more than Swank--embodies the mystery of sex that's at the core of Boys Don't Cry . Everything she does is deliberate, ironic, slightly unreadable--and unyielding. She's could be saying, ""I'm in this world but not of it. ... You'd never dream what's underneath."" 

         I n                 brief: If a friend tells you you'll love                    Happy Texas                , rethink the friendship. This clunky mistaken-identity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageant directors doesn't even make sense on its own low farcical terms; it's mostly one lame homo joke after another. The only bright spot is Steve Zahn, who could be the offspring of Michael J. Fox and Crispin Glover if they'd mated on the set of Back to the Future (1985). 

         It's hard to make a serious case for Lawrence Kasdan's                    Mumford                , which has apparently flopped but which you can still catch at second- and third-tier theaters. It looks peculiar--a Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows. And its tale of a small town healed by a depressive (Loren Dean) posing as a psychologist is full of doddering misconceptions about psychotherapy. I almost don't know why I loved it, but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short, Ted Danson, David Paymer, and Mary McDonnell surely helped. I can't decide if the weirdly affectless Dean is inspired or inept, but my indecision suggests why he works in the role. There's no doubt, however, about his even more depressive love object, Hope Davis, who posseses the cinema's most expressive honking-nasal voice and who slumps through the movie like the world's most lyrical anti-ballerina. Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent: They made me think of Mumford as the home of the psychological mumps.

Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.


 ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,
 but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to
 answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very
 complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.


 Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.


 Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.


 ""Atom bomb.""


 A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. ""Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I
 thought you said an 'atom bomb.'""


 ""Did,"" Funston murmured.


 Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so
 slightly. ""Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative
 thought. I'm very pleased.""


 She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.


 A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood
 up and stretched.


 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your
 things.""


 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit
 of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he
 clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and
 then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk
 back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a
 quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the
 warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.


 Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart
 book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she
 made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each
 patient.


 At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball
 and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through
 the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted
 lengthily in her chart book.


 When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked
 the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.


 The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile
 to the main administration building where her car was parked.


 As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the
 barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills
 towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant
 came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'
 mess hall.
The sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the
 ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light
 burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm
 hills.


 At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat
 up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and
 occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.
 Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that
 sheltered the deserted crafts building.


 He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark
 shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.


 An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck
 the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a
 thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild
 screams of the frightened and demented patients.


 It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling
 lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.


 Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a
 small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been
 the arts and crafts building.


 Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed
 with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried
 through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the
 explosion.


 None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a
 welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.


 The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the
 surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units
 from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the
 still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.


 Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy
 radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and
 equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.


 At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of
 Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI
 agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.


 At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast
 crater.


 In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.


 ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the
 fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of
 experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.
 ""How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?""


 ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC
 men offered timidly. ""Not over three kilotons.""


 ""I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,"" Thurgood screamed. ""How
 did it get here?""


 A military intelligence agent spoke up. ""If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be
 standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an
 atomic explosion.""


 Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.


 ""Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything
 that was in that building?"" Thurgood swept his hand in the general
 direction of the blast crater.


 ""Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,"" the hospital administrator said
 with exasperation, ""this was our manual therapy room. We gave our
 patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,
 through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems
 that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints
 and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then
 Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.""


 ""All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,""
 Thurgood sighed. ""I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this
 morning blew it to hell and gone.


 ""And I've got to find out how it happened.""


 Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little
 doctor.


 ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?""


 ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here
 now,"" the doctor snapped.
Outside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved
 around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining
 every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one
 time.


 A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the
 tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.


 She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned
 expression.


 ""He did make an atom bomb,"" she cried.


 Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped
 forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.


 At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff
 room of the hospital administration building.


 Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the
 edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist
 on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with
 every beat.


 ""It's ridiculous,"" Thurgood roared. ""We'll all be the laughingstocks of
 the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You
 are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.""


 At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the
 broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,
 strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered
 weariness.


 ""Miss Abercrombie,"" one of the physicists spoke up gently, ""you say that
 after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at
 Funston's work?""


 The therapist nodded unhappily.


 ""And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,"" the physicist
 continued, ""there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.""


 ""I'm positive that's all there was in it,"" Miss Abercrombie cried.


 There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC
 man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They
 conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.


 ""That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston
 another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.""


 Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.


 ""Are you crazy?"" he screamed. ""You want to get us all thrown into this
 filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they
 ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,
 anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with
 the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?


 ""They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!""


 At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's
 greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an
 officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small
 side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes
 later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and
 drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of
 the runway with propellers turning.


 Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to
 secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard
 the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss
 Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into
 the night skies.


 The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in
 the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack
 miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and
 military men huddled around a small wooden table.


 There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of
 modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off
 Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary
 Miss Abercrombie.


 ""Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same
 kind of clay he used before?""


 ""I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the
 hospital,"" she replied, ""and it's the same amount.""


 Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with
 Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.


 She smiled at Funston.


 ""Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,"" she said. ""These nice men have
 brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the
 one you made for me yesterday.""


 A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the
 shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he
 walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp
 clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top
 atomic scientists watched in fascination.


 His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay
 parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in
 front of him.


 Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the
 table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she
 glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston
 finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense
 silence.


 ""Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow."" She
 looked at the men and nodded her head.


 The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of
 clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him
 from the shack.


 There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The
 experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere
 and cameras clicking.


 For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay
 and photographed it from every angle.


 Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down
 range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of
 stony-faced military policemen.


 ""I told you this whole thing was asinine,"" Thurgood snarled as the
 scientific teams trooped into the bunker.


 Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open
 door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden
 cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit
 the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door
 slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.
Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space
 on a tail of flame.

A FILBERT IS A NUT
BY RICK RAPHAEL
That the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized
 psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!
Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.

 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your

 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit

A FILBERT IS A NUT
BY RICK RAPHAEL
That the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized
 psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!
Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.


 ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,
 but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to
 answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very
 complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.


 Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.


 Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.


 ""Atom bomb.""


 A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. ""Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I
 thought you said an 'atom bomb.'""


 ""Did,"" Funston murmured.


 Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so
 slightly. ""Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative
 thought. I'm very pleased.""


 She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.


 A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood
 up and stretched.


 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your
 things.""


 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit
 of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he
 clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and
 then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk
 back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a
 quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the
 warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.


 Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart
 book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she
 made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each
 patient.


 At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball
 and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through
 the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted
 lengthily in her chart book.


 When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked
 the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.


 The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile
 to the main administration building where her car was parked.


 As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the
 barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills
 towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant
 came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'
 mess hall.
The sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the
 ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light
 burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm
 hills.


 At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat
 up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and
 occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.
 Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that
 sheltered the deserted crafts building.


 He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark
 shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.


 An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck
 the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a
 thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild
 screams of the frightened and demented patients.


 It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling
 lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.


 Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a
 small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been
 the arts and crafts building.


 Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed
 with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried
 through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the
 explosion.


 None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a
 welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.


 The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the
 surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units
 from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the
 still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.


 Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy
 radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and
 equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.


 At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of
 Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI
 agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.


 At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast
 crater.


 In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.


 ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the
 fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of
 experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.
 ""How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?""


 ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC
 men offered timidly. ""Not over three kilotons.""


 ""I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,"" Thurgood screamed. ""How
 did it get here?""


 A military intelligence agent spoke up. ""If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be
 standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an
 atomic explosion.""


 Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.


 ""Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything
 that was in that building?"" Thurgood swept his hand in the general
 direction of the blast crater.


 ""Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,"" the hospital administrator said
 with exasperation, ""this was our manual therapy room. We gave our
 patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,
 through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems
 that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints
 and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then
 Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.""


 ""All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,""
 Thurgood sighed. ""I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this
 morning blew it to hell and gone.


 ""And I've got to find out how it happened.""


 Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little
 doctor.


 ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?""


 ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here
 now,"" the doctor snapped.
Outside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved
 around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining
 every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one
 time.


 A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the
 tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.


 She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned
 expression.


 ""He did make an atom bomb,"" she cried.


 Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped
 forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.


 At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff
 room of the hospital administration building.


 Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the
 edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist
 on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with
 every beat.


 ""It's ridiculous,"" Thurgood roared. ""We'll all be the laughingstocks of
 the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You
 are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.""


 At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the
 broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,
 strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered
 weariness.


 ""Miss Abercrombie,"" one of the physicists spoke up gently, ""you say that
 after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at
 Funston's work?""


 The therapist nodded unhappily.


 ""And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,"" the physicist
 continued, ""there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.""


 ""I'm positive that's all there was in it,"" Miss Abercrombie cried.


 There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC
 man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They
 conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.


 ""That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston
 another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.""


 Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.


 ""Are you crazy?"" he screamed. ""You want to get us all thrown into this
 filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they
 ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,
 anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with
 the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?


 ""They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!""


 At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's
 greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an
 officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small
 side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes
 later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and
 drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of
 the runway with propellers turning.


 Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to
 secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard
 the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss
 Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into
 the night skies.


 The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in
 the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack
 miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and
 military men huddled around a small wooden table.


 There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of
 modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off
 Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary
 Miss Abercrombie.


 ""Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same
 kind of clay he used before?""


 ""I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the
 hospital,"" she replied, ""and it's the same amount.""


 Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with
 Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.


 She smiled at Funston.


 ""Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,"" she said. ""These nice men have
 brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the
 one you made for me yesterday.""


 A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the
 shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he
 walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp
 clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top
 atomic scientists watched in fascination.


 His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay
 parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in
 front of him.


 Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the
 table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she
 glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston
 finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense
 silence.


 ""Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow."" She
 looked at the men and nodded her head.


 The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of
 clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him
 from the shack.


 There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The
 experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere
 and cameras clicking.


 For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay
 and photographed it from every angle.


 Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down
 range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of
 stony-faced military policemen.


 ""I told you this whole thing was asinine,"" Thurgood snarled as the
 scientific teams trooped into the bunker.


 Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open
 door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden
 cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit
 the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door
 slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.
Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space
 on a tail of flame.

Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space
 on a tail of flame.

A FILBERT IS A NUT
BY RICK RAPHAEL
That the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized
 psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!
Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.


 ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,
 but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to
 answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very
 complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.


 Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.


 Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.


 ""Atom bomb.""


 A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. ""Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I
 thought you said an 'atom bomb.'""


 ""Did,"" Funston murmured.


 Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so
 slightly. ""Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative
 thought. I'm very pleased.""


 She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.


 A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood
 up and stretched.


 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your
 things.""


 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit
 of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he
 clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and
 then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk
 back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a
 quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the
 warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.


 Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart
 book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she
 made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each
 patient.


 At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball
 and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through
 the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted
 lengthily in her chart book.


 When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked
 the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.


 The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile
 to the main administration building where her car was parked.


 As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the
 barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills
 towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant
 came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'
 mess hall.
The sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the
 ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light
 burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm
 hills.


 At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat
 up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and
 occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.
 Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that
 sheltered the deserted crafts building.


 He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark
 shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.


 An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck
 the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a
 thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild
 screams of the frightened and demented patients.


 It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling
 lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.


 Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a
 small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been
 the arts and crafts building.


 Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed
 with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried
 through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the
 explosion.


 None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a
 welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.


 The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the
 surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units
 from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the
 still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.


 Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy
 radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and
 equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.


 At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of
 Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI
 agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.


 At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast
 crater.


 In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.


 ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the
 fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of
 experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.
 ""How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?""


 ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC
 men offered timidly. ""Not over three kilotons.""


 ""I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,"" Thurgood screamed. ""How
 did it get here?""


 A military intelligence agent spoke up. ""If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be
 standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an
 atomic explosion.""


 Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.


 ""Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything
 that was in that building?"" Thurgood swept his hand in the general
 direction of the blast crater.


 ""Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,"" the hospital administrator said
 with exasperation, ""this was our manual therapy room. We gave our
 patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,
 through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems
 that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints
 and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then
 Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.""


 ""All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,""
 Thurgood sighed. ""I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this
 morning blew it to hell and gone.


 ""And I've got to find out how it happened.""


 Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little
 doctor.


 ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?""


 ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here
 now,"" the doctor snapped.
Outside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved
 around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining
 every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one
 time.


 A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the
 tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.


 She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned
 expression.


 ""He did make an atom bomb,"" she cried.


 Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped
 forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.


 At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff
 room of the hospital administration building.


 Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the
 edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist
 on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with
 every beat.


 ""It's ridiculous,"" Thurgood roared. ""We'll all be the laughingstocks of
 the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You
 are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.""


 At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the
 broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,
 strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered
 weariness.


 ""Miss Abercrombie,"" one of the physicists spoke up gently, ""you say that
 after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at
 Funston's work?""


 The therapist nodded unhappily.


 ""And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,"" the physicist
 continued, ""there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.""


 ""I'm positive that's all there was in it,"" Miss Abercrombie cried.


 There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC
 man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They
 conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.


 ""That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston
 another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.""


 Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.


 ""Are you crazy?"" he screamed. ""You want to get us all thrown into this
 filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they
 ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,
 anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with
 the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?


 ""They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!""


 At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's
 greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an
 officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small
 side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes
 later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and
 drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of
 the runway with propellers turning.


 Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to
 secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard
 the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss
 Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into
 the night skies.


 The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in
 the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack
 miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and
 military men huddled around a small wooden table.


 There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of
 modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off
 Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary
 Miss Abercrombie.


 ""Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same
 kind of clay he used before?""


 ""I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the
 hospital,"" she replied, ""and it's the same amount.""


 Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with
 Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.


 She smiled at Funston.


 ""Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,"" she said. ""These nice men have
 brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the
 one you made for me yesterday.""


 A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the
 shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he
 walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp
 clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top
 atomic scientists watched in fascination.


 His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay
 parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in
 front of him.


 Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the
 table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she
 glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston
 finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense
 silence.


 ""Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow."" She
 looked at the men and nodded her head.


 The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of
 clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him
 from the shack.


 There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The
 experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere
 and cameras clicking.


 For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay
 and photographed it from every angle.


 Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down
 range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of
 stony-faced military policemen.


 ""I told you this whole thing was asinine,"" Thurgood snarled as the
 scientific teams trooped into the bunker.


 Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open
 door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden
 cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit
 the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door
 slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.
Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space
 on a tail of flame.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting
 what she wanted.
Phil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his
 long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious
 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting

 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

46,"SECOND LANDING
By FLOYD WALLACE
A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season—an
 oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something
 that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer.
Earth
 was so far away that
 it wasn't visible. Even the
 sun was only a twinkle. But this
 vast distance did not mean that
 isolation could endure forever.
 Instruments within the ship intercepted
 radio broadcasts and,
 within the hour, early TV signals.
 Machines compiled dictionaries
 and grammars and began
 translating the major languages.
 The history of the planet was
 tabulated as facts became available.


 The course of the ship changed
 slightly; it was not much out of
 the way to swing nearer Earth.
 For days the two within the ship
 listened and watched with little
 comment. They had to decide
 soon.


 ""We've got to make or break,""
 said the first alien.


 ""You know what I'm in favor
 of,"" said the second.


 ""I can guess,"" said Ethaniel,
 who had spoken first. ""The place
 is a complete mess. They've never
 done anything except fight
 each other—and invent better
 weapons.""


 ""It's not what they've done,""
 said Bal, the second alien. ""It's
 what they're going to do, with
 that big bomb.""


 ""The more reason for stopping,""
 said Ethaniel. ""The big
 bomb can destroy them. Without
 our help they may do just that.""


 ""I may remind you that in two
 months twenty-nine days we're
 due in Willafours,"" said Bal.
 ""Without looking at the charts
 I can tell you we still have more
 than a hundred light-years to
 go.""


 ""A week,"" said Ethaniel. ""We
 can spare a week and still get
 there on time.""


 ""A week?"" said Bal. ""To settle
 their problems? They've had two
 world wars in one generation
 and that the third and final one
 is coming up you can't help feeling
 in everything they do.""


 ""It won't take much,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""The wrong diplomatic
 move, or a trigger-happy soldier
 could set it off. And it wouldn't
 have to be deliberate. A meteor
 shower could pass over and their
 clumsy instruments could interpret
 it as an all-out enemy
 attack.""


 ""Too bad,"" said Bal. ""We'll
 just have to forget there ever
 was such a planet as Earth.""


 ""Could you? Forget so many
 people?""


 ""I'm doing it,"" said Bal. ""Just
 give them a little time and they
 won't be here to remind me that
 I have a conscience.""


 ""My memory isn't convenient,""
 said Ethaniel. ""I ask you
 to look at them.""
Bal rustled, flicking the screen
 intently. ""Very much like ourselves,""
 he said at last. ""A bit
 shorter perhaps, and most certainly
 incomplete. Except for the
 one thing they lack, and that's
 quite odd, they seem exactly like
 us. Is that what you wanted me
 to say?""


 ""It is. The fact that they are
 an incomplete version of ourselves
 touches me. They actually
 seem defenseless, though I suppose
 they're not.""


 ""Tough,"" said Bal. ""Nothing
 we can do about it.""


 ""There is. We can give them
 a week.""


 ""In a week we can't negate
 their entire history. We can't
 begin to undo the effect of the
 big bomb.""


 ""You can't tell,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""We can look things over.""


 ""And then what? How much
 authority do we have?""


 ""Very little,"" conceded Ethaniel.
 ""Two minor officials on the
 way to Willafours—and we run
 directly into a problem no one
 knew existed.""


 ""And when we get to Willafours
 we'll be busy. It will be a
 long time before anyone comes
 this way again.""


 ""A very long time. There's
 nothing in this region of space
 our people want,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""And how long can Earth last?
 Ten years? Even ten months?
 The tension is building by the
 hour.""


 ""What can I say?"" said Bal.
 ""I suppose we can stop and look
 them over. We're not committing
 ourselves by looking.""


 They went much closer to
 Earth, not intending to commit
 themselves. For a day they circled
 the planet, avoiding radar
 detection, which for them was
 not difficult, testing, and sampling.
 Finally Ethaniel looked up
 from the monitor screen. ""Any
 conclusions?""


 ""What's there to think? It's
 worse than I imagined.""


 ""In what way?""


 ""Well, we knew they had the
 big bomb. Atmospheric analysis
 showed that as far away as we
 were.""


 ""I know.""


 ""We also knew they could deliver
 the big bomb, presumably
 by some sort of aircraft.""


 ""That was almost a certainty.
 They'd have no use for the big
 bomb without aircraft.""


 ""What's worse is that I now
 find they also have missiles,
 range one thousand miles and
 upward. They either have or are
 near a primitive form of space
 travel.""


 ""Bad,"" said Ethaniel. ""Sitting
 there, wondering when it's going
 to hit them. Nervousness could
 set it off.""


 ""It could, and the missiles
 make it worse,"" said Bal. ""What
 did you find out at your end?""


 ""Nothing worthwhile. I was
 looking at the people while you
 were investigating their weapons.""


 ""You must think something.""


 ""I wish I knew what to think.
 There's so little time,"" Ethaniel
 said. ""Language isn't the difficulty.
 Our machines translate
 their languages easily and I've
 taken a cram course in two or
 three of them. But that's not
 enough, looking at a few plays,
 listening to advertisements, music,
 and news bulletins. I should
 go down and live among them,
 read books, talk to scholars, work
 with them, play.""


 ""You could do that and you'd
 really get to know them. But
 that takes time—and we don't
 have it.""


 ""I realize that.""


 ""A flat yes or no,"" said Bal.


 ""No. We can't help them,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""There is nothing we
 can do for them—but we have to
 try.""


 ""Sure, I knew it before we
 started,"" said Bal. ""It's happened
 before. We take the trouble to
 find out what a people are like
 and when we can't help them we
 feel bad. It's going to be that
 way again."" He rose and stretched.
 ""Well, give me an hour to
 think of some way of going at
 it.""
It was longer than that before
 they met again. In the meantime
 the ship moved much closer to
 Earth. They no longer needed instruments
 to see it. The planet
 revolved outside the visionports.
 The southern plains were green,
 coursed with rivers; the oceans
 were blue; and much of the
 northern hemisphere was glistening
 white. Ragged clouds covered
 the pole, and a dirty pall
 spread over the mid-regions of
 the north.


 ""I haven't thought of anything
 brilliant,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""Nor I,"" said Bal. ""We're going
 to have to go down there
 cold. And it will be cold.""


 ""Yes. It's their winter.""


 ""I did have an idea,"" said Bal.
 ""What about going down as supernatural
 beings?""


 ""Hardly,"" said Ethaniel. ""A
 hundred years ago it might have
 worked. Today they have satellites.
 They are not primitives.""


 ""I suppose you're right,"" said
 Bal. ""I did think we ought to
 take advantage of our physical
 differences.""


 ""If we could I'd be all for it.
 But these people are rough and
 desperate. They wouldn't be
 fooled by anything that crude.""


 ""Well, you're calling it,"" said
 Bal.


 ""All right,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""You take one side and I the
 other. We'll tell them bluntly
 what they'll have to do if they're
 going to survive, how they can
 keep their planet in one piece so
 they can live on it.""


 ""That'll go over big. Advice is
 always popular.""


 ""Can't help it. That's all we
 have time for.""


 ""Special instructions?""


 ""None. We leave the ship here
 and go down in separate landing
 craft. You can talk with me any
 time you want to through our
 communications, but don't unless
 you have to.""


 ""They can't intercept the
 beams we use.""


 ""They can't, and even if they
 did they wouldn't know what to
 do with our language. I want
 them to think that we don't
need
to talk things over.""


 ""I get it. Makes us seem better
 than we are. They think we know
 exactly what we're doing even
 though we don't.""


 ""If we're lucky they'll think
 that.""
Bal looked out of the port at
 the planet below. ""It's going to
 be cold where I'm going. You too.
 Sure we don't want to change
 our plans and land in the southern
 hemisphere? It's summer
 there.""


 ""I'm afraid not. The great
 powers are in the north. They
 are the ones we have to reach to
 do the job.""


 ""Yeah, but I was thinking of
 that holiday you mentioned.
 We'll be running straight into it.
 That won't help us any.""


 ""I know, they don't like their
 holidays interrupted. It can't be
 helped. We can't wait until it's
 over.""


 ""I'm aware of that,"" said Bal.
 ""Fill me in on that holiday, anything
 I ought to know. Probably
 religious in origin. That so?""


 ""It was religious a long time
 ago,"" said Ethaniel. ""I didn't
 learn anything exact from radio
 and TV. Now it seems to be
 chiefly a time for eating, office
 parties, and selling merchandise.""


 ""I see. It has become a business
 holiday.""


 ""That's a good description. I
 didn't get as much of it as I
 ought to have. I was busy studying
 the people, and they're hard
 to pin down.""


 ""I see. I was thinking there
 might be some way we could tie
 ourselves in with this holiday.
 Make it work for us.""


 ""If there is I haven't thought
 of it.""


 ""You ought to know. You're
 running this one."" Bal looked
 down at the planet. Clouds were
 beginning to form at the twilight
 edge. ""I hate to go down
 and leave the ship up here with
 no one in it.""


 ""They can't touch it. No matter
 how they develop in the next
 hundred years they still won't be
 able to get in or damage it in
 any way.""


 ""It's myself I'm thinking
 about. Down there, alone.""


 ""I'll be with you. On the other
 side of the Earth.""


 ""That's not very close. I'd like
 it better if there were someone
 in the ship to bring it down in a
 hurry if things get rough. They
 don't think much of each other.
 I don't imagine they'll like aliens
 any better.""


 ""They may be unfriendly,""
 Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he
 switched a monitor screen until
 he looked at the slope of a mountain.
 It was snowing and men
 were cutting small green trees in
 the snow. ""I've thought of a
 trick.""


 ""If it saves my neck I'm for
 it.""


 ""I don't guarantee anything,""
 said Ethaniel. ""This is what I
 was thinking of: instead of hiding
 the ship against the sun
 where there's little chance it will
 be seen, we'll make sure that
 they do see it. Let's take it
 around to the night side of the
 planet and light it up.""


 ""Say, pretty good,"" said Bal.


 ""They can't imagine that we'd
 light up an unmanned ship,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""Even if the thought
 should occur to them they'll have
 no way of checking it. Also, they
 won't be eager to harm us with
 our ship shining down on them.""


 ""That's thinking,"" said Bal,
 moving to the controls. ""I'll move
 the ship over where they can see
 it best and then I'll light it up.
 I'll really light it up.""


 ""Don't spare power.""


 ""Don't worry about that.
 They'll see it. Everybody on
 Earth will see it."" Later, with the
 ship in position, glowing against
 the darkness of space, pulsating
 with light, Bal said: ""You know,
 I feel better about this. We may
 pull it off. Lighting the ship may
 be just the help we need.""


 ""It's not we who need help, but
 the people of Earth,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""See you in five days."" With
 that he entered a small landing
 craft, which left a faintly luminescent
 trail as it plunged toward
 Earth. As soon as it was
 safe to do so, Bal left in another
 craft, heading for the other side
 of the planet.
And the spaceship circled
 Earth, unmanned, blazing and
 pulsing with light. No star in the
 winter skies of the planet below
 could equal it in brilliancy. Once
 a man-made satellite came near
 but it was dim and was lost sight
 of by the people below. During
 the day the ship was visible as
 a bright spot of light. At evening
 it seemed to burn through
 the sunset colors.


 And the ship circled on,
 bright, shining, seeming to be a
 little piece clipped from the center
 of a star and brought near
 Earth to illuminate it. Never, or
 seldom, had Earth seen anything
 like it.


 In five days the two small landing
 craft that had left it arched
 up from Earth and joined the
 orbit of the large ship. The two
 small craft slid inside the large
 one and doors closed behind
 them. In a short time the aliens
 met again.


 ""We did it,"" said Bal exultantly
 as he came in. ""I don't know
 how we did it and I thought we
 were going to fail but at the last
 minute they came through.""


 Ethaniel smiled. ""I'm tired,""
 he said, rustling.


 ""Me too, but mostly I'm cold,""
 said Bal, shivering. ""Snow.
 Nothing but snow wherever I
 went. Miserable climate. And yet
 you had me go out walking after
 that first day.""


 ""From my own experience it
 seemed to be a good idea,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""If I went out walking
 one day I noticed that the next
 day the officials were much more
 cooperative. If it worked for me
 I thought it might help you.""


 ""It did. I don't know why, but
 it did,"" said Bal. ""Anyway, this
 agreement they made isn't the
 best but I think it will keep them
 from destroying themselves.""


 ""It's as much as we can expect,""
 said Ethaniel. ""They may
 have small wars after this, but
 never the big one. In fifty or a
 hundred years we can come back
 and see how much they've
 learned.""


 ""I'm not sure I want to,"" said
 Bal. ""Say, what's an angel?""


 ""Why?""


 ""When I went out walking
 people stopped to look. Some
 knelt in the snow and called me
 an angel.""


 ""Something like that happened
 to me,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""I didn't get it but I didn't let
 it upset me,"" said Bal. ""I smiled
 at them and went about my business.""
 He shivered again. ""It was
 always cold. I walked out, but
 sometimes I flew back. I hope
 that was all right.""


 In the cabin Bal spread his
 great wings. Renaissance painters
 had never seen his like but
 knew exactly how he looked. In
 their paintings they had pictured
 him innumerable times.


 ""I don't think it hurt us that
 you flew,"" said Ethaniel. ""I did
 so myself occasionally.""


 ""But you don't know what an
 angel is?""


 ""No. I didn't have time to find
 out. Some creature of their folklore
 I suppose. You know, except
 for our wings they're very much
 like ourselves. Their legends are
 bound to resemble ours.""


 ""Sure,"" said Bal. ""Anyway,
 peace on Earth.""

 ""I did have an idea,"" said Bal.
 ""What about going down as supernatural
 beings?""


 ""Hardly,"" said Ethaniel. ""A
 hundred years ago it might have
 worked. Today they have satellites.
 They are not primitives.""


 ""I suppose you're right,"" said
 Bal. ""I did think we ought to
 take advantage of our physical
 differences.""


 ""If we could I'd be all for it.
 But these people are rough and
 desperate. They wouldn't be
 fooled by anything that crude.""


 ""Well, you're calling it,"" said
 Bal.


 ""All right,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""You take one side and I the
 other. We'll tell them bluntly
 what they'll have to do if they're
 going to survive, how they can
 keep their planet in one piece so
 they can live on it.""


 ""That'll go over big. Advice is
 always popular.""


 ""Can't help it. That's all we
 have time for.""


 ""Special instructions?""


 ""None. We leave the ship here
 and go down in separate landing
 craft. You can talk with me any
 time you want to through our
 communications, but don't unless
 you have to.""


 ""They can't intercept the
 beams we use.""


 ""They can't, and even if they
 did they wouldn't know what to
 do with our language. I want
 them to think that we don't
need
to talk things over.""


 ""I get it. Makes us seem better
 than we are. They think we know
 exactly what we're doing even
 though we don't.""


 ""If we're lucky they'll think
 that.""
Bal looked out of the port at
 the planet below. ""It's going to
 be cold where I'm going. You too.
 Sure we don't want to change
 our plans and land in the southern
 hemisphere? It's summer
 there.""


 ""I'm afraid not. The great
 powers are in the north. They
 are the ones we have to reach to
 do the job.""


 ""Yeah, but I was thinking of
 that holiday you mentioned.
 We'll be running straight into it.
 That won't help us any.""


 ""I know, they don't like their
 holidays interrupted. It can't be
 helped. We can't wait until it's
 over.""


 ""I'm aware of that,"" said Bal.
 ""Fill me in on that holiday, anything
 I ought to know. Probably
 religious in origin. That so?""


 ""It was religious a long time
 ago,"" said Ethaniel. ""I didn't
 learn anything exact from radio
 and TV. Now it seems to be
 chiefly a time for eating, office
 parties, and selling merchandise.""


 ""I see. It has become a business
 holiday.""


 ""That's a good description. I
 didn't get as much of it as I
 ought to have. I was busy studying
 the people, and they're hard
 to pin down.""


 ""I see. I was thinking there
 might be some way we could tie
 ourselves in with this holiday.
 Make it work for us.""


 ""If there is I haven't thought
 of it.""


 ""You ought to know. You're
 running this one."" Bal looked
 down at the planet. Clouds were
 beginning to form at the twilight
 edge. ""I hate to go down
 and leave the ship up here with
 no one in it.""


 ""They can't touch it. No matter
 how they develop in the next
 hundred years they still won't be
 able to get in or damage it in
 any way.""


 ""It's myself I'm thinking
 about. Down there, alone.""


 ""I'll be with you. On the other
 side of the Earth.""


 ""That's not very close. I'd like
 it better if there were someone
 in the ship to bring it down in a
 hurry if things get rough. They
 don't think much of each other.
 I don't imagine they'll like aliens
 any better.""


 ""They may be unfriendly,""
 Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he
 switched a monitor screen until
 he looked at the slope of a mountain.
 It was snowing and men
 were cutting small green trees in
 the snow. ""I've thought of a
 trick.""


 ""If it saves my neck I'm for
 it.""


 ""I don't guarantee anything,""
 said Ethaniel. ""This is what I
 was thinking of: instead of hiding
 the ship against the sun
 where there's little chance it will
 be seen, we'll make sure that
 they do see it. Let's take it
 around to the night side of the
 planet and light it up.""


 ""Say, pretty good,"" said Bal.


 ""They can't imagine that we'd
 light up an unmanned ship,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""Even if the thought
 should occur to them they'll have
 no way of checking it. Also, they
 won't be eager to harm us with
 our ship shining down on them.""


 ""That's thinking,"" said Bal,
 moving to the controls. ""I'll move
 the ship over where they can see
 it best and then I'll light it up.
 I'll really light it up.""


 ""Don't spare power.""


 ""Don't worry about that.
 They'll see it. Everybody on
 Earth will see it."" Later, with the
 ship in position, glowing against
 the darkness of space, pulsating
 with light, Bal said: ""You know,
 I feel better about this. We may
 pull it off. Lighting the ship may
 be just the help we need.""


 ""It's not we who need help, but
 the people of Earth,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""See you in five days."" With
 that he entered a small landing
 craft, which left a faintly luminescent
 trail as it plunged toward
 Earth. As soon as it was
 safe to do so, Bal left in another
 craft, heading for the other side
 of the planet.
And the spaceship circled
 Earth, unmanned, blazing and
 pulsing with light. No star in the
 winter skies of the planet below
 could equal it in brilliancy. Once
 a man-made satellite came near
 but it was dim and was lost sight
 of by the people below. During
 the day the ship was visible as
 a bright spot of light. At evening
 it seemed to burn through
 the sunset colors.


 And the ship circled on,
 bright, shining, seeming to be a
 little piece clipped from the center
 of a star and brought near
 Earth to illuminate it. Never, or
 seldom, had Earth seen anything
 like it.


 In five days the two small landing
 craft that had left it arched
 up from Earth and joined the
 orbit of the large ship. The two
 small craft slid inside the large
 one and doors closed behind
 them. In a short time the aliens
 met again.


 ""We did it,"" said Bal exultantly
 as he came in. ""I don't know
 how we did it and I thought we
 were going to fail but at the last
 minute they came through.""


 Ethaniel smiled. ""I'm tired,""
 he said, rustling.


 ""Me too, but mostly I'm cold,""
 said Bal, shivering. ""Snow.
 Nothing but snow wherever I
 went. Miserable climate. And yet
 you had me go out walking after
 that first day.""


 ""From my own experience it
 seemed to be a good idea,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""If I went out walking
 one day I noticed that the next
 day the officials were much more
 cooperative. If it worked for me
 I thought it might help you.""


 ""It did. I don't know why, but
 it did,"" said Bal. ""Anyway, this
 agreement they made isn't the
 best but I think it will keep them
 from destroying themselves.""


 ""It's as much as we can expect,""
 said Ethaniel. ""They may
 have small wars after this, but
 never the big one. In fifty or a
 hundred years we can come back
 and see how much they've
 learned.""


 ""I'm not sure I want to,"" said
 Bal. ""Say, what's an angel?""


 ""Why?""


 ""When I went out walking
 people stopped to look. Some
 knelt in the snow and called me
 an angel.""


 ""Something like that happened
 to me,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""I didn't get it but I didn't let
 it upset me,"" said Bal. ""I smiled
 at them and went about my business.""
 He shivered again. ""It was
 always cold. I walked out, but
 sometimes I flew back. I hope
 that was all right.""


 In the cabin Bal spread his
 great wings. Renaissance painters
 had never seen his like but
 knew exactly how he looked. In
 their paintings they had pictured
 him innumerable times.


 ""I don't think it hurt us that
 you flew,"" said Ethaniel. ""I did
 so myself occasionally.""


 ""But you don't know what an
 angel is?""


 ""No. I didn't have time to find
 out. Some creature of their folklore
 I suppose. You know, except
 for our wings they're very much
 like ourselves. Their legends are
 bound to resemble ours.""


 ""Sure,"" said Bal. ""Anyway,
 peace on Earth.""

 Me? Oh,
I'm A Stranger
 
Here Myself
By MACK REYNOLDS
The
 Place de France is the
 town's hub. It marks the end
 of Boulevard Pasteur, the main
 drag of the westernized part of
 the city, and the beginning of
 Rue de la Liberté, which leads
 down to the Grand Socco and
 the medina. In a three-minute
 walk from the Place de France
 you can go from an ultra-modern,
 California-like resort to the
 Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.


 It's quite a town, Tangier.


 King-size sidewalk cafes occupy
 three of the strategic
 corners on the Place de France.
 The Cafe de Paris serves the
 best draft beer in town, gets all
 the better custom, and has three
 shoeshine boys attached to the
 establishment. You can sit of a
 sunny morning and read the
 Paris edition of the New York
Herald Tribune
while getting
 your shoes done up like mirrors
 for thirty Moroccan francs
 which comes to about five cents
 at current exchange.


 You can sit there, after the
 paper's read, sip your expresso
 and watch the people go by.


 Tangier is possibly the most
 cosmopolitan city in the world.
 In native costume you'll see
 Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue
 Man, and occasionally a Senegalese
 from further south. In
 European dress you'll see Japs
 and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,
 Levantines and Filipinos, North
 Americans and South Americans,
 and, of course, even Europeans—from
 both sides of the
 Curtain.


 In Tangier you'll find some of
 the world's poorest and some of
 the richest. The poorest will try
 to sell you anything from a
 shoeshine to their not very lily-white
 bodies, and the richest will
 avoid your eyes, afraid
you
might try to sell them something.


 In spite of recent changes, the
 town still has its unique qualities.
 As a result of them the permanent
 population includes
 smugglers and black-marketeers,
 fugitives from justice and international
 con men, espionage
 and counter-espionage agents,
 homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,
 drug addicts, displaced
 persons, ex-royalty, and subversives
 of every flavor. Local law
 limits the activities of few of
 these.


 Like I said, it's quite a town.
I looked up from my
Herald
 Tribune
and said, ""Hello, Paul.
 Anything new cooking?""


 He sank into the chair opposite
 me and looked around for
 the waiter. The tables were all
 crowded and since mine was a
 face he recognized, he assumed
 he was welcome to intrude. It was
 more or less standard procedure
 at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't
 a place to go if you wanted to
 be alone.


 Paul said, ""How are you,
 Rupert? Haven't seen you for
 donkey's years.""


 The waiter came along and
 Paul ordered a glass of beer.
 Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced
 little man. I vaguely remembered
 somebody saying he
 was from Liverpool and in
 exports.


 ""What's in the newspaper?""
 he said, disinterestedly.


 ""Pogo and Albert are going
 to fight a duel,"" I told him, ""and
 Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll
 singer.""


 He grunted.


 ""Oh,"" I said, ""the intellectual
 type."" I scanned the front page.
 ""The Russkies have put up
 another manned satellite.""


 ""They have, eh? How big?""


 ""Several times bigger than
 anything we Americans have.""


 The beer came and looked
 good, so I ordered a glass too.


 Paul said, ""What ever happened
 to those poxy flying
 saucers?""


 ""What flying saucers?""


 A French girl went by with a
 poodle so finely clipped as to look
 as though it'd been shaven. The
 girl was in the latest from
 Paris. Every pore in place. We
 both looked after her.


 ""You know, what everybody
 was seeing a few years ago. It's
 too bad one of these bloody manned
 satellites wasn't up then.
 Maybe they would've seen one.""


 ""That's an idea,"" I said.


 We didn't say anything else for
 a while and I began to wonder
 if I could go back to my paper
 without rubbing him the wrong
 way. I didn't know Paul very
 well, but, for that matter, it's
 comparatively seldom you ever
 get to know anybody very well
 in Tangier. Largely, cards are
 played close to the chest.
My beer came and a plate of
 tapas for us both. Tapas at the
 Cafe de Paris are apt to be
 potato salad, a few anchovies,
 olives, and possibly some cheese.
 Free lunch, they used to call it
 in the States.


 Just to say something, I said,
 ""Where do you think they came
 from?"" And when he looked
 blank, I added, ""The Flying
 Saucers.""


 He grinned. ""From Mars or
 Venus, or someplace.""


 ""Ummmm,"" I said. ""Too bad
 none of them ever crashed, or
 landed on the Yale football field
 and said
Take me to your cheerleader
,
 or something.""


 Paul yawned and said, ""That
 was always the trouble with those
 crackpot blokes' explanations of
 them. If they were aliens from
 space, then why not show themselves?""


 I ate one of the potato chips.
 It'd been cooked in rancid olive
 oil.


 I said, ""Oh, there are various
 answers to that one. We could
 probably sit around here and
 think of two or three that made
 sense.""


 Paul was mildly interested.
 ""Like what?""


 ""Well, hell, suppose for instance
 there's this big Galactic League
 of civilized planets. But it's restricted,
 see. You're not eligible
 for membership until you, well,
 say until you've developed space
 flight. Then you're invited into
 the club. Meanwhile, they send
 secret missions down from time
 to time to keep an eye on your
 progress.""


 Paul grinned at me. ""I see you
 read the same poxy stuff I do.""


 A Moorish girl went by dressed
 in a neatly tailored gray
 jellaba, European style high-heeled
 shoes, and a pinkish silk
 veil so transparent that you
 could see she wore lipstick. Very
 provocative, dark eyes can be
 over a veil. We both looked
 after her.


 I said, ""Or, here's another
 one. Suppose you have a very
 advanced civilization on, say,
 Mars.""


 ""Not Mars. No air, and too
 bloody dry to support life.""


 ""Don't interrupt, please,"" I
 said with mock severity. ""This
 is a very old civilization and as
 the planet began to lose its
 water and air, it withdrew underground.
 Uses hydroponics and
 so forth, husbands its water and
 air. Isn't that what we'd do, in
 a few million years, if Earth lost
 its water and air?""


 ""I suppose so,"" he said. ""Anyway,
 what about them?""


 ""Well, they observe how man
 is going through a scientific
 boom, an industrial boom, a
 population boom. A boom, period.
 Any day now he's going to have
 practical space ships. Meanwhile,
 he's also got the H-Bomb and
 the way he beats the drums on
 both sides of the Curtain, he's
 not against using it, if he could
 get away with it.""


 Paul said, ""I got it. So they're
 scared and are keeping an eye on
 us. That's an old one. I've read
 that a dozen times, dished up
 different.""


 I shifted my shoulders. ""Well,
 it's one possibility.""


 ""I got a better one. How's
 this. There's this alien life form
 that's way ahead of us. Their
 civilization is so old that they
 don't have any records of when
 it began and how it was in the
 early days. They've gone beyond
 things like wars and depressions
 and revolutions, and greed for
 power or any of these things
 giving us a bad time here on
 Earth. They're all like scholars,
 get it? And some of them are
 pretty jolly well taken by Earth,
 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries
 in the world today. They're trying
 to industrialize, modernize,
 catch up with the advanced countries.
 Look at Egypt, and Israel,
 and India and China, and Yugoslavia
 and Brazil, and all the
 rest. Trying to drag themselves
 up to the level of the advanced
 countries, and all using different
 methods of doing it. But look
 at the so-called advanced countries.
 Up to their bottoms in
 problems. Juvenile delinquents,
 climbing crime and suicide rates,
 the loony-bins full of the balmy,
 unemployed, threat of war,
 spending all their money on armaments
 instead of things like
 schools. All the bloody mess of
 it. Why, a man from Mars would
 be fascinated, like.""


 Mouley came shuffling up in
 his babouche slippers and we
 both ordered another schooner
 of beer.


 Paul said seriously, ""You
 know, there's only one big snag
 in this sort of talk. I've sorted
 the whole thing out before, and
 you always come up against this
 brick wall. Where are they, these
 observers, or scholars, or spies
 or whatever they are? Sooner
 or later we'd nab one of them.
 You know, Scotland Yard, or
 the F.B.I., or Russia's secret
 police, or the French Sûreté, or
 Interpol. This world is so deep
 in police, counter-espionage outfits
 and security agents that an
 alien would slip up in time, no
 matter how much he'd been
 trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip
 up, and they'd nab him.""


 I shook my head. ""Not necessarily.
 The first time I ever considered
 this possibility, it seemed
 to me that such an alien would
 base himself in London or New
 York. Somewhere where he could
 use the libraries for research,
 get the daily newspapers and
 the magazines. Be right in the
 center of things. But now I don't
 think so. I think he'd be right
 here in Tangier.""


 ""Why Tangier?""


 ""It's the one town in the world
 where anything goes. Nobody
 gives a damn about you or your
 affairs. For instance, I've known
 you a year or more now, and I
 haven't the slightest idea of how
 you make your living.""


 ""That's right,"" Paul admitted.
 ""In this town you seldom even
 ask a man where's he's from. He
 can be British, a White Russian,
 a Basque or a Sikh and nobody
 could care less. Where are
you
from, Rupert?""


 ""California,"" I told him.


 ""No, you're not,"" he grinned.


 I was taken aback. ""What do
 you mean?""


 ""I felt your mind probe back
 a few minutes ago when I was
 talking about Scotland Yard or
 the F.B.I. possibly flushing an
 alien. Telepathy is a sense not
 trained by the humanoids. If
 they had it, your job—and mine—would
 be considerably more
 difficult. Let's face it, in spite of
 these human bodies we're disguised
 in, neither of us is
 humanoid. Where are you really
 from, Rupert?""


 ""Aldebaran,"" I said. ""How
 about you?""


 ""Deneb,"" he told me, shaking.


 We had a laugh and ordered
 another beer.


 ""What're you doing here on
 Earth?"" I asked him.


 ""Researching for one of our
 meat trusts. We're protein
 eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered
 quite a delicacy. How
 about you?""


 ""Scouting the place for thrill
 tourists. My job is to go around
 to these backward cultures and
 help stir up inter-tribal, or international,
 conflicts—all according
 to how advanced they
 are. Then our tourists come in—well
 shielded, of course—and get
 their kicks watching it.""


 Paul frowned. ""That sort of
 practice could spoil an awful
 lot of good meat.""

 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries
 in the world today. They're trying
 to industrialize, modernize,
 catch up with the advanced countries.
 Look at Egypt, and Israel,
 and India and China, and Yugoslavia
 and Brazil, and all the
 rest. Trying to drag themselves
 up to the level of the advanced
 countries, and all using different
 methods of doing it. But look
 at the so-called advanced countries.
 Up to their bottoms in
 problems. Juvenile delinquents,
 climbing crime and suicide rates,
 the loony-bins full of the balmy,
 unemployed, threat of war,
 spending all their money on armaments
 instead of things like
 schools. All the bloody mess of
 it. Why, a man from Mars would
 be fascinated, like.""


 Mouley came shuffling up in
 his babouche slippers and we
 both ordered another schooner
 of beer.


 Paul said seriously, ""You
 know, there's only one big snag
 in this sort of talk. I've sorted
 the whole thing out before, and
 you always come up against this
 brick wall. Where are they, these
 observers, or scholars, or spies
 or whatever they are? Sooner
 or later we'd nab one of them.
 You know, Scotland Yard, or
 the F.B.I., or Russia's secret
 police, or the French Sûreté, or
 Interpol. This world is so deep
 in police, counter-espionage outfits
 and security agents that an
 alien would slip up in time, no
 matter how much he'd been
 trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip
 up, and they'd nab him.""


 I shook my head. ""Not necessarily.
 The first time I ever considered
 this possibility, it seemed
 to me that such an alien would
 base himself in London or New
 York. Somewhere where he could
 use the libraries for research,
 get the daily newspapers and
 the magazines. Be right in the
 center of things. But now I don't
 think so. I think he'd be right
 here in Tangier.""


 ""Why Tangier?""


 ""It's the one town in the world
 where anything goes. Nobody
 gives a damn about you or your
 affairs. For instance, I've known
 you a year or more now, and I
 haven't the slightest idea of how
 you make your living.""


 ""That's right,"" Paul admitted.
 ""In this town you seldom even
 ask a man where's he's from. He
 can be British, a White Russian,
 a Basque or a Sikh and nobody
 could care less. Where are
you
from, Rupert?""


 ""California,"" I told him.


 ""No, you're not,"" he grinned.


 I was taken aback. ""What do
 you mean?""


 ""I felt your mind probe back
 a few minutes ago when I was
 talking about Scotland Yard or
 the F.B.I. possibly flushing an
 alien. Telepathy is a sense not
 trained by the humanoids. If
 they had it, your job—and mine—would
 be considerably more
 difficult. Let's face it, in spite of
 these human bodies we're disguised
 in, neither of us is
 humanoid. Where are you really
 from, Rupert?""


 ""Aldebaran,"" I said. ""How
 about you?""


 ""Deneb,"" he told me, shaking.


 We had a laugh and ordered
 another beer.


 ""What're you doing here on
 Earth?"" I asked him.


 ""Researching for one of our
 meat trusts. We're protein
 eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered
 quite a delicacy. How
 about you?""


 ""Scouting the place for thrill
 tourists. My job is to go around
 to these backward cultures and
 help stir up inter-tribal, or international,
 conflicts—all according
 to how advanced they
 are. Then our tourists come in—well
 shielded, of course—and get
 their kicks watching it.""


 Paul frowned. ""That sort of
 practice could spoil an awful
 lot of good meat.""

 Me? Oh,
I'm A Stranger
 
Here Myself
By MACK REYNOLDS
The
 Place de France is the
 town's hub. It marks the end
 of Boulevard Pasteur, the main
 drag of the westernized part of
 the city, and the beginning of
 Rue de la Liberté, which leads
 down to the Grand Socco and
 the medina. In a three-minute
 walk from the Place de France
 you can go from an ultra-modern,
 California-like resort to the
 Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.


 It's quite a town, Tangier.


 King-size sidewalk cafes occupy
 three of the strategic
 corners on the Place de France.
 The Cafe de Paris serves the
 best draft beer in town, gets all
 the better custom, and has three
 shoeshine boys attached to the
 establishment. You can sit of a
 sunny morning and read the
 Paris edition of the New York
Herald Tribune
while getting
 your shoes done up like mirrors
 for thirty Moroccan francs
 which comes to about five cents
 at current exchange.


 You can sit there, after the
 paper's read, sip your expresso
 and watch the people go by.


 Tangier is possibly the most
 cosmopolitan city in the world.
 In native costume you'll see
 Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue
 Man, and occasionally a Senegalese
 from further south. In
 European dress you'll see Japs
 and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,
 Levantines and Filipinos, North
 Americans and South Americans,
 and, of course, even Europeans—from
 both sides of the
 Curtain.


 In Tangier you'll find some of
 the world's poorest and some of
 the richest. The poorest will try
 to sell you anything from a
 shoeshine to their not very lily-white
 bodies, and the richest will
 avoid your eyes, afraid
you
might try to sell them something.


 In spite of recent changes, the
 town still has its unique qualities.
 As a result of them the permanent
 population includes
 smugglers and black-marketeers,
 fugitives from justice and international
 con men, espionage
 and counter-espionage agents,
 homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,
 drug addicts, displaced
 persons, ex-royalty, and subversives
 of every flavor. Local law
 limits the activities of few of
 these.


 Like I said, it's quite a town.
I looked up from my
Herald
 Tribune
and said, ""Hello, Paul.
 Anything new cooking?""


 He sank into the chair opposite
 me and looked around for
 the waiter. The tables were all
 crowded and since mine was a
 face he recognized, he assumed
 he was welcome to intrude. It was
 more or less standard procedure
 at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't
 a place to go if you wanted to
 be alone.


 Paul said, ""How are you,
 Rupert? Haven't seen you for
 donkey's years.""


 The waiter came along and
 Paul ordered a glass of beer.
 Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced
 little man. I vaguely remembered
 somebody saying he
 was from Liverpool and in
 exports.


 ""What's in the newspaper?""
 he said, disinterestedly.


 ""Pogo and Albert are going
 to fight a duel,"" I told him, ""and
 Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll
 singer.""


 He grunted.


 ""Oh,"" I said, ""the intellectual
 type."" I scanned the front page.
 ""The Russkies have put up
 another manned satellite.""


 ""They have, eh? How big?""


 ""Several times bigger than
 anything we Americans have.""


 The beer came and looked
 good, so I ordered a glass too.


 Paul said, ""What ever happened
 to those poxy flying
 saucers?""


 ""What flying saucers?""


 A French girl went by with a
 poodle so finely clipped as to look
 as though it'd been shaven. The
 girl was in the latest from
 Paris. Every pore in place. We
 both looked after her.


 ""You know, what everybody
 was seeing a few years ago. It's
 too bad one of these bloody manned
 satellites wasn't up then.
 Maybe they would've seen one.""


 ""That's an idea,"" I said.


 We didn't say anything else for
 a while and I began to wonder
 if I could go back to my paper
 without rubbing him the wrong
 way. I didn't know Paul very
 well, but, for that matter, it's
 comparatively seldom you ever
 get to know anybody very well
 in Tangier. Largely, cards are
 played close to the chest.
My beer came and a plate of
 tapas for us both. Tapas at the
 Cafe de Paris are apt to be
 potato salad, a few anchovies,
 olives, and possibly some cheese.
 Free lunch, they used to call it
 in the States.


 Just to say something, I said,
 ""Where do you think they came
 from?"" And when he looked
 blank, I added, ""The Flying
 Saucers.""


 He grinned. ""From Mars or
 Venus, or someplace.""


 ""Ummmm,"" I said. ""Too bad
 none of them ever crashed, or
 landed on the Yale football field
 and said
Take me to your cheerleader
,
 or something.""


 Paul yawned and said, ""That
 was always the trouble with those
 crackpot blokes' explanations of
 them. If they were aliens from
 space, then why not show themselves?""


 I ate one of the potato chips.
 It'd been cooked in rancid olive
 oil.


 I said, ""Oh, there are various
 answers to that one. We could
 probably sit around here and
 think of two or three that made
 sense.""


 Paul was mildly interested.
 ""Like what?""


 ""Well, hell, suppose for instance
 there's this big Galactic League
 of civilized planets. But it's restricted,
 see. You're not eligible
 for membership until you, well,
 say until you've developed space
 flight. Then you're invited into
 the club. Meanwhile, they send
 secret missions down from time
 to time to keep an eye on your
 progress.""


 Paul grinned at me. ""I see you
 read the same poxy stuff I do.""


 A Moorish girl went by dressed
 in a neatly tailored gray
 jellaba, European style high-heeled
 shoes, and a pinkish silk
 veil so transparent that you
 could see she wore lipstick. Very
 provocative, dark eyes can be
 over a veil. We both looked
 after her.


 I said, ""Or, here's another
 one. Suppose you have a very
 advanced civilization on, say,
 Mars.""


 ""Not Mars. No air, and too
 bloody dry to support life.""


 ""Don't interrupt, please,"" I
 said with mock severity. ""This
 is a very old civilization and as
 the planet began to lose its
 water and air, it withdrew underground.
 Uses hydroponics and
 so forth, husbands its water and
 air. Isn't that what we'd do, in
 a few million years, if Earth lost
 its water and air?""


 ""I suppose so,"" he said. ""Anyway,
 what about them?""


 ""Well, they observe how man
 is going through a scientific
 boom, an industrial boom, a
 population boom. A boom, period.
 Any day now he's going to have
 practical space ships. Meanwhile,
 he's also got the H-Bomb and
 the way he beats the drums on
 both sides of the Curtain, he's
 not against using it, if he could
 get away with it.""


 Paul said, ""I got it. So they're
 scared and are keeping an eye on
 us. That's an old one. I've read
 that a dozen times, dished up
 different.""


 I shifted my shoulders. ""Well,
 it's one possibility.""


 ""I got a better one. How's
 this. There's this alien life form
 that's way ahead of us. Their
 civilization is so old that they
 don't have any records of when
 it began and how it was in the
 early days. They've gone beyond
 things like wars and depressions
 and revolutions, and greed for
 power or any of these things
 giving us a bad time here on
 Earth. They're all like scholars,
 get it? And some of them are
 pretty jolly well taken by Earth,
 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries

 Place de France is the
 town's hub. It marks the end
 of Boulevard Pasteur, the main
 drag of the westernized part of
 the city, and the beginning of
 Rue de la Liberté, which leads
 down to the Grand Socco and
 the medina. In a three-minute
 walk from the Place de France
 you can go from an ultra-modern,
 California-like resort to the
 Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.


 It's quite a town, Tangier.


 King-size sidewalk cafes occupy
 three of the strategic
 corners on the Place de France.
 The Cafe de Paris serves the
 best draft beer in town, gets all
 the better custom, and has three
 shoeshine boys attached to the
 establishment. You can sit of a
 sunny morning and read the
 Paris edition of the New York
Herald Tribune
while getting
 your shoes done up like mirrors
 for thirty Moroccan francs
 which comes to about five cents
 at current exchange.


 You can sit there, after the
 paper's read, sip your expresso
 and watch the people go by.


 Tangier is possibly the most
 cosmopolitan city in the world.
 In native costume you'll see
 Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue
 Man, and occasionally a Senegalese
 from further south. In
 European dress you'll see Japs
 and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,
 Levantines and Filipinos, North
 Americans and South Americans,
 and, of course, even Europeans—from
 both sides of the
 Curtain.


 In Tangier you'll find some of
 the world's poorest and some of
 the richest. The poorest will try
 to sell you anything from a
 shoeshine to their not very lily-white
 bodies, and the richest will
 avoid your eyes, afraid
you
might try to sell them something.


 In spite of recent changes, the
 town still has its unique qualities.
 As a result of them the permanent
 population includes
 smugglers and black-marketeers,
 fugitives from justice and international
 con men, espionage
 and counter-espionage agents,
 homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,
 drug addicts, displaced
 persons, ex-royalty, and subversives
 of every flavor. Local law
 limits the activities of few of
 these.


 Like I said, it's quite a town.
I looked up from my
Herald
 Tribune
and said, ""Hello, Paul.
 Anything new cooking?""


 He sank into the chair opposite
 me and looked around for
 the waiter. The tables were all
 crowded and since mine was a
 face he recognized, he assumed
 he was welcome to intrude. It was
 more or less standard procedure
 at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't
 a place to go if you wanted to
 be alone.


 Paul said, ""How are you,
 Rupert? Haven't seen you for
 donkey's years.""


 The waiter came along and
 Paul ordered a glass of beer.
 Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced
 little man. I vaguely remembered
 somebody saying he
 was from Liverpool and in
 exports.


 ""What's in the newspaper?""
 he said, disinterestedly.


 ""Pogo and Albert are going
 to fight a duel,"" I told him, ""and
 Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll
 singer.""


 He grunted.


 ""Oh,"" I said, ""the intellectual
 type."" I scanned the front page.
 ""The Russkies have put up
 another manned satellite.""


 ""They have, eh? How big?""


 ""Several times bigger than
 anything we Americans have.""


 The beer came and looked
 good, so I ordered a glass too.


 Paul said, ""What ever happened
 to those poxy flying
 saucers?""


 ""What flying saucers?""


 A French girl went by with a
 poodle so finely clipped as to look
 as though it'd been shaven. The
 girl was in the latest from
 Paris. Every pore in place. We
 both looked after her.


 ""You know, what everybody
 was seeing a few years ago. It's
 too bad one of these bloody manned
 satellites wasn't up then.
 Maybe they would've seen one.""


 ""That's an idea,"" I said.


 We didn't say anything else for
 a while and I began to wonder
 if I could go back to my paper
 without rubbing him the wrong
 way. I didn't know Paul very
 well, but, for that matter, it's
 comparatively seldom you ever
 get to know anybody very well
 in Tangier. Largely, cards are
 played close to the chest.
My beer came and a plate of
 tapas for us both. Tapas at the
 Cafe de Paris are apt to be
 potato salad, a few anchovies,
 olives, and possibly some cheese.
 Free lunch, they used to call it
 in the States.


 Just to say something, I said,
 ""Where do you think they came
 from?"" And when he looked
 blank, I added, ""The Flying
 Saucers.""


 He grinned. ""From Mars or
 Venus, or someplace.""


 ""Ummmm,"" I said. ""Too bad
 none of them ever crashed, or
 landed on the Yale football field
 and said
Take me to your cheerleader
,
 or something.""


 Paul yawned and said, ""That
 was always the trouble with those
 crackpot blokes' explanations of
 them. If they were aliens from
 space, then why not show themselves?""


 I ate one of the potato chips.
 It'd been cooked in rancid olive
 oil.


 I said, ""Oh, there are various
 answers to that one. We could
 probably sit around here and
 think of two or three that made
 sense.""


 Paul was mildly interested.
 ""Like what?""


 ""Well, hell, suppose for instance
 there's this big Galactic League
 of civilized planets. But it's restricted,
 see. You're not eligible
 for membership until you, well,
 say until you've developed space
 flight. Then you're invited into
 the club. Meanwhile, they send
 secret missions down from time
 to time to keep an eye on your
 progress.""


 Paul grinned at me. ""I see you
 read the same poxy stuff I do.""


 A Moorish girl went by dressed
 in a neatly tailored gray
 jellaba, European style high-heeled
 shoes, and a pinkish silk
 veil so transparent that you
 could see she wore lipstick. Very
 provocative, dark eyes can be
 over a veil. We both looked
 after her.


 I said, ""Or, here's another
 one. Suppose you have a very
 advanced civilization on, say,
 Mars.""


 ""Not Mars. No air, and too
 bloody dry to support life.""


 ""Don't interrupt, please,"" I
 said with mock severity. ""This
 is a very old civilization and as
 the planet began to lose its
 water and air, it withdrew underground.
 Uses hydroponics and
 so forth, husbands its water and
 air. Isn't that what we'd do, in
 a few million years, if Earth lost
 its water and air?""


 ""I suppose so,"" he said. ""Anyway,
 what about them?""


 ""Well, they observe how man
 is going through a scientific
 boom, an industrial boom, a
 population boom. A boom, period.
 Any day now he's going to have
 practical space ships. Meanwhile,
 he's also got the H-Bomb and
 the way he beats the drums on
 both sides of the Curtain, he's
 not against using it, if he could
 get away with it.""


 Paul said, ""I got it. So they're
 scared and are keeping an eye on
 us. That's an old one. I've read
 that a dozen times, dished up
 different.""


 I shifted my shoulders. ""Well,
 it's one possibility.""


 ""I got a better one. How's
 this. There's this alien life form
 that's way ahead of us. Their
 civilization is so old that they
 don't have any records of when
 it began and how it was in the
 early days. They've gone beyond
 things like wars and depressions
 and revolutions, and greed for
 power or any of these things
 giving us a bad time here on
 Earth. They're all like scholars,
 get it? And some of them are
 pretty jolly well taken by Earth,
 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries
 in the world today. They're trying
 to industrialize, modernize,
 catch up with the advanced countries.
 Look at Egypt, and Israel,
 and India and China, and Yugoslavia
 and Brazil, and all the
 rest. Trying to drag themselves
 up to the level of the advanced
 countries, and all using different
 methods of doing it. But look
 at the so-called advanced countries.
 Up to their bottoms in
 problems. Juvenile delinquents,
 climbing crime and suicide rates,
 the loony-bins full of the balmy,
 unemployed, threat of war,
 spending all their money on armaments
 instead of things like
 schools. All the bloody mess of
 it. Why, a man from Mars would
 be fascinated, like.""


 Mouley came shuffling up in
 his babouche slippers and we
 both ordered another schooner
 of beer.


 Paul said seriously, ""You
 know, there's only one big snag
 in this sort of talk. I've sorted
 the whole thing out before, and
 you always come up against this
 brick wall. Where are they, these
 observers, or scholars, or spies
 or whatever they are? Sooner
 or later we'd nab one of them.
 You know, Scotland Yard, or
 the F.B.I., or Russia's secret
 police, or the French Sûreté, or
 Interpol. This world is so deep
 in police, counter-espionage outfits
 and security agents that an
 alien would slip up in time, no
 matter how much he'd been
 trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip
 up, and they'd nab him.""


 I shook my head. ""Not necessarily.
 The first time I ever considered
 this possibility, it seemed
 to me that such an alien would
 base himself in London or New
 York. Somewhere where he could
 use the libraries for research,
 get the daily newspapers and
 the magazines. Be right in the
 center of things. But now I don't
 think so. I think he'd be right
 here in Tangier.""


 ""Why Tangier?""


 ""It's the one town in the world
 where anything goes. Nobody
 gives a damn about you or your
 affairs. For instance, I've known
 you a year or more now, and I
 haven't the slightest idea of how
 you make your living.""


 ""That's right,"" Paul admitted.
 ""In this town you seldom even
 ask a man where's he's from. He
 can be British, a White Russian,
 a Basque or a Sikh and nobody
 could care less. Where are
you
from, Rupert?""


 ""California,"" I told him.


 ""No, you're not,"" he grinned.


 I was taken aback. ""What do
 you mean?""


 ""I felt your mind probe back
 a few minutes ago when I was
 talking about Scotland Yard or
 the F.B.I. possibly flushing an
 alien. Telepathy is a sense not
 trained by the humanoids. If
 they had it, your job—and mine—would
 be considerably more
 difficult. Let's face it, in spite of
 these human bodies we're disguised
 in, neither of us is
 humanoid. Where are you really
 from, Rupert?""


 ""Aldebaran,"" I said. ""How
 about you?""


 ""Deneb,"" he told me, shaking.


 We had a laugh and ordered
 another beer.


 ""What're you doing here on
 Earth?"" I asked him.


 ""Researching for one of our
 meat trusts. We're protein
 eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered
 quite a delicacy. How
 about you?""


 ""Scouting the place for thrill
 tourists. My job is to go around
 to these backward cultures and
 help stir up inter-tribal, or international,
 conflicts—all according
 to how advanced they
 are. Then our tourists come in—well
 shielded, of course—and get
 their kicks watching it.""


 Paul frowned. ""That sort of
 practice could spoil an awful
 lot of good meat.""

49,"SECOND LANDING
By FLOYD WALLACE
A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season—an
 oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something
 that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer.
Earth
 was so far away that
 it wasn't visible. Even the
 sun was only a twinkle. But this
 vast distance did not mean that
 isolation could endure forever.
 Instruments within the ship intercepted
 radio broadcasts and,
 within the hour, early TV signals.
 Machines compiled dictionaries
 and grammars and began
 translating the major languages.
 The history of the planet was
 tabulated as facts became available.


 The course of the ship changed
 slightly; it was not much out of
 the way to swing nearer Earth.
 For days the two within the ship
 listened and watched with little
 comment. They had to decide
 soon.


 ""We've got to make or break,""
 said the first alien.


 ""You know what I'm in favor
 of,"" said the second.


 ""I can guess,"" said Ethaniel,
 who had spoken first. ""The place
 is a complete mess. They've never
 done anything except fight
 each other—and invent better
 weapons.""


 ""It's not what they've done,""
 said Bal, the second alien. ""It's
 what they're going to do, with
 that big bomb.""


 ""The more reason for stopping,""
 said Ethaniel. ""The big
 bomb can destroy them. Without
 our help they may do just that.""


 ""I may remind you that in two
 months twenty-nine days we're
 due in Willafours,"" said Bal.
 ""Without looking at the charts
 I can tell you we still have more
 than a hundred light-years to
 go.""


 ""A week,"" said Ethaniel. ""We
 can spare a week and still get
 there on time.""


 ""A week?"" said Bal. ""To settle
 their problems? They've had two
 world wars in one generation
 and that the third and final one
 is coming up you can't help feeling
 in everything they do.""


 ""It won't take much,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""The wrong diplomatic
 move, or a trigger-happy soldier
 could set it off. And it wouldn't
 have to be deliberate. A meteor
 shower could pass over and their
 clumsy instruments could interpret
 it as an all-out enemy
 attack.""


 ""Too bad,"" said Bal. ""We'll
 just have to forget there ever
 was such a planet as Earth.""


 ""Could you? Forget so many
 people?""


 ""I'm doing it,"" said Bal. ""Just
 give them a little time and they
 won't be here to remind me that
 I have a conscience.""


 ""My memory isn't convenient,""
 said Ethaniel. ""I ask you
 to look at them.""
Bal rustled, flicking the screen
 intently. ""Very much like ourselves,""
 he said at last. ""A bit
 shorter perhaps, and most certainly
 incomplete. Except for the
 one thing they lack, and that's
 quite odd, they seem exactly like
 us. Is that what you wanted me
 to say?""


 ""It is. The fact that they are
 an incomplete version of ourselves
 touches me. They actually
 seem defenseless, though I suppose
 they're not.""


 ""Tough,"" said Bal. ""Nothing
 we can do about it.""


 ""There is. We can give them
 a week.""


 ""In a week we can't negate
 their entire history. We can't
 begin to undo the effect of the
 big bomb.""


 ""You can't tell,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""We can look things over.""


 ""And then what? How much
 authority do we have?""


 ""Very little,"" conceded Ethaniel.
 ""Two minor officials on the
 way to Willafours—and we run
 directly into a problem no one
 knew existed.""


 ""And when we get to Willafours
 we'll be busy. It will be a
 long time before anyone comes
 this way again.""


 ""A very long time. There's
 nothing in this region of space
 our people want,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""And how long can Earth last?
 Ten years? Even ten months?
 The tension is building by the
 hour.""


 ""What can I say?"" said Bal.
 ""I suppose we can stop and look
 them over. We're not committing
 ourselves by looking.""


 They went much closer to
 Earth, not intending to commit
 themselves. For a day they circled
 the planet, avoiding radar
 detection, which for them was
 not difficult, testing, and sampling.
 Finally Ethaniel looked up
 from the monitor screen. ""Any
 conclusions?""


 ""What's there to think? It's
 worse than I imagined.""


 ""In what way?""


 ""Well, we knew they had the
 big bomb. Atmospheric analysis
 showed that as far away as we
 were.""


 ""I know.""


 ""We also knew they could deliver
 the big bomb, presumably
 by some sort of aircraft.""


 ""That was almost a certainty.
 They'd have no use for the big
 bomb without aircraft.""


 ""What's worse is that I now
 find they also have missiles,
 range one thousand miles and
 upward. They either have or are
 near a primitive form of space
 travel.""


 ""Bad,"" said Ethaniel. ""Sitting
 there, wondering when it's going
 to hit them. Nervousness could
 set it off.""


 ""It could, and the missiles
 make it worse,"" said Bal. ""What
 did you find out at your end?""


 ""Nothing worthwhile. I was
 looking at the people while you
 were investigating their weapons.""


 ""You must think something.""


 ""I wish I knew what to think.
 There's so little time,"" Ethaniel
 said. ""Language isn't the difficulty.
 Our machines translate
 their languages easily and I've
 taken a cram course in two or
 three of them. But that's not
 enough, looking at a few plays,
 listening to advertisements, music,
 and news bulletins. I should
 go down and live among them,
 read books, talk to scholars, work
 with them, play.""


 ""You could do that and you'd
 really get to know them. But
 that takes time—and we don't
 have it.""


 ""I realize that.""


 ""A flat yes or no,"" said Bal.


 ""No. We can't help them,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""There is nothing we
 can do for them—but we have to
 try.""


 ""Sure, I knew it before we
 started,"" said Bal. ""It's happened
 before. We take the trouble to
 find out what a people are like
 and when we can't help them we
 feel bad. It's going to be that
 way again."" He rose and stretched.
 ""Well, give me an hour to
 think of some way of going at
 it.""
It was longer than that before
 they met again. In the meantime
 the ship moved much closer to
 Earth. They no longer needed instruments
 to see it. The planet
 revolved outside the visionports.
 The southern plains were green,
 coursed with rivers; the oceans
 were blue; and much of the
 northern hemisphere was glistening
 white. Ragged clouds covered
 the pole, and a dirty pall
 spread over the mid-regions of
 the north.


 ""I haven't thought of anything
 brilliant,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""Nor I,"" said Bal. ""We're going
 to have to go down there
 cold. And it will be cold.""


 ""Yes. It's their winter.""


 ""I did have an idea,"" said Bal.
 ""What about going down as supernatural
 beings?""


 ""Hardly,"" said Ethaniel. ""A
 hundred years ago it might have
 worked. Today they have satellites.
 They are not primitives.""


 ""I suppose you're right,"" said
 Bal. ""I did think we ought to
 take advantage of our physical
 differences.""


 ""If we could I'd be all for it.
 But these people are rough and
 desperate. They wouldn't be
 fooled by anything that crude.""


 ""Well, you're calling it,"" said
 Bal.


 ""All right,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""You take one side and I the
 other. We'll tell them bluntly
 what they'll have to do if they're
 going to survive, how they can
 keep their planet in one piece so
 they can live on it.""


 ""That'll go over big. Advice is
 always popular.""


 ""Can't help it. That's all we
 have time for.""


 ""Special instructions?""


 ""None. We leave the ship here
 and go down in separate landing
 craft. You can talk with me any
 time you want to through our
 communications, but don't unless
 you have to.""


 ""They can't intercept the
 beams we use.""


 ""They can't, and even if they
 did they wouldn't know what to
 do with our language. I want
 them to think that we don't
need
to talk things over.""


 ""I get it. Makes us seem better
 than we are. They think we know
 exactly what we're doing even
 though we don't.""


 ""If we're lucky they'll think
 that.""
Bal looked out of the port at
 the planet below. ""It's going to
 be cold where I'm going. You too.
 Sure we don't want to change
 our plans and land in the southern
 hemisphere? It's summer
 there.""


 ""I'm afraid not. The great
 powers are in the north. They
 are the ones we have to reach to
 do the job.""


 ""Yeah, but I was thinking of
 that holiday you mentioned.
 We'll be running straight into it.
 That won't help us any.""


 ""I know, they don't like their
 holidays interrupted. It can't be
 helped. We can't wait until it's
 over.""


 ""I'm aware of that,"" said Bal.
 ""Fill me in on that holiday, anything
 I ought to know. Probably
 religious in origin. That so?""


 ""It was religious a long time
 ago,"" said Ethaniel. ""I didn't
 learn anything exact from radio
 and TV. Now it seems to be
 chiefly a time for eating, office
 parties, and selling merchandise.""


 ""I see. It has become a business
 holiday.""


 ""That's a good description. I
 didn't get as much of it as I
 ought to have. I was busy studying
 the people, and they're hard
 to pin down.""


 ""I see. I was thinking there
 might be some way we could tie
 ourselves in with this holiday.
 Make it work for us.""


 ""If there is I haven't thought
 of it.""


 ""You ought to know. You're
 running this one."" Bal looked
 down at the planet. Clouds were
 beginning to form at the twilight
 edge. ""I hate to go down
 and leave the ship up here with
 no one in it.""


 ""They can't touch it. No matter
 how they develop in the next
 hundred years they still won't be
 able to get in or damage it in
 any way.""


 ""It's myself I'm thinking
 about. Down there, alone.""


 ""I'll be with you. On the other
 side of the Earth.""


 ""That's not very close. I'd like
 it better if there were someone
 in the ship to bring it down in a
 hurry if things get rough. They
 don't think much of each other.
 I don't imagine they'll like aliens
 any better.""


 ""They may be unfriendly,""
 Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he
 switched a monitor screen until
 he looked at the slope of a mountain.
 It was snowing and men
 were cutting small green trees in
 the snow. ""I've thought of a
 trick.""


 ""If it saves my neck I'm for
 it.""


 ""I don't guarantee anything,""
 said Ethaniel. ""This is what I
 was thinking of: instead of hiding
 the ship against the sun
 where there's little chance it will
 be seen, we'll make sure that
 they do see it. Let's take it
 around to the night side of the
 planet and light it up.""


 ""Say, pretty good,"" said Bal.


 ""They can't imagine that we'd
 light up an unmanned ship,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""Even if the thought
 should occur to them they'll have
 no way of checking it. Also, they
 won't be eager to harm us with
 our ship shining down on them.""


 ""That's thinking,"" said Bal,
 moving to the controls. ""I'll move
 the ship over where they can see
 it best and then I'll light it up.
 I'll really light it up.""


 ""Don't spare power.""


 ""Don't worry about that.
 They'll see it. Everybody on
 Earth will see it."" Later, with the
 ship in position, glowing against
 the darkness of space, pulsating
 with light, Bal said: ""You know,
 I feel better about this. We may
 pull it off. Lighting the ship may
 be just the help we need.""


 ""It's not we who need help, but
 the people of Earth,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""See you in five days."" With
 that he entered a small landing
 craft, which left a faintly luminescent
 trail as it plunged toward
 Earth. As soon as it was
 safe to do so, Bal left in another
 craft, heading for the other side
 of the planet.
And the spaceship circled
 Earth, unmanned, blazing and
 pulsing with light. No star in the
 winter skies of the planet below
 could equal it in brilliancy. Once
 a man-made satellite came near
 but it was dim and was lost sight
 of by the people below. During
 the day the ship was visible as
 a bright spot of light. At evening
 it seemed to burn through
 the sunset colors.


 And the ship circled on,
 bright, shining, seeming to be a
 little piece clipped from the center
 of a star and brought near
 Earth to illuminate it. Never, or
 seldom, had Earth seen anything
 like it.


 In five days the two small landing
 craft that had left it arched
 up from Earth and joined the
 orbit of the large ship. The two
 small craft slid inside the large
 one and doors closed behind
 them. In a short time the aliens
 met again.


 ""We did it,"" said Bal exultantly
 as he came in. ""I don't know
 how we did it and I thought we
 were going to fail but at the last
 minute they came through.""


 Ethaniel smiled. ""I'm tired,""
 he said, rustling.


 ""Me too, but mostly I'm cold,""
 said Bal, shivering. ""Snow.
 Nothing but snow wherever I
 went. Miserable climate. And yet
 you had me go out walking after
 that first day.""


 ""From my own experience it
 seemed to be a good idea,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""If I went out walking
 one day I noticed that the next
 day the officials were much more
 cooperative. If it worked for me
 I thought it might help you.""


 ""It did. I don't know why, but
 it did,"" said Bal. ""Anyway, this
 agreement they made isn't the
 best but I think it will keep them
 from destroying themselves.""


 ""It's as much as we can expect,""
 said Ethaniel. ""They may
 have small wars after this, but
 never the big one. In fifty or a
 hundred years we can come back
 and see how much they've
 learned.""


 ""I'm not sure I want to,"" said
 Bal. ""Say, what's an angel?""


 ""Why?""


 ""When I went out walking
 people stopped to look. Some
 knelt in the snow and called me
 an angel.""


 ""Something like that happened
 to me,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""I didn't get it but I didn't let
 it upset me,"" said Bal. ""I smiled
 at them and went about my business.""
 He shivered again. ""It was
 always cold. I walked out, but
 sometimes I flew back. I hope
 that was all right.""


 In the cabin Bal spread his
 great wings. Renaissance painters
 had never seen his like but
 knew exactly how he looked. In
 their paintings they had pictured
 him innumerable times.


 ""I don't think it hurt us that
 you flew,"" said Ethaniel. ""I did
 so myself occasionally.""


 ""But you don't know what an
 angel is?""


 ""No. I didn't have time to find
 out. Some creature of their folklore
 I suppose. You know, except
 for our wings they're very much
 like ourselves. Their legends are
 bound to resemble ours.""


 ""Sure,"" said Bal. ""Anyway,
 peace on Earth.""

49,"SECOND LANDING
By FLOYD WALLACE
A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season—an
 oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something
 that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer.
Earth
 was so far away that
 it wasn't visible. Even the
 sun was only a twinkle. But this
 vast distance did not mean that
 isolation could endure forever.
 Instruments within the ship intercepted
 radio broadcasts and,
 within the hour, early TV signals.
 Machines compiled dictionaries
 and grammars and began
 translating the major languages.
 The history of the planet was
 tabulated as facts became available.


 The course of the ship changed
 slightly; it was not much out of
 the way to swing nearer Earth.
 For days the two within the ship
 listened and watched with little
 comment. They had to decide
 soon.


 ""We've got to make or break,""
 said the first alien.


 ""You know what I'm in favor
 of,"" said the second.


 ""I can guess,"" said Ethaniel,
 who had spoken first. ""The place
 is a complete mess. They've never
 done anything except fight
 each other—and invent better
 weapons.""


 ""It's not what they've done,""
 said Bal, the second alien. ""It's
 what they're going to do, with
 that big bomb.""


 ""The more reason for stopping,""
 said Ethaniel. ""The big
 bomb can destroy them. Without
 our help they may do just that.""


 ""I may remind you that in two
 months twenty-nine days we're
 due in Willafours,"" said Bal.
 ""Without looking at the charts
 I can tell you we still have more
 than a hundred light-years to
 go.""


 ""A week,"" said Ethaniel. ""We
 can spare a week and still get
 there on time.""


 ""A week?"" said Bal. ""To settle
 their problems? They've had two
 world wars in one generation
 and that the third and final one
 is coming up you can't help feeling
 in everything they do.""


 ""It won't take much,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""The wrong diplomatic
 move, or a trigger-happy soldier
 could set it off. And it wouldn't
 have to be deliberate. A meteor
 shower could pass over and their
 clumsy instruments could interpret
 it as an all-out enemy
 attack.""


 ""Too bad,"" said Bal. ""We'll
 just have to forget there ever
 was such a planet as Earth.""


 ""Could you? Forget so many
 people?""


 ""I'm doing it,"" said Bal. ""Just
 give them a little time and they
 won't be here to remind me that
 I have a conscience.""


 ""My memory isn't convenient,""
 said Ethaniel. ""I ask you
 to look at them.""
Bal rustled, flicking the screen
 intently. ""Very much like ourselves,""
 he said at last. ""A bit
 shorter perhaps, and most certainly
 incomplete. Except for the
 one thing they lack, and that's
 quite odd, they seem exactly like
 us. Is that what you wanted me
 to say?""


 ""It is. The fact that they are
 an incomplete version of ourselves
 touches me. They actually
 seem defenseless, though I suppose
 they're not.""


 ""Tough,"" said Bal. ""Nothing
 we can do about it.""


 ""There is. We can give them
 a week.""


 ""In a week we can't negate
 their entire history. We can't
 begin to undo the effect of the
 big bomb.""


 ""You can't tell,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""We can look things over.""


 ""And then what? How much
 authority do we have?""


 ""Very little,"" conceded Ethaniel.
 ""Two minor officials on the
 way to Willafours—and we run
 directly into a problem no one
 knew existed.""


 ""And when we get to Willafours
 we'll be busy. It will be a
 long time before anyone comes
 this way again.""


 ""A very long time. There's
 nothing in this region of space
 our people want,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""And how long can Earth last?
 Ten years? Even ten months?
 The tension is building by the
 hour.""


 ""What can I say?"" said Bal.
 ""I suppose we can stop and look
 them over. We're not committing
 ourselves by looking.""


 They went much closer to
 Earth, not intending to commit
 themselves. For a day they circled
 the planet, avoiding radar
 detection, which for them was
 not difficult, testing, and sampling.
 Finally Ethaniel looked up
 from the monitor screen. ""Any
 conclusions?""


 ""What's there to think? It's
 worse than I imagined.""


 ""In what way?""


 ""Well, we knew they had the
 big bomb. Atmospheric analysis
 showed that as far away as we
 were.""


 ""I know.""


 ""We also knew they could deliver
 the big bomb, presumably
 by some sort of aircraft.""


 ""That was almost a certainty.
 They'd have no use for the big
 bomb without aircraft.""


 ""What's worse is that I now
 find they also have missiles,
 range one thousand miles and
 upward. They either have or are
 near a primitive form of space
 travel.""


 ""Bad,"" said Ethaniel. ""Sitting
 there, wondering when it's going
 to hit them. Nervousness could
 set it off.""


 ""It could, and the missiles
 make it worse,"" said Bal. ""What
 did you find out at your end?""


 ""Nothing worthwhile. I was
 looking at the people while you
 were investigating their weapons.""


 ""You must think something.""


 ""I wish I knew what to think.
 There's so little time,"" Ethaniel
 said. ""Language isn't the difficulty.
 Our machines translate
 their languages easily and I've
 taken a cram course in two or
 three of them. But that's not
 enough, looking at a few plays,
 listening to advertisements, music,
 and news bulletins. I should
 go down and live among them,
 read books, talk to scholars, work
 with them, play.""


 ""You could do that and you'd
 really get to know them. But
 that takes time—and we don't
 have it.""


 ""I realize that.""


 ""A flat yes or no,"" said Bal.


 ""No. We can't help them,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""There is nothing we
 can do for them—but we have to
 try.""


 ""Sure, I knew it before we
 started,"" said Bal. ""It's happened

 could set it off. And it wouldn't
 have to be deliberate. A meteor
 shower could pass over and their
 clumsy instruments could interpret
 it as an all-out enemy
 attack.""


 ""Too bad,"" said Bal. ""We'll
 just have to forget there ever
 was such a planet as Earth.""


 ""Could you? Forget so many
 people?""


 ""I'm doing it,"" said Bal. ""Just
 give them a little time and they
 won't be here to remind me that
 I have a conscience.""


 ""My memory isn't convenient,""
 said Ethaniel. ""I ask you
 to look at them.""
Bal rustled, flicking the screen
 intently. ""Very much like ourselves,""
 he said at last. ""A bit
 shorter perhaps, and most certainly
 incomplete. Except for the
 one thing they lack, and that's
 quite odd, they seem exactly like
 us. Is that what you wanted me
 to say?""


 ""It is. The fact that they are
 an incomplete version of ourselves
 touches me. They actually
 seem defenseless, though I suppose
 they're not.""


 ""Tough,"" said Bal. ""Nothing
 we can do about it.""


 ""There is. We can give them
 a week.""


 ""In a week we can't negate
 their entire history. We can't
 begin to undo the effect of the
 big bomb.""


 ""You can't tell,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""We can look things over.""


 ""And then what? How much
 authority do we have?""


 ""Very little,"" conceded Ethaniel.
 ""Two minor officials on the
 way to Willafours—and we run
 directly into a problem no one
 knew existed.""


 ""And when we get to Willafours
 we'll be busy. It will be a
 long time before anyone comes
 this way again.""


 ""A very long time. There's
 nothing in this region of space
 our people want,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""And how long can Earth last?
 Ten years? Even ten months?
 The tension is building by the
 hour.""


 ""What can I say?"" said Bal.
 ""I suppose we can stop and look
 them over. We're not committing
 ourselves by looking.""


 They went much closer to
 Earth, not intending to commit
 themselves. For a day they circled
 the planet, avoiding radar
 detection, which for them was
 not difficult, testing, and sampling.
 Finally Ethaniel looked up
 from the monitor screen. ""Any
 conclusions?""


 ""What's there to think? It's
 worse than I imagined.""


 ""In what way?""


 ""Well, we knew they had the
 big bomb. Atmospheric analysis
 showed that as far away as we
 were.""


 ""I know.""


 ""We also knew they could deliver
 the big bomb, presumably
 by some sort of aircraft.""


 ""That was almost a certainty.
 They'd have no use for the big
 bomb without aircraft.""


 ""What's worse is that I now
 find they also have missiles,
 range one thousand miles and
 upward. They either have or are
 near a primitive form of space
 travel.""


 ""Bad,"" said Ethaniel. ""Sitting
 there, wondering when it's going
 to hit them. Nervousness could
 set it off.""


 ""It could, and the missiles
 make it worse,"" said Bal. ""What
 did you find out at your end?""


 ""Nothing worthwhile. I was
 looking at the people while you
 were investigating their weapons.""


 ""You must think something.""


 ""I wish I knew what to think.
 There's so little time,"" Ethaniel
 said. ""Language isn't the difficulty.
 Our machines translate
 their languages easily and I've
 taken a cram course in two or
 three of them. But that's not
 enough, looking at a few plays,
 listening to advertisements, music,
 and news bulletins. I should
 go down and live among them,
 read books, talk to scholars, work
 with them, play.""


 ""You could do that and you'd
 really get to know them. But
 that takes time—and we don't
 have it.""


 ""I realize that.""


 ""A flat yes or no,"" said Bal.


 ""No. We can't help them,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""There is nothing we
 can do for them—but we have to
 try.""


 ""Sure, I knew it before we
 started,"" said Bal. ""It's happened
 before. We take the trouble to
 find out what a people are like
 and when we can't help them we
 feel bad. It's going to be that
 way again."" He rose and stretched.
 ""Well, give me an hour to
 think of some way of going at
 it.""
It was longer than that before
 they met again. In the meantime
 the ship moved much closer to
 Earth. They no longer needed instruments
 to see it. The planet
 revolved outside the visionports.
 The southern plains were green,
 coursed with rivers; the oceans
 were blue; and much of the
 northern hemisphere was glistening
 white. Ragged clouds covered
 the pole, and a dirty pall
 spread over the mid-regions of
 the north.


 ""I haven't thought of anything
 brilliant,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""Nor I,"" said Bal. ""We're going
 to have to go down there
 cold. And it will be cold.""


 ""Yes. It's their winter.""


 ""I did have an idea,"" said Bal.
 ""What about going down as supernatural
 beings?""


 ""Hardly,"" said Ethaniel. ""A
 hundred years ago it might have
 worked. Today they have satellites.
 They are not primitives.""


 ""I suppose you're right,"" said
 Bal. ""I did think we ought to
 take advantage of our physical
 differences.""


 ""If we could I'd be all for it.
 But these people are rough and
 desperate. They wouldn't be
 fooled by anything that crude.""


 ""Well, you're calling it,"" said
 Bal.


 ""All right,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""You take one side and I the
 other. We'll tell them bluntly
 what they'll have to do if they're
 going to survive, how they can
 keep their planet in one piece so
 they can live on it.""


 ""That'll go over big. Advice is
 always popular.""


 ""Can't help it. That's all we
 have time for.""


 ""Special instructions?""


 ""None. We leave the ship here
 and go down in separate landing
 craft. You can talk with me any
 time you want to through our
 communications, but don't unless
 you have to.""


 ""They can't intercept the
 beams we use.""


 ""They can't, and even if they
 did they wouldn't know what to
 do with our language. I want
 them to think that we don't
need
to talk things over.""


 ""I get it. Makes us seem better
 than we are. They think we know
 exactly what we're doing even
 though we don't.""


 ""If we're lucky they'll think
 that.""
Bal looked out of the port at
 the planet below. ""It's going to
 be cold where I'm going. You too.
 Sure we don't want to change
 our plans and land in the southern
 hemisphere? It's summer
 there.""


 ""I'm afraid not. The great
 powers are in the north. They
 are the ones we have to reach to
 do the job.""


 ""Yeah, but I was thinking of
 that holiday you mentioned.
 We'll be running straight into it.
 That won't help us any.""


 ""I know, they don't like their
 holidays interrupted. It can't be
 helped. We can't wait until it's
 over.""


 ""I'm aware of that,"" said Bal.
 ""Fill me in on that holiday, anything
 I ought to know. Probably
 religious in origin. That so?""


 ""It was religious a long time
 ago,"" said Ethaniel. ""I didn't
 learn anything exact from radio
 and TV. Now it seems to be
 chiefly a time for eating, office
 parties, and selling merchandise.""


 ""I see. It has become a business
 holiday.""


 ""That's a good description. I
 didn't get as much of it as I
 ought to have. I was busy studying
 the people, and they're hard
 to pin down.""


 ""I see. I was thinking there
 might be some way we could tie
 ourselves in with this holiday.
 Make it work for us.""


 ""If there is I haven't thought
 of it.""


 ""You ought to know. You're
 running this one."" Bal looked
 down at the planet. Clouds were
 beginning to form at the twilight
 edge. ""I hate to go down
 and leave the ship up here with
 no one in it.""


 ""They can't touch it. No matter
 how they develop in the next
 hundred years they still won't be
 able to get in or damage it in
 any way.""


 ""It's myself I'm thinking
 about. Down there, alone.""


 ""I'll be with you. On the other
 side of the Earth.""


 ""That's not very close. I'd like
 it better if there were someone
 in the ship to bring it down in a
 hurry if things get rough. They
 don't think much of each other.
 I don't imagine they'll like aliens
 any better.""


 ""They may be unfriendly,""
 Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he
 switched a monitor screen until
 he looked at the slope of a mountain.
 It was snowing and men
 were cutting small green trees in
 the snow. ""I've thought of a
 trick.""


 ""If it saves my neck I'm for
 it.""


 ""I don't guarantee anything,""
 said Ethaniel. ""This is what I
 was thinking of: instead of hiding
 the ship against the sun
 where there's little chance it will
 be seen, we'll make sure that
 they do see it. Let's take it
 around to the night side of the
 planet and light it up.""


 ""Say, pretty good,"" said Bal.


 ""They can't imagine that we'd
 light up an unmanned ship,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""Even if the thought
 should occur to them they'll have
 no way of checking it. Also, they
 won't be eager to harm us with
 our ship shining down on them.""


 ""That's thinking,"" said Bal,
 moving to the controls. ""I'll move
 the ship over where they can see
 it best and then I'll light it up.
 I'll really light it up.""


 ""Don't spare power.""


 ""Don't worry about that.
 They'll see it. Everybody on
 Earth will see it."" Later, with the
 ship in position, glowing against
 the darkness of space, pulsating
 with light, Bal said: ""You know,
 I feel better about this. We may
 pull it off. Lighting the ship may
 be just the help we need.""


 ""It's not we who need help, but
 the people of Earth,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""See you in five days."" With
 that he entered a small landing
 craft, which left a faintly luminescent
 trail as it plunged toward
 Earth. As soon as it was
 safe to do so, Bal left in another
 craft, heading for the other side
 of the planet.
And the spaceship circled
 Earth, unmanned, blazing and
 pulsing with light. No star in the
 winter skies of the planet below
 could equal it in brilliancy. Once
 a man-made satellite came near
 but it was dim and was lost sight
 of by the people below. During
 the day the ship was visible as
 a bright spot of light. At evening
 it seemed to burn through
 the sunset colors.


 And the ship circled on,
 bright, shining, seeming to be a
 little piece clipped from the center
 of a star and brought near
 Earth to illuminate it. Never, or
 seldom, had Earth seen anything
 like it.


 In five days the two small landing
 craft that had left it arched
 up from Earth and joined the
 orbit of the large ship. The two
 small craft slid inside the large
 one and doors closed behind
 them. In a short time the aliens
 met again.


 ""We did it,"" said Bal exultantly
 as he came in. ""I don't know
 how we did it and I thought we
 were going to fail but at the last
 minute they came through.""


 Ethaniel smiled. ""I'm tired,""
 he said, rustling.


 ""Me too, but mostly I'm cold,""
 said Bal, shivering. ""Snow.
 Nothing but snow wherever I
 went. Miserable climate. And yet
 you had me go out walking after
 that first day.""


 ""From my own experience it
 seemed to be a good idea,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""If I went out walking
 one day I noticed that the next
 day the officials were much more
 cooperative. If it worked for me
 I thought it might help you.""


 ""It did. I don't know why, but
 it did,"" said Bal. ""Anyway, this
 agreement they made isn't the
 best but I think it will keep them
 from destroying themselves.""


 ""It's as much as we can expect,""
 said Ethaniel. ""They may
 have small wars after this, but
 never the big one. In fifty or a
 hundred years we can come back
 and see how much they've
 learned.""


 ""I'm not sure I want to,"" said
 Bal. ""Say, what's an angel?""


 ""Why?""


 ""When I went out walking
 people stopped to look. Some
 knelt in the snow and called me
 an angel.""


 ""Something like that happened
 to me,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""I didn't get it but I didn't let
 it upset me,"" said Bal. ""I smiled
 at them and went about my business.""
 He shivered again. ""It was
 always cold. I walked out, but
 sometimes I flew back. I hope
 that was all right.""


 In the cabin Bal spread his
 great wings. Renaissance painters
 had never seen his like but
 knew exactly how he looked. In
 their paintings they had pictured
 him innumerable times.


 ""I don't think it hurt us that
 you flew,"" said Ethaniel. ""I did
 so myself occasionally.""


 ""But you don't know what an
 angel is?""


 ""No. I didn't have time to find
 out. Some creature of their folklore
 I suppose. You know, except
 for our wings they're very much
 like ourselves. Their legends are
 bound to resemble ours.""


 ""Sure,"" said Bal. ""Anyway,
 peace on Earth.""

A FILBERT IS A NUT
BY RICK RAPHAEL
That the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized
 psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!
Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.


 ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,
 but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to
 answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very
 complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.


 Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.


 Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.


 ""Atom bomb.""


 A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. ""Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I
 thought you said an 'atom bomb.'""


 ""Did,"" Funston murmured.


 Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so
 slightly. ""Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative
 thought. I'm very pleased.""


 She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.


 A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood
 up and stretched.


 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your
 things.""


 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit
 of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he
 clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and
 then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk
 back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a
 quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the
 warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.


 Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart
 book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she
 made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each
 patient.


 At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball
 and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through
 the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted
 lengthily in her chart book.


 When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked
 the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.


 The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile
 to the main administration building where her car was parked.


 As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the
 barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills
 towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant
 came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'
 mess hall.
The sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the
 ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light
 burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm
 hills.


 At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat
 up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and
 occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.
 Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that
 sheltered the deserted crafts building.


 He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark
 shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.


 An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck
 the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a
 thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild
 screams of the frightened and demented patients.


 It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling
 lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.


 Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a
 small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been
 the arts and crafts building.


 Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed
 with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried
 through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the
 explosion.


 None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a
 welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.


 The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the
 surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units
 from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the
 still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.


 Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy
 radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and
 equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.


 At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of
 Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI
 agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.


 At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast
 crater.


 In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.


 ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the
 fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of
 experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.
 ""How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?""


 ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC
 men offered timidly. ""Not over three kilotons.""


 ""I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,"" Thurgood screamed. ""How
 did it get here?""


 A military intelligence agent spoke up. ""If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be
 standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an
 atomic explosion.""


 Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.


 ""Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything
 that was in that building?"" Thurgood swept his hand in the general
 direction of the blast crater.


 ""Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,"" the hospital administrator said
 with exasperation, ""this was our manual therapy room. We gave our
 patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,
 through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems
 that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints
 and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then
 Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.""


 ""All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,""
 Thurgood sighed. ""I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this
 morning blew it to hell and gone.


 ""And I've got to find out how it happened.""


 Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little
 doctor.


 ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?""


 ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here
 now,"" the doctor snapped.
Outside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved
 around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining
 every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one
 time.


 A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the
 tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.


 She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned
 expression.


 ""He did make an atom bomb,"" she cried.


 Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped
 forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.


 At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff
 room of the hospital administration building.


 Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the
 edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist
 on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with
 every beat.


 ""It's ridiculous,"" Thurgood roared. ""We'll all be the laughingstocks of
 the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You
 are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.""


 At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the
 broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,
 strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered
 weariness.


 ""Miss Abercrombie,"" one of the physicists spoke up gently, ""you say that
 after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at
 Funston's work?""


 The therapist nodded unhappily.


 ""And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,"" the physicist
 continued, ""there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.""


 ""I'm positive that's all there was in it,"" Miss Abercrombie cried.


 There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC
 man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They
 conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.


 ""That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston
 another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.""


 Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.


 ""Are you crazy?"" he screamed. ""You want to get us all thrown into this
 filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they
 ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,
 anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with
 the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?


 ""They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!""


 At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's
 greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an
 officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small
 side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes
 later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and
 drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of
 the runway with propellers turning.


 Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to
 secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard
 the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss
 Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into
 the night skies.


 The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in
 the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack
 miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and
 military men huddled around a small wooden table.


 There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of
 modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off
 Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary
 Miss Abercrombie.


 ""Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same
 kind of clay he used before?""


 ""I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the
 hospital,"" she replied, ""and it's the same amount.""


 Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with
 Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.


 She smiled at Funston.


 ""Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,"" she said. ""These nice men have
 brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the
 one you made for me yesterday.""


 A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the
 shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he
 walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp
 clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top
 atomic scientists watched in fascination.


 His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay
 parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in
 front of him.


 Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the
 table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she
 glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston
 finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense
 silence.


 ""Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow."" She
 looked at the men and nodded her head.


 The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of
 clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him
 from the shack.


 There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The
 experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere
 and cameras clicking.


 For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay
 and photographed it from every angle.


 Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down
 range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of
 stony-faced military policemen.


 ""I told you this whole thing was asinine,"" Thurgood snarled as the
 scientific teams trooped into the bunker.


 Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open
 door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden
 cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit
 the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door
 slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.
Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space

A FILBERT IS A NUT
BY RICK RAPHAEL
That the gentleman in question was a nut was beyond question. He was an institutionalized
 psychotic. He was nutty enough to think he could make an atom bomb out of modeling clay!
Illustrated by Freas
Miss Abercrombie, the manual therapist patted the old man on the
 shoulder. ""You're doing just fine, Mr. Lieberman. Show it to me when you
 have finished.""


 The oldster in the stained convalescent suit gave her a quick, shy smile
 and went back to his aimless smearing in the finger paints.


 Miss Abercrombie smoothed her smock down over trim hips and surveyed the
 other patients working at the long tables in the hospital's arts and
 crafts shop. Two muscular and bored attendants in spotless whites,
 lounged beside the locked door and chatted idly about the Dodgers'
 prospects for the pennant.


 Through the barred windows of the workshop, rolling green hills were
 seen, their tree-studded flanks making a pleasant setting for the mental
 institution. The crafts building was a good mile away from the main
 buildings of the hospital and the hills blocked the view of the austere
 complex of buildings that housed the main wards.


 The therapist strolled down the line of tables, pausing to give a word
 of advice here, and a suggestion there.


 She stopped behind a frowning, intense patient, rapidly shaping blobs of
 clay into odd-sized strips and forms. As he finished each piece, he
 carefully placed it into a hollow shell hemisphere of clay.


 ""And what are we making today, Mr. Funston?"" Miss Abercrombie asked.


 The flying fingers continued to whip out the bits of shaped clay as the
 patient ignored the question. He hunched closer to his table as if to
 draw away from the woman.


 ""We mustn't be antisocial, Mr. Funston,"" Miss Abercrombie said lightly,
 but firmly. ""You've been coming along famously and you must remember to
 answer when someone talks to you. Now what are you making? It looks very
 complicated."" She stared professionally at the maze of clay parts.


 Thaddeus Funston continued to mold the clay bits and put them in place.


 Without looking up from his bench he muttered a reply.


 ""Atom bomb.""


 A puzzled look crossed the therapist's face. ""Pardon me, Mr. Funston. I
 thought you said an 'atom bomb.'""


 ""Did,"" Funston murmured.


 Safely behind the patient's back, Miss Abercrombie smiled ever so
 slightly. ""Why that's very good, Mr. Funston. That shows real creative
 thought. I'm very pleased.""


 She patted him on the shoulder and moved down the line of patients.


 A few minutes later, one of the attendants glanced at his watch, stood
 up and stretched.


 ""All right, fellows,"" he called out, ""time to go back. Put up your
 things.""


 There was a rustle of paint boxes and papers being shuffled and chairs
 being moved back. A tall, blond patient with a flowing mustache, put one
 more dab of paint on his canvas and stood back to survey the meaningless
 smears. He sighed happily and laid down his palette.


 At the clay table, Funston feverishly fabricated the last odd-shaped bit
 of clay and slapped it into place. With a furtive glance around him, he
 clapped the other half of the clay sphere over the filled hemisphere and
 then stood up. The patients lined up at the door, waiting for the walk
 back across the green hills to the main hospital. The attendants made a
 quick count and then unlocked the door. The group shuffled out into the
 warm, afternoon sunlight and the door closed behind them.


 Miss Abercrombie gazed around the cluttered room and picked up her chart
 book of patient progress. Moving slowly down the line of benches, she
 made short, precise notes on the day's work accomplished by each
 patient.


 At the clay table, she carefully lifted the top half of the clay ball
 and stared thoughtfully at the jumbled maze of clay strips laced through
 the lower hemisphere. She placed the lid back in place and jotted
 lengthily in her chart book.


 When she had completed her rounds, she slipped out of the smock, tucked
 the chart book under her arm and left the crafts building for the day.


 The late afternoon sun felt warm and comfortable as she walked the mile
 to the main administration building where her car was parked.


 As she drove out of the hospital grounds, Thaddeus Funston stood at the
 barred window of his locked ward and stared vacantly over the hills
 towards the craft shop. He stood there unmoving until a ward attendant
 came and took his arm an hour later to lead him off to the patients'
 mess hall.
The sun set, darkness fell over the stilled hospital grounds and the
 ward lights winked out at nine o'clock, leaving just a single light
 burning in each ward office. A quiet wind sighed over the still-warm
 hills.


 At 3:01 a.m., Thaddeus Funston stirred in his sleep and awakened. He sat
 up in bed and looked around the dark ward. The quiet breathing and
 occasional snores of thirty other sleeping patients filled the room.
 Funston turned to the window and stared out across the black hills that
 sheltered the deserted crafts building.


 He gave a quick cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 The brilliance of a hundred suns glared in the night and threw stark
 shadows on the walls of the suddenly-illuminated ward.


 An instant later, the shattering roar and blast of the explosion struck
 the hospital buildings in a wave of force and the bursting crash of a
 thousand windows was lost in the fury of the explosion and the wild
 screams of the frightened and demented patients.


 It was over in an instant, and a stunned moment later, recessed ceiling
 lights began flashing on throughout the big institution.


 Beyond the again-silent hills, a great pillar of smoke, topped by a
 small mushroom-shaped cloud, rose above the gaping hole that had been
 the arts and crafts building.


 Thaddeus Funston took his hands from his face and lay back in his bed
 with a small, secret smile on his lips. Attendants and nurses scurried
 through the hospital, seeing how many had been injured in the
 explosion.


 None had. The hills had absorbed most of the shock and apart from a
 welter of broken glass, the damage had been surprisingly slight.


 The roar and flash of the explosion had lighted and rocked the
 surrounding countryside. Soon firemen and civil defense disaster units
 from a half-dozen neighboring communities had gathered at the
 still-smoking hole that marked the site of the vanished crafts building.


 Within fifteen minutes, the disaster-trained crews had detected heavy
 radiation emanating from the crater and there was a scurry of men and
 equipment back to a safe distance, a few hundred yards away.


 At 5:30 a.m., a plane landed at a nearby airfield and a platoon of
 Atomic Energy Commission experts, military intelligence men, four FBI
 agents and an Army full colonel disembarked.


 At 5:45 a.m. a cordon was thrown around both the hospital and the blast
 crater.


 In Ward 4-C, Thaddeus Funston slept peacefully and happily.


 ""It's impossible and unbelievable,"" Colonel Thomas Thurgood said for the
 fifteenth time, later that morning, as he looked around the group of
 experts gathered in the tent erected on the hill overlooking the crater.
 ""How can an atom bomb go off in a nut house?""


 ""It apparently was a very small bomb, colonel,"" one of the haggard AEC
 men offered timidly. ""Not over three kilotons.""


 ""I don't care if it was the size of a peanut,"" Thurgood screamed. ""How
 did it get here?""


 A military intelligence agent spoke up. ""If we knew, sir, we wouldn't be
 standing around here. We don't know, but the fact remains that it WAS an
 atomic explosion.""


 Thurgood turned wearily to the small, white-haired man at his side.


 ""Let's go over it once more, Dr. Crane. Are you sure you knew everything
 that was in that building?"" Thurgood swept his hand in the general
 direction of the blast crater.


 ""Colonel, I've told you a dozen times,"" the hospital administrator said
 with exasperation, ""this was our manual therapy room. We gave our
 patients art work. It was a means of getting out of their systems,
 through the use of their hands, some of the frustrations and problems
 that led them to this hospital. They worked with oil and water paints
 and clay. If you can make an atomic bomb from vermillion pigments, then
 Madame Curie was a misguided scrubwoman.""


 ""All I know is that you say this was a crafts building. O.K. So it was,""
 Thurgood sighed. ""I also know that an atomic explosion at 3:02 this
 morning blew it to hell and gone.


 ""And I've got to find out how it happened.""


 Thurgood slumped into a field chair and gazed tiredly up at the little
 doctor.


 ""Where's that girl you said was in charge of this place?""


 ""We've already called for Miss Abercrombie and she's on her way here
 now,"" the doctor snapped.
Outside the tent, a small army of military men and AEC technicians moved
 around the perimeter of the crater, scintillators in hand, examining
 every tiny scrap that might have been a part of the building at one
 time.


 A jeep raced down the road from the hospital and drew up in front of the
 tent. An armed MP helped Miss Abercrombie from the vehicle.


 She walked to the edge of the hill and looked down with a stunned
 expression.


 ""He did make an atom bomb,"" she cried.


 Colonel Thurgood, who had snapped from his chair at her words, leaped
 forward to catch her as she collapsed in a faint.


 At 4:00 p.m., the argument was still raging in the long, narrow staff
 room of the hospital administration building.


 Colonel Thurgood, looking more like a patient every minute, sat on the
 edge of his chair at the head of a long table and pounded with his fist
 on the wooden surface, making Miss Abercrombie's chart book bounce with
 every beat.


 ""It's ridiculous,"" Thurgood roared. ""We'll all be the laughingstocks of
 the world if this ever gets out. An atomic bomb made out of clay. You
 are all nuts. You're in the right place, but count me out.""


 At his left, Miss Abercrombie cringed deeper into her chair at the
 broadside. Down both sides of the long table, psychiatrists, physicists,
 strategists and radiologists sat in various stages of nerve-shattered
 weariness.


 ""Miss Abercrombie,"" one of the physicists spoke up gently, ""you say that
 after the patients had departed the building, you looked again at
 Funston's work?""


 The therapist nodded unhappily.


 ""And you say that, to the best of your knowledge,"" the physicist
 continued, ""there was nothing inside the ball but other pieces of clay.""


 ""I'm positive that's all there was in it,"" Miss Abercrombie cried.


 There was a renewed buzz of conversation at the table and the senior AEC
 man present got heads together with the senior intelligence man. They
 conferred briefly and then the intelligence officer spoke.


 ""That seems to settle it, colonel. We've got to give this Funston
 another chance to repeat his bomb. But this time under our supervision.""


 Thurgood leaped to his feet, his face purpling.


 ""Are you crazy?"" he screamed. ""You want to get us all thrown into this
 filbert factory? Do you know what the newspapers would do to us if they
 ever got wind of the fact, that for one, tiny fraction of a second,
 anyone of us here entertained the notion that a paranoidal idiot with
 the IQ of an ape could make an atomic bomb out of kid's modeling clay?


 ""They'd crucify us, that's what they'd do!""


 At 8:30 that night, Thaddeus Funston, swathed in an Army officer's
 greatcoat that concealed the strait jacket binding him and with an
 officer's cap jammed far down over his face, was hustled out of a small
 side door of the hospital and into a waiting staff car. A few minutes
 later, the car pulled into the flying field at the nearby community and
 drove directly to the military transport plane that stood at the end of
 the runway with propellers turning.


 Two military policemen and a brace of staff psychiatrists sworn to
 secrecy under the National Atomic Secrets Act, bundled Thaddeus aboard
 the plane. They plopped him into a seat directly in front of Miss
 Abercrombie and with a roar, the plane raced down the runway and into
 the night skies.


 The plane landed the next morning at the AEC's atomic testing grounds in
 the Nevada desert and two hours later, in a small hot, wooden shack
 miles up the barren desert wastelands, a cluster of scientists and
 military men huddled around a small wooden table.


 There was nothing on the table but a bowl of water and a great lump of
 modeling clay. While the psychiatrists were taking the strait jacket off
 Thaddeus in the staff car outside, Colonel Thurgood spoke to the weary
 Miss Abercrombie.


 ""Now you're positive this is just about the same amount and the same
 kind of clay he used before?""


 ""I brought it along from the same batch we had in the store room at the
 hospital,"" she replied, ""and it's the same amount.""


 Thurgood signaled to the doctors and they entered the shack with
 Thaddeus Funston between them. The colonel nudged Miss Abercrombie.


 She smiled at Funston.


 ""Now isn't this nice, Mr. Funston,"" she said. ""These nice men have
 brought us way out here just to see you make another atom bomb like the
 one you made for me yesterday.""


 A flicker of interest lightened Thaddeus' face. He looked around the
 shack and then spotted the clay on the table. Without hesitation, he
 walked to the table and sat down. His fingers began working the damp
 clay, making first the hollow, half-round shell while the nation's top
 atomic scientists watched in fascination.


 His busy fingers flew through the clay, shaping odd, flat bits and clay
 parts that were dropped almost aimlessly into the open hemisphere in
 front of him.


 Miss Abercrombie stood at his shoulder as Thaddeus hunched over the
 table just as he had done the previous day. From time to time she
 glanced at her watch. The maze of clay strips grew and as Funston
 finished shaping the other half hemisphere of clay, she broke the tense
 silence.


 ""Time to go back now, Mr. Funston. You can work some more tomorrow."" She
 looked at the men and nodded her head.


 The two psychiatrists went to Thaddeus' side as he put the upper lid of
 clay carefully in place. Funston stood up and the doctors escorted him
 from the shack.


 There was a moment of hushed silence and then pandemonium burst. The
 experts converged on the clay ball, instruments blossoming from nowhere
 and cameras clicking.


 For two hours they studied and gently probed the mass of child's clay
 and photographed it from every angle.


 Then they left for the concrete observatory bunker, several miles down
 range where Thaddeus and the psychiatrists waited inside a ring of
 stony-faced military policemen.


 ""I told you this whole thing was asinine,"" Thurgood snarled as the
 scientific teams trooped into the bunker.


 Thaddeus Funston stared out over the heads of the MPs through the open
 door, looking uprange over the heat-shimmering desert. He gave a sudden
 cry, shut his eyes and clapped his hands over his face.


 A brilliance a hundred times brighter than the glaring Nevada sun lit
 the dim interior of the bunker and the pneumatically-operated door
 slammed shut just before the wave of the blast hit the structure.
Six hours and a jet plane trip later, Thaddeus, once again in his strait
 jacket, sat between his armed escorts in a small room in the Pentagon.
 Through the window he could see the hurried bustle of traffic over the
 Potomac and beyond, the domed roof of the Capitol.


 In the conference room next door, the joint chiefs of staff were
 closeted with a gray-faced and bone-weary Colonel Thurgood and his
 baker's dozen of AEC brains. Scraps of the hot and scornful talk drifted
 across a half-opened transom into the room where Thaddeus Funston sat in
 a neatly-tied bundle.


 In the conference room, a red-faced, four-star general cast a chilling
 glance at the rumpled figure of Colonel Thurgood.


 ""I've listened to some silly stories in my life, colonel,"" the general
 said coldly, ""but this takes the cake. You come in here with an insane
 asylum inmate in a strait jacket and you have the colossal gall to sit
 there and tell me that this poor soul has made not one, but two atomic
 devices out of modeling clay and then has detonated them.""


 The general paused.


 ""Why don't you just tell me, colonel, that he can also make spaceships
 out of sponge rubber?"" the general added bitingly.


 In the next room, Thaddeus Funston stared out over the sweeping panorama
 of the Washington landscape. He stared hard.


 In the distance, a white cloud began billowing up from the base of the
 Washington Monument, and with an ear-shattering, glass-splintering roar,
 the great shaft rose majestically from its base and vanished into space
 on a tail of flame.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting
 what she wanted.
Phil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his
 long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious
 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting
 what she wanted.
Phil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his
 long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious
 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three

 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it

 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting
 what she wanted.
Phil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his
 long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious
 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.

 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not
 theirs completely. In her fingers she held a cigarette burned down too
 far. She said, ""You look fine, Phil. You look just right."" She managed a
 smile. Then she leaned forward and crushed the cigarette in the ash
 tray on the maple coffee table and took another from the pack.


 He came to her and touched his hands to her soft blond hair, raising her
 face until she was looking into his eyes. ""You're the most beautiful
 girl I know. Did I ever tell you that?""


 ""Yes, I think so. Yes, I'm sure you did,"" she said, finishing the
 ritual; but her voice broke, and she turned her head away. Phil sat
 beside her and put his arm around her small shoulders. He had stopped
 smiling.


 ""Honey, look at me,"" he said. ""It isn't going to be bad. Honestly it
 isn't. We know exactly how it will be. If anything could go wrong, they
 wouldn't be sending me; you know that. I told you that we've sent five
 un-manned ships up and everyone came back without a hitch.""


 She turned, facing him. There were tears starting in the corners of her
 wide, brown eyes, and she brushed them away with her hand.


 ""Phil, don't go. Please don't. They can send Sammy. Sammy doesn't have a
 wife. Can't he go? They'd understand, Phil. Please!"" She was holding his
 arms tightly with her hands, and the color had drained from her cheeks.


 ""Mary, you know I can't back out now. How could I? It's been three
 years. You know how much I've wanted to be the first man to go. Nothing
 would ever be right with me again if I didn't go. Please don't make it
 hard."" He stopped talking and held her to him and stroked the back of
 her head. He could feel her shoulders shaking with quiet sobs. He
 released her and stood up.


 ""I've got to get started, Mary. Will you come to the field with me?""


 ""Yes, I'll come to say good-by."" She paused and dropped her eyes. ""Phil,
 if you go, I won't be here when you get back—if you get back. I won't
 be here because I won't be the wife of a space pilot for the rest of my
 life. It isn't the kind of life I bargained for. No matter how much I
 love you, I just couldn't take that, Phil. I'm sorry. I guess I'm not
 the noble sort of wife.""


 She finished and took another cigarette from the pack on the coffee
 table and put it to her lips. Her hand was trembling as she touched the
 lighter to the end of the cigarette and drew deeply. Phil stood watching
 her, the excitement completely gone from his eyes.


 ""I wish you had told me this a long time ago, Mary,"" Phil said. His
 voice was dry and low. ""I didn't know you felt this way about it.""


 ""Yes, you did. I told you how I felt. I told you I could never be the
 wife of a space pilot. But I don't think I ever really believed it was
 possible—not until this morning when you said tonight was the take-off.
 It's so stupid to jeopardize everything we've got for a ridiculous
 dream!""


 He sat down on the edge of the couch and took her hands between his.
 ""Mary, listen to me,"" he said. ""It isn't a dream. It's real. There's
 nothing means anything more to me than you do—you know that. But no
 man ever had the chance to do what I'm going to do tonight—no man ever.
 If I backed out now for any reason, I'd never be able to look at the sky
 again. I'd be through.""


 She looked at him without seeing him, and there was nothing at all in
 her eyes.


 ""Let's go, if you're still going,"" she finally said.
They drove through the streets of the small town with its small
 bungalows, each alike. There were no trees and very little grass. It was
 a new town, a government built town, and it had no personality yet. It
 existed only because of the huge ship standing poised in the take-off
 zone five miles away in the desert. Its future as a town rested with the
 ship, and the town seemed to feel the uncertainty of its future, seemed
 ready to stop existing as a town and to give itself back to the desert,
 if such was its destiny.


 Phil turned the car off the highway onto the rutted dirt road that led
 across the sand to the field where the ship waited. In the distance they
 could see the beams of the searchlights as they played across the
 take-off zone and swept along the top of the high wire fence stretching
 out of sight to right and left. At the gate they were stopped by the
 guard. He read Phil's pass, shined his flashlight in their faces, and
 then saluted. ""Good luck, colonel,"" he said, and shook Phil's hand.


 ""Thanks, sergeant. I'll be seeing you next week,"" Phil said, and smiled.
 They drove between the rows of wooden buildings that lined the field,
 and he parked near the low barbed fence ringing the take-off zone. He
 turned off the ignition, and sat quietly for a moment before lighting a
 cigarette. Then he looked at his wife. She was staring through the
 windshield at the rocket two hundred yards away. Its smooth polished
 surface gleamed in the spotlight glare, and it sloped up and up until
 the eye lost the tip against the stars.


 ""She's beautiful, Mary. You've never seen her before, have you?""


 ""No, I've never seen her before,"" she said. ""Hadn't you better go?"" Her
 voice was strained and she held her hands closed tightly in her lap.
 ""Please go now, Phil,"" she said.


 He leaned toward her and touched her cheek. Then she was in his arms,
 her head buried against his shoulder.


 ""Good-by, darling,"" she said.


 ""Wish me luck, Mary?"" he asked.


 ""Yes, good luck, Phil,"" she said. He opened the car door and got out.
 The noise of men and machines scurrying around the ship broke the spell
 of the rocket waiting silently for flight.


 ""Mary, I—"" he began, and then turned and strode toward the
 administration building without looking back.
Inside the building it was like a locker room before the big game. The
 tension stood alone, and each man had the same happy, excited look that
 Phil had worn earlier. When he came into the room, the noise and bustle
 stopped. They turned as one man toward him, and General Small came up to
 him and took his hand.


 ""Hello, Phil. We were beginning to think you weren't coming. You all
 set, son?""


 ""Yes, sir, I'm all set, I guess,"" Phil said.


 ""I'd like you to meet the Secretary of Defense, Phil. He's over here by
 the radar.""


 As they crossed the room, familiar faces smiled, and each man shook his
 hand or touched his arm. He saw Sammy, alone, by the coffee urn. Sammy
 waved to him, but he didn't smile. Phil wanted to talk to him, to say
 something; but there was nothing to be said now. Sammy's turn would come
 later.


 ""Mr. Secretary,"" the general said, ""this is Colonel Conover. He'll be
 the first man in history to see the other side of the Moon. Colonel—the
 Secretary of Defense.""


 ""How do you do, sir. I'm very proud to meet you,"" Phil said.


 ""On the contrary, colonel. I'm very proud to meet you. I've been looking
 at that ship out there and wondering. I almost wish I were a young man
 again. I'd like to be going. It's a thrilling thought—man's first
 adventure into the universe. You're lighting a new dawn of history,
 colonel. It's a privilege few men have ever had; and those who have had
 it didn't realize it at the time. Good luck, and God be with you.""


 ""Thank you, sir. I'm aware of all you say. It frightens me a little.""


 The general took Phil's arm and they walked to the briefing room. There
 were chairs set up for the scientists and Air Force officers directly
 connected with the take-off. They were seated now in a semicircle in
 front of a huge chart of the solar system. Phil took his seat, and the
 last minute briefing began. It was a routine he knew by heart. He had
 gone over and over it a thousand times, and he only half listened now.
 He kept thinking of Mary outside, alone by the fence.


 The voice of the briefing officer was a dull hum in his ears.


 ""... And orbit at 18,000-mph. You will then accelerate for the breakaway
 to 24,900-mph for five minutes and then free-coast for 116 hours
 until—""


 Phil asked a few questions about weather and solar conditions. And then
 the session was done. They rose and looked at each other, the same
 unanswered questions on each man's face. There were forced smiles and
 handshakes. They were ready now.


 ""Phil,"" the general said, and took him aside.


 ""Sir?""


 ""Phil, you're ... you feel all right, don't you, son?""


 ""Yes, sir. I feel fine. Why?""


 ""Phil, I've spent nearly every day with you for three years. I know you
 better than I know myself in many ways. And I've studied the
 psychologist's reports on you carefully. Maybe it's just nervousness,
 Phil, but I think there's something wrong. Is there?""


 ""No, sir. There's nothing wrong,"" Phil said, but his voice didn't carry
 conviction. He reached for a cigarette.


 ""Phil, if there is anything—anything at all—you know what it might
 mean. You've got to be in the best mental and physical condition of your
 life tonight. You know better than any man here what that means to our
 success. I think there is something more than just natural apprehension
 wrong with you. Want to tell me?""
Outside, the take-off zone crawled with men and machines at the base of
 the rocket. For ten hours, the final check-outs had been in progress;
 and now the men were checking again, on their own time. The thing they
 had worked toward for six years was ready to happen, and each one felt
 that he was sending just a little bit of himself into the sky. Beyond
 the ring of lights and moving men, on the edge of the field, Mary stood.
 Her hands moved slowly over the top of the fence, twisting the barbs of
 wire. But her eyes were on the ship.


 And then they were ready. A small group of excited men came out from the
 administration building and moved forward. The check-out crews climbed
 into their machines and drove back outside the take-off zone. And,
 alone, one man climbed the steel ladder up the side of the
 rocket—ninety feet into the air. At the top he waved to the men on the
 ground and then disappeared through a small port.


 Mary waved to him. ""Good-by,"" she said to herself, but the words stuck
 tight in her throat.


 The small group at the base of the ship turned and walked back to the
 fence. And for an eternity the great ship stood alone, waiting. Then,
 from deep inside, a rumble came, increasing in volume to a gigantic roar
 that shook the earth and tore at the ears. Slowly, the first manned
 rocket to the Moon lifted up and up to the sky.
For a long time after the rocket had become a tiny speck of light in the
 heavens, she stood holding her face in her hands and crying softly to
 herself. And then she felt the touch of a hand on her arm. She turned.


 ""Phil! Oh, Phil."" She held tightly to him and repeated his name over and
 over.


 ""They wouldn't let me go, Mary,"" he said finally. ""The general would not
 let me go.""


 She looked at him. His face was drawn tight, and there were tears on his
 cheeks. ""Thank, God,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter, darling. The only
 thing that matters is you didn't go.""


 ""You're right, Mary,"" he said. His voice was low—so low she could
 hardly hear him. ""It doesn't matter. Nothing matters now."" He stood with
 his hands at his sides, watching her. And then turned away and walked
 toward the car.

She surely got her wish ... but there was some question about getting
 what she wanted.
Phil Conover pulled the zipper of his flight suit up the front of his
 long, thin body and came into the living room. His face, usually serious
 and quietly handsome, had an alive, excited look. And the faint lines
 around his dark, deep-set eyes were accentuated when he smiled at his
 wife.


 ""All set, honey. How do I look in my monkey suit?""


 His wife was sitting stiffly on the flowered couch that was still not

 Me? Oh,
I'm A Stranger
 
Here Myself
By MACK REYNOLDS
The
 Place de France is the
 town's hub. It marks the end
 of Boulevard Pasteur, the main
 drag of the westernized part of
 the city, and the beginning of
 Rue de la Liberté, which leads
 down to the Grand Socco and
 the medina. In a three-minute
 walk from the Place de France
 you can go from an ultra-modern,
 California-like resort to the
 Baghdad of Harun al-Rashid.


 It's quite a town, Tangier.


 King-size sidewalk cafes occupy
 three of the strategic
 corners on the Place de France.
 The Cafe de Paris serves the
 best draft beer in town, gets all
 the better custom, and has three
 shoeshine boys attached to the
 establishment. You can sit of a
 sunny morning and read the
 Paris edition of the New York
Herald Tribune
while getting
 your shoes done up like mirrors
 for thirty Moroccan francs
 which comes to about five cents
 at current exchange.


 You can sit there, after the
 paper's read, sip your expresso
 and watch the people go by.


 Tangier is possibly the most
 cosmopolitan city in the world.
 In native costume you'll see
 Berber and Rif, Arab and Blue
 Man, and occasionally a Senegalese
 from further south. In
 European dress you'll see Japs
 and Chinese, Hindus and Turks,
 Levantines and Filipinos, North
 Americans and South Americans,
 and, of course, even Europeans—from
 both sides of the
 Curtain.


 In Tangier you'll find some of
 the world's poorest and some of
 the richest. The poorest will try
 to sell you anything from a
 shoeshine to their not very lily-white
 bodies, and the richest will
 avoid your eyes, afraid
you
might try to sell them something.


 In spite of recent changes, the
 town still has its unique qualities.
 As a result of them the permanent
 population includes
 smugglers and black-marketeers,
 fugitives from justice and international
 con men, espionage
 and counter-espionage agents,
 homosexuals, nymphomaniacs, alcoholics,
 drug addicts, displaced
 persons, ex-royalty, and subversives
 of every flavor. Local law
 limits the activities of few of
 these.


 Like I said, it's quite a town.
I looked up from my
Herald
 Tribune
and said, ""Hello, Paul.
 Anything new cooking?""


 He sank into the chair opposite
 me and looked around for
 the waiter. The tables were all
 crowded and since mine was a
 face he recognized, he assumed
 he was welcome to intrude. It was
 more or less standard procedure
 at the Cafe de Paris. It wasn't
 a place to go if you wanted to
 be alone.


 Paul said, ""How are you,
 Rupert? Haven't seen you for
 donkey's years.""


 The waiter came along and
 Paul ordered a glass of beer.
 Paul was an easy-going, sallow-faced
 little man. I vaguely remembered
 somebody saying he
 was from Liverpool and in
 exports.


 ""What's in the newspaper?""
 he said, disinterestedly.


 ""Pogo and Albert are going
 to fight a duel,"" I told him, ""and
 Lil Abner is becoming a rock'n'roll
 singer.""


 He grunted.


 ""Oh,"" I said, ""the intellectual
 type."" I scanned the front page.
 ""The Russkies have put up
 another manned satellite.""


 ""They have, eh? How big?""


 ""Several times bigger than
 anything we Americans have.""


 The beer came and looked
 good, so I ordered a glass too.


 Paul said, ""What ever happened
 to those poxy flying
 saucers?""


 ""What flying saucers?""


 A French girl went by with a
 poodle so finely clipped as to look
 as though it'd been shaven. The
 girl was in the latest from
 Paris. Every pore in place. We
 both looked after her.


 ""You know, what everybody
 was seeing a few years ago. It's
 too bad one of these bloody manned
 satellites wasn't up then.
 Maybe they would've seen one.""


 ""That's an idea,"" I said.


 We didn't say anything else for
 a while and I began to wonder
 if I could go back to my paper
 without rubbing him the wrong
 way. I didn't know Paul very
 well, but, for that matter, it's
 comparatively seldom you ever
 get to know anybody very well
 in Tangier. Largely, cards are
 played close to the chest.
My beer came and a plate of
 tapas for us both. Tapas at the
 Cafe de Paris are apt to be
 potato salad, a few anchovies,
 olives, and possibly some cheese.
 Free lunch, they used to call it
 in the States.


 Just to say something, I said,
 ""Where do you think they came
 from?"" And when he looked
 blank, I added, ""The Flying
 Saucers.""


 He grinned. ""From Mars or
 Venus, or someplace.""


 ""Ummmm,"" I said. ""Too bad
 none of them ever crashed, or
 landed on the Yale football field
 and said
Take me to your cheerleader
,
 or something.""


 Paul yawned and said, ""That
 was always the trouble with those
 crackpot blokes' explanations of
 them. If they were aliens from
 space, then why not show themselves?""


 I ate one of the potato chips.
 It'd been cooked in rancid olive
 oil.


 I said, ""Oh, there are various
 answers to that one. We could
 probably sit around here and
 think of two or three that made
 sense.""


 Paul was mildly interested.
 ""Like what?""


 ""Well, hell, suppose for instance
 there's this big Galactic League
 of civilized planets. But it's restricted,
 see. You're not eligible
 for membership until you, well,
 say until you've developed space
 flight. Then you're invited into
 the club. Meanwhile, they send
 secret missions down from time
 to time to keep an eye on your
 progress.""


 Paul grinned at me. ""I see you
 read the same poxy stuff I do.""


 A Moorish girl went by dressed
 in a neatly tailored gray
 jellaba, European style high-heeled
 shoes, and a pinkish silk
 veil so transparent that you
 could see she wore lipstick. Very
 provocative, dark eyes can be
 over a veil. We both looked
 after her.


 I said, ""Or, here's another
 one. Suppose you have a very
 advanced civilization on, say,
 Mars.""


 ""Not Mars. No air, and too
 bloody dry to support life.""


 ""Don't interrupt, please,"" I
 said with mock severity. ""This
 is a very old civilization and as
 the planet began to lose its
 water and air, it withdrew underground.
 Uses hydroponics and
 so forth, husbands its water and
 air. Isn't that what we'd do, in
 a few million years, if Earth lost
 its water and air?""


 ""I suppose so,"" he said. ""Anyway,
 what about them?""


 ""Well, they observe how man
 is going through a scientific
 boom, an industrial boom, a
 population boom. A boom, period.
 Any day now he's going to have
 practical space ships. Meanwhile,
 he's also got the H-Bomb and
 the way he beats the drums on
 both sides of the Curtain, he's
 not against using it, if he could
 get away with it.""


 Paul said, ""I got it. So they're
 scared and are keeping an eye on
 us. That's an old one. I've read
 that a dozen times, dished up
 different.""


 I shifted my shoulders. ""Well,
 it's one possibility.""


 ""I got a better one. How's
 this. There's this alien life form
 that's way ahead of us. Their
 civilization is so old that they
 don't have any records of when
 it began and how it was in the
 early days. They've gone beyond
 things like wars and depressions
 and revolutions, and greed for
 power or any of these things
 giving us a bad time here on
 Earth. They're all like scholars,
 get it? And some of them are
 pretty jolly well taken by Earth,
 especially the way we are right
 now, with all the problems, get
 it? Things developing so fast we
 don't know where we're going
 or how we're going to get there.""
I finished my beer and clapped
 my hands for Mouley. ""How do
 you mean,
where we're going
?""


 ""Well, take half the countries
 in the world today. They're trying
 to industrialize, modernize,
 catch up with the advanced countries.
 Look at Egypt, and Israel,
 and India and China, and Yugoslavia
 and Brazil, and all the
 rest. Trying to drag themselves
 up to the level of the advanced
 countries, and all using different
 methods of doing it. But look
 at the so-called advanced countries.
 Up to their bottoms in
 problems. Juvenile delinquents,
 climbing crime and suicide rates,
 the loony-bins full of the balmy,
 unemployed, threat of war,
 spending all their money on armaments
 instead of things like
 schools. All the bloody mess of
 it. Why, a man from Mars would
 be fascinated, like.""


 Mouley came shuffling up in
 his babouche slippers and we
 both ordered another schooner
 of beer.


 Paul said seriously, ""You
 know, there's only one big snag
 in this sort of talk. I've sorted
 the whole thing out before, and
 you always come up against this
 brick wall. Where are they, these
 observers, or scholars, or spies
 or whatever they are? Sooner
 or later we'd nab one of them.
 You know, Scotland Yard, or
 the F.B.I., or Russia's secret
 police, or the French Sûreté, or
 Interpol. This world is so deep
 in police, counter-espionage outfits
 and security agents that an
 alien would slip up in time, no
 matter how much he'd been
 trained. Sooner or later, he'd slip
 up, and they'd nab him.""


 I shook my head. ""Not necessarily.
 The first time I ever considered
 this possibility, it seemed
 to me that such an alien would
 base himself in London or New
 York. Somewhere where he could
 use the libraries for research,
 get the daily newspapers and
 the magazines. Be right in the
 center of things. But now I don't
 think so. I think he'd be right
 here in Tangier.""


 ""Why Tangier?""


 ""It's the one town in the world
 where anything goes. Nobody
 gives a damn about you or your
 affairs. For instance, I've known
 you a year or more now, and I
 haven't the slightest idea of how
 you make your living.""


 ""That's right,"" Paul admitted.
 ""In this town you seldom even
 ask a man where's he's from. He
 can be British, a White Russian,
 a Basque or a Sikh and nobody
 could care less. Where are
you
from, Rupert?""


 ""California,"" I told him.


 ""No, you're not,"" he grinned.


 I was taken aback. ""What do
 you mean?""


 ""I felt your mind probe back
 a few minutes ago when I was
 talking about Scotland Yard or
 the F.B.I. possibly flushing an
 alien. Telepathy is a sense not
 trained by the humanoids. If
 they had it, your job—and mine—would
 be considerably more
 difficult. Let's face it, in spite of
 these human bodies we're disguised
 in, neither of us is
 humanoid. Where are you really
 from, Rupert?""


 ""Aldebaran,"" I said. ""How
 about you?""


 ""Deneb,"" he told me, shaking.


 We had a laugh and ordered
 another beer.


 ""What're you doing here on
 Earth?"" I asked him.


 ""Researching for one of our
 meat trusts. We're protein
 eaters. Humanoid flesh is considered
 quite a delicacy. How
 about you?""


 ""Scouting the place for thrill
 tourists. My job is to go around
 to these backward cultures and
 help stir up inter-tribal, or international,
 conflicts—all according
 to how advanced they
 are. Then our tourists come in—well
 shielded, of course—and get
 their kicks watching it.""


 Paul frowned. ""That sort of
 practice could spoil an awful
 lot of good meat.""

53,"STAR MOTHER
By ROBERT F. YOUNG
A touching story of the most
 enduring love in all eternity.
That
 night her son was the
 first star.


 She stood motionless in the
 garden, one hand pressed against
 her heart, watching him rise
 above the fields where he had
 played as a boy, where he had
 worked as a young man; and she
 wondered whether he was thinking
 of those fields now, whether
 he was thinking of her standing
 alone in the April night with her
 memories; whether he was
 thinking of the verandahed
 house behind her, with its empty
 rooms and silent halls, that once
 upon a time had been his birthplace.


 Higher still and higher he
 rose in the southern sky, and
 then, when he had reached his
 zenith, he dropped swiftly down
 past the dark edge of the Earth
 and disappeared from sight. A
 boy grown up too soon, riding
 round and round the world on
 a celestial carousel, encased in
 an airtight metal capsule in an
 airtight metal chariot ...
Why don't they leave the stars
 alone?
she thought.
Why don't
 they leave the stars to God?
The general's second telegram
 came early the next morning:
 Explorer XII
doing splendidly.
 Expect to bring your son down
 sometime tomorrow
.


 She went about her work as
 usual, collecting the eggs and
 allocating them in their cardboard
 boxes, then setting off in
 the station wagon on her Tuesday
 morning run. She had expected
 a deluge of questions
 from her customers. She was not
 disappointed. ""Is Terry really
 way up there all alone, Martha?""
 ""Aren't you
scared
, Martha?"" ""I
 do hope they can get him back
 down all right, Martha."" She
 supposed it must have given
 them quite a turn to have their
 egg woman change into a star
 mother overnight.


 She hadn't expected the TV interview,
 though, and she would
 have avoided it if it had been
 politely possible. But what could
 she do when the line of cars and
 trucks pulled into the drive and
 the technicians got out and started
 setting up their equipment in
 the backyard? What could she
 say when the suave young man
 came up to her and said, ""We
 want you to know that we're all
 very proud of your boy up there,
 ma'am, and we hope you'll do us
 the honor of answering a few
 questions.""


 Most of the questions concerned
 Terry, as was fitting.
 From the way the suave young
 man asked them, though, she got
 the impression that he was trying
 to prove that her son was
 just like any other average
 American boy, and such just
 didn't happen to be the case. But
 whenever she opened her mouth
 to mention, say, how he used to
 study till all hours of the night,
 or how difficult it had been for
 him to make friends because of
 his shyness, or the fact that he
 had never gone out for football—whenever
 she started to mention
 any of these things, the
 suave young man was in great
 haste to interrupt her and to
 twist her words, by requestioning,
 into a different meaning
 altogether, till Terry's behavior
 pattern seemed to coincide with
 the behavior pattern which the
 suave young man apparently considered
 the norm, but which, if
 followed, Martha was sure,
 would produce not young men
 bent on exploring space but
 young men bent on exploring
 trivia.


 A few of the questions concerned
 herself: Was Terry her
 only child? (""Yes."") What had
 happened to her husband? (""He
 was killed in the Korean War."")
 What did she think of the new
 law granting star mothers top
 priority on any and all information
 relating to their sons? (""I
 think it's a fine law ... It's too
 bad they couldn't have shown
 similar humanity toward the
 war mothers of World War II."")
It was late in the afternoon
 by the time the TV crew got
 everything repacked into their
 cars and trucks and made their
 departure. Martha fixed herself
 a light supper, then donned an
 old suede jacket of Terry's and
 went out into the garden to wait
 for the sun to go down. According
 to the time table the general
 had outlined in his first telegram,
 Terry's first Tuesday
 night passage wasn't due to occur
 till 9:05. But it seemed only
 right that she should be outside
 when the stars started to come
 out. Presently they did, and she
 watched them wink on, one by
 one, in the deepening darkness
 of the sky. She'd never been
 much of a one for the stars;
 most of her life she'd been much
 too busy on Earth to bother with
 things celestial. She could remember,
 when she was much
 younger and Bill was courting
 her, looking up at the moon
 sometimes; and once in a while,
 when a star fell, making a wish.
 But this was different. It was
 different because now she had
 a personal interest in the sky, a
 new affinity with its myriad inhabitants.


 And how bright they became
 when you kept looking at them!
 They seemed to come alive, almost,
 pulsing brilliantly down
 out of the blackness of the night ...
 And they were different colors,
 too, she noticed with a start.
 Some of them were blue and
 some were red, others were yellow
 ... green ... orange ...


 It grew cold in the April garden
 and she could see her breath.
 There was a strange crispness,
 a strange clarity about the
 night, that she had never known
 before ... She glanced at her
 watch, was astonished to see that
 the hands indicated two minutes
 after nine. Where had the time
 gone? Tremulously she faced the
 southern horizon ... and saw
 her Terry appear in his shining
 chariot, riding up the star-pebbled
 path of his orbit, a star in
 his own right, dropping swiftly
 now, down, down, and out of
 sight beyond the dark wheeling
 mass of the Earth ... She took
 a deep, proud breath, realized
 that she was wildly waving her
 hand and let it fall slowly to her
 side. Make a wish! she thought,
 like a little girl, and she wished
 him pleasant dreams and a safe
 return and wrapped the wish in
 all her love and cast it starward.
Sometime tomorrow, the general's
 telegram had said—


 That meant sometime today!


 She rose with the sun and fed
 the chickens, fixed and ate her
 breakfast, collected the eggs and
 put them in their cardboard
 boxes, then started out on her
 Wednesday morning run. ""My
 land, Martha, I don't see how
 you stand it with him way up
 there! Doesn't it get on your
nerves
?"" (""Yes ... Yes, it
 does."") ""Martha, when are they
 bringing him back down?""
 (""Today ...
Today
!"") ""It must
 be wonderful being a star mother,
 Martha."" (""Yes, it is—in a
 way."")


 Wonderful ... and terrible.


 If only he can last it out for
 a few more hours, she thought.
 If only they can bring him down
 safe and sound. Then the vigil
 will be over, and some other
 mother can take over the awesome
 responsibility of having a
 son become a star—


 If only ...
The general's third telegram
 arrived that afternoon:
Regret
 to inform you that meteorite impact
 on satellite hull severely
 damaged capsule-detachment
 mechanism, making ejection impossible.
 Will make every effort
 to find another means of accomplishing
 your son's return.
Terry!—


 See the little boy playing beneath
 the maple tree, moving his
 tiny cars up and down the tiny
 streets of his make-believe village;
 the little boy, his fuzz of
 hair gold in the sunlight, his
 cherub-cheeks pink in the summer
 wind—
Terry!—
Up the lane the blue-denimed
 young man walks, swinging his
 thin tanned arms, his long legs
 making near-grownup strides
 over the sun-seared grass; the
 sky blue and bright behind him,
 the song of cicada rising and
 falling in the hazy September
 air—
Terry ...
—probably won't get a chance
 to write you again before take-off,
 but don't worry, Ma. The
Explorer XII
is the greatest bird
 they ever built. Nothing short of
 a direct meteorite hit can hurt
 it, and the odds are a million to
 one ...
Why don't they leave the stars
 alone? Why don't they leave the
 stars to God?
The afternoon shadows lengthened
 on the lawn and the sun
 grew red and swollen over the
 western hills. Martha fixed supper,
 tried to eat, and couldn't.
 After a while, when the light
 began to fade, she slipped into
 Terry's jacket and went outside.


 Slowly the sky darkened and
 the stars began to appear. At
 length
her
star appeared, but its
 swift passage blurred before her
 eyes. Tires crunched on the
 gravel then, and headlights
 washed the darkness from the
 drive. A car door slammed.


 Martha did not move.
Please
 God
, she thought,
let it be Terry
,
 even though she knew that it
 couldn't possibly be Terry. Footsteps
 sounded behind her, paused.
 Someone coughed softly. She
 turned then—


 ""Good evening, ma'am.""


 She saw the circlet of stars
 on the gray epaulet; she saw the
 stern handsome face; she saw
 the dark tired eyes. And she
 knew. Even before he spoke
 again, she knew—


 ""The same meteorite that
 damaged the ejection mechanism,
 ma'am. It penetrated the
 capsule, too. We didn't find out
 till just a while ago—but there
 was nothing we could have done
 anyway ... Are you all right,
 ma'am?""


 ""Yes. I'm all right.""


 ""I wanted to express my regrets
 personally. I know how you
 must feel.""


 ""It's all right.""


 ""We will, of course, make
 every effort to bring back his ... remains ... so
 that he can
 have a fitting burial on Earth.""


 ""No,"" she said.


 ""I beg your pardon, ma'am?""


 She raised her eyes to the
 patch of sky where her son had
 passed in his shining metal sarcophagus.
 Sirius blossomed
 there, blue-white and beautiful.
 She raised her eyes still higher—and
 beheld the vast parterre
 of Orion with its central motif
 of vivid forget-me-nots, its far-flung
 blooms of Betelguese and
 Rigel, of Bellatrix and Saiph ...
 And higher yet—and there
 flamed the exquisite flower beds
 of Taurus and Gemini, there
 burgeoned the riotous wreath of
 the Crab; there lay the pulsing
 petals of the Pleiades ... And
 down the ecliptic garden path,
 wafted by a stellar breeze, drifted
 the ocher rose of Mars ...


 ""No,"" she said again.


 The general had raised his
 eyes, too; now, slowly, he lowered
 them. ""I think I understand,
 ma'am. And I'm glad
 that's the way you want it ...
 The stars
are
beautiful tonight,
 aren't they.""


 ""More beautiful than they've
 ever been,"" she said.
After the general had gone,
 she looked up once more at the
 vast and variegated garden of
 the sky where her son lay buried,
 then she turned and walked
 slowly back to the memoried
 house.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's

 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.

 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""

 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

55,"Face value
When the BBC broadcast the recent documentary by Louis Theroux that looked back at the time he spent in the company of Jimmy Savile, there was disbelief across social media that no one had stepped in to stop Savile from committing his crimes. Some blamed the BBC, some blamed those in Savile's immediate circle, but others blamed a simple error of human judgment.  

 ""He literally couldn't look more like a paedophile,"" read one post – one of many to state a supposedly incontrovertible truth: that Savile's criminal tendencies could have been detected from the shape of his features, his eyes, his hair. Moreover, this has nothing to do with the benefit of hindsight and should have been picked up at the time. His looks, they suggested, were a moral indicator, with a wealth of compelling visual evidence to support the claim. 

 We know that paedophiles, murderers and other violent criminals come in many shapes and sizes. If we knew nothing about their criminal history, some of their photos might even appear attractive. But the idea that someone's features betray their character is something rooted deep within us; it's the reason why certain photos perform well on dating apps, or why trustworthy-looking politicians might rack up votes. But how wrong are our hunches of perceived criminality?  

 A recent paper, published by Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang of Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, claims to be the first to use machine learning and neural networks to attempt a fully automated inference of criminality from facial images, removing prejudice from the equation and testing the validity of our gut feelings. ""What facial features influence the average Joe's impulsive and yet consensual judgments on social attributes?"" they ask. Through a study of 1,856 images (""controlled for race, gender, age and facial expression"") they claim to have established the validity of ""automated, face-induced inference on criminality, despite the historical controversy surrounding this line of enquiry.""  

 In other words, they believe that they've found a relationship between looking like a criminal and actually being one. 

 It's a claim that's been made many times over the years. Physiognomy, the 'science' of judging people by their appearance, was first theorised by the ancient Greeks in around the 5th century BC. Aristotle's pronouncement that ""it is possible to infer character from features"" led to a number of works relating to 'Physiognomica', a word derived from
physis
(nature),
nomos
(law) and (or)
gnomon
(judge or interpreter).  

 All of Greek society, it was claimed, could benefit from this skill: it could assist with choosing an employee, a slave or a spouse, while its inherent vagueness made it intriguing to philosophers and useful for scientists who bent the theories to support their own beliefs. It became a recognised science in the Islamic world, and was used and taught in Europe throughout late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, despite nagging doubts among thinkers and physicians of the day. In the early 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci claimed not to ""concern myself with false physiognomy, because these chimeras have no scientific foundation."" 

 Theories of physiognomy, however, would persist beyond the Renaissance. In 1586, Italian scholar Giambattista della Porta published a book, De humana physiognomonia libri IIII, which established him as the 'father of Physiognomy'. Della Porta's thinking was based on the 'doctrine of signatures'; the idea that the appearance of plants and animals offers clues to their nature. For example, as one writer of the time suggested, walnuts are good for curing headaches because they're shaped a bit like a human head. The theories in della Porta's book were supported by dozens of detailed illustrations which, by comparing human faces to those of animals, suggested that they must surely share similar character traits.
In the 17th century, Swiss poet Johann Caspar Lavater took della Porta's methodology and ran with it, commissioning artists to illustrate his popular Essays On Physiognomy – which, to the chagrin of his contemporary, the writer Hannah More, sold for ""fifteen guineas a set… while in vain we boast that philosophy [has] broken down all the strongholds of prejudice, ignorance, and superstition."" 

 Lavater's work was criticised for being ridden with bias (black faces rarely emerged well from his analyses) but he was right in one respect: ""Whether they are or are not sensible of it,"" he wrote, ""all men are daily influenced by physiognomy."" 

 Many studies have been done into our psychological response to faces, and it's clear that a so-called halo effect will inevitably work its magic. ""Attractive people are regarded as better at everything,"" says Professor Peter Hancock, lecturer in Psychology at Stirling University. ""And we can't shake that off because there's some truth to it. Good genes produce intelligent people, attractive faces, fit bodies, and we imagine that they're going to be good at everything else, too. We don't have good insight into our own behaviour. We tend to think we understand what we're doing, but we don't."" 

 Hancock describes attending a conference where one speaker showed a series of black faces and white faces to students (who were mostly white) and asked them what they thought the experiment was about. ""They knew that he was trying to assess whether they would rate the black ones as more criminal,"" says Hancock. ""But then they did!"" 

 We attribute social characteristics based on opinions we already hold about certain kinds of faces: whether they look unusual in some way, whether they resemble a partner, a family member or even ourselves, or perhaps have some other cultural association. Physiognomy ultimately stems from what Alexander Todorov, professor of psychology at Princeton University, calls an 'overgeneralisation hypothesis'. ""People,"" he wrote, ""use easily accessible facial information (eg an expression such as a smile, cues to gender and ethnic group) to make social attributions congruent with this information (eg a nice person)."" 

 In a social media age, the pictures we choose to represent ourselves online are a form of self-presentation driven by those social attributions and the knowledge that our pictures are being judged.  

 Experiments at Princeton found that we take less than one tenth of a second to form an opinion of strangers from their pictures, and those opinions tend to stand firm even if we're exposed to those pictures for a longer period of time. That tendency to judge instantly gives rise to a number of selfie tropes that are deemed to elicit positive responses, particularly when it comes to photos on dating profiles: certain angles, particular expressions, minute adjustments of eyebrows and lips that might appear to be about narcissism and vanity, but are more about a fear of being incorrectly assessed. After all, false suppositions based on people's faces are hugely influential within society, and in extreme cases they can have a huge impact on people's lives.  

 When retired teacher Christopher Jefferies was held by police in connection with the murder of Joanna Yeates in Bristol back in 2010, more than half a dozen newspapers gave his unusual appearance particular scrutiny and made assumptions accordingly, which in turn influenced public opinion. This culminated in substantial damages for defamation, two convictions for contempt of court and a painful ordeal for Jefferies, who was entirely innocent. 

 This kind of deep-seated bias looms large throughout physiognomic works of the 19th and 20th centuries, from absurdities such as Vaught's Practical Character Reader of 1902 (handy if you want to find out what a ""deceitful chin"" looks like) to more inherently troubling volumes such as Cesare Lombroso's Criminal Man.  

 After performing a number of autopsies on criminals, the Italian physician claimed to have discovered a number of common characteristics, and it's worth listing them if only to establish the supposed criminality of pretty much everyone you know:
Unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances on head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos; receding hairline; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.
In a woeful misreading of Darwinian theory, Lombroso unwittingly founded the field of anthropological criminology, and more specifically the idea of the born criminal: a hereditary quality that posed a danger to society and must be rooted out. His theories became discredited during the 20th century, but the kind of bias displayed by Lombroso can still be found in legal systems across the world; studies show that people with stereotypically 'untrustworthy' faces tend to receive harsher treatment than those who don't. There's evidently some consensus over people's attitudes toward certain faces, but it doesn't follow that the consensus is correct. 

 The only attributes that we're reasonably good at detecting, according to research done at the University of Michigan in the 1960s and later tested at the University of Stirling in 2007, are extroversion and conscientiousness. For other traits there's insufficient evidence that our hunches are correct, with anomalies explained by our evolved aversion to 'ugliness', established links between broader faces and powerful physiques, or cultural associations with certain demographics which are reinforced with nagging regularity by newspapers, books, television and film. 

 Data-driven studies, based upon huge quantities of facial data, would seem to offer the final word on this. Since 2005, computational models have used various techniques to test for links between social attributes and facial features, resulting in suggestions that our faces can betray, for example, political leanings, sexual orientation and criminality. One BBC Future article from 2015 even describes the 'discipline' of physiognomy as 'gaining credibility'. But Todorov details many problems with these studies, pointing out the challenging nature of doing such experiments with sufficient rigour – not least because different images of the same people can prompt wildly differing results.  

 The aforementioned study at Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, with its enthusiastic, data-driven analyses of such questions as ""What features of a human face betray its owner's propensity for crimes?"" prompted a wave of press coverage.
The vision outlined in these articles is of an unethical dystopia where neural networks can assess our faces and establish a likely score for criminality – but Todorov is scathing about this paper, too. ""The main problem is the sampling of the images,"" he says. ""There is not enough information about the [nature of] the images of the people who were convicted. Second, clearly, there are huge differences between the two samples [of convicts and non-convicts] [in terms of] education and socio-economic status.""
In other words, your appearance is affected by the kind of life you've led, so the classifiers within the computer program are simply distinguishing between different demographics rather than detecting a propensity for criminal behaviour. 

 Todorov is also wary of these classifiers misidentifying more 'innocent' people than identifying actual criminals, and accuracy is a concern shared by Peter Hancock. ""Networks don't assess faces in the same way that we do,"" he says. ""One of our systems, which is a deep network, has a recognition engine which generates an ordered list of how similar various faces are. And sometimes you get good matches – but other times you look at them and say, well, it's the wrong race! To humans they look completely different. And that underlines the fact that the networks are working in a different sort of way, and actually you don't really know how they're working. They're the ultimate black box."" 

 This isn't to say that the use of big data, and particularly the use of composite imagery (digitally blending together certain types of faces) doesn't give us useful information and fascinating correlations. ""You can, for example, take a given face and use computer software to make it look more or less trustworthy,"" says Hancock. ""I remember a colleague playing with this and he made a less trustworthy version of George W Bush – and how shifty did he look! I'm surprised that they're not using these techniques in political advertising, because you couldn't tell that anything had been done [to the picture], but when you look at it you think 'I wouldn't trust him'."" 

 The revitalisation of the theory of physiognomy by the Shanghai students is, according to Todorov, deeply problematic on a theoretical level. ""Are we back to Lombroso's theory,"" he asks, ""that criminals were anomalous creatures, evolutionary degenerates? How does one become criminal, and what role do various life forces play into this? There are people making claims that you just need to look at the face to predict personality and behaviour, but many of these people have not given much thought to their underlying assumptions.""  

 While it's true that we judge books by their covers, covers are more than just faces; we piece together all kinds of cues from people to form our impressions of them. Jimmy Savile's appearance was unusual by any standards, but we absorbed a great deal of information about him over the years that will have influenced our opinions – not least from the original Louis Theroux programme from 2000 that was reexamined in that recent BBC documentary. Savile's vague resemblance to the Child Catcher from the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is convenient but ultimately misleading, and the way it reinforces the idea of what a paedophile might 'look like' is unfortunate; not least because it helps to sustain a low-level belief in the 'science' of physiognomy, despite its tendency to crumble under the slightest cross examination.

56,"AI: what's the worst that could happen?
The Centre for the Future of Intelligence is seeking to investigate the implications of artificial intelligence for humanity, and make sure humans take advantage of the opportunities while dodging the risks. It launched at the University of Cambridge last October, and is a collaboration between four universities and colleges – Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial and Berkeley – backed with a 10-year, £10m grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

 Because no single discipline is ideally suited to this task, the centre emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It is bringing together a diverse community of some of the world's best researchers, philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists. 

Executive director of the centre is Stephen Cave, a writer, philosopher and former diplomat. Harry Armstrong, head of futures at Nesta, which publishes The Long + Short, spoke with Cave about the impact of AI. 

 Their conversation has been edited.
Harry  Armstrong: Do you see the interdisciplinary nature of the centre as one of its key values and one of the key impacts you hope it will have on the field?
Stephen Cave: Thinking about the impact of AI is not something that any one discipline owns or does in any very systematic way. So if academia is going to rise to the challenge and provide thought leadership on this hugely important issue, then we’re going to need to do it by breaking down current disciplinary boundaries and bringing people with very different expertise together.  

 That means bringing together the technologists and the experts at developing these algorithms together with social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and so forth.  

 I think there are many areas of science where more interdisciplinary engagement would be valuable. Biotech’s another example. In that sense AI isn’t unique, but I think because thinking about AI is still in very early stages, we have an opportunity to shape the way in which we think about it, and build that community. 

 We want to create a space where many different disciplines can come together and develop a shared language, learn from each other’s approaches, and hopefully very quickly move to be able to actually develop new ideas, new conclusions, together. But the first step is learning how to talk to each other.
At a recent talk, Naomi Klein said that addressing the challenge of climate change could not have come at a worse time. The current dominant political and economic ideologies, along with growing isolationist sentiment, runs contrary to the bipartisan, collaborative approaches needed to solve global issues like climate change. Do you see the same issues hampering a global effort to respond to the challenges AI raises?
Climate change suffers from the problem that the costs are not incurred in any direct way by the industrialists who own the technology and are profiting from it. With AI, that has been the case so far; although not on the same scale. There has been disruption but so far, compared to industrialisation, the impact has been fairly small. That will probably change. 

 AI companies, and in particular the big tech companies, are very concerned that this won't go like climate change, but rather it will go like GMOs: that people will have a gut reaction to this technology as soon as the first great swathe of job losses take hold. People speculate that 50m jobs could be lost in the US if trucking is automated, which is conceivable within 10 years. You could imagine a populist US government therefore simply banning driverless cars. 

 So I think there is anxiety in the tech industry that there could be a serious reaction against this technology at any point. And so my impression is that there is a feeling within these companies that these ethical and social implications need to be taken very seriously, now. And that a broad buy-in by society into some kind of vision of the future in which this technology plays a role is required, if a dangerous – or to them dangerous – counteraction is to be avoided.
My personal experience working with these tech companies is that they are concerned for their businesses and genuinely want to do the right thing. Of course there are intellectual challenges and there is money to be made, but equally they are people who don't think when they get up in the morning that they're going to put people out of jobs or bring about the downfall of humanity. As the industry matures it's developing a sense of responsibility. 

 So I think we've got a real opportunity, despite the general climate, and in some ways because of it. There's a great opportunity to bring industry on board to make sure the technology is developed in the right way.
One of the dominant narratives around not only AI but technology and automation more generally is that we, as humans, are at the mercy of technological progress. If you try and push against this idea you can be labelled as being anti-progress and stuck in the past. But we do have a lot more control than we give ourselves credit for. For example, routineness and susceptibility to automation are not inevitable features of occupations, job design is hugely important. How do we design jobs? How do we create jobs that allow people to do the kind of work they want to do? There can be a bit of a conflict between being impacted by what's happening and having some sort of control over what we want to happen.
Certainly, we encounter technological determinism a lot. And it's understandable. For us as individuals, of course it does feel like it always is happening and we just have to cope. No one individual can do much about it, other than adapt. 

 But that's different when we consider ourselves at a level of a society, as a polis [city state], or as an international community. I think we can shape the way in which technology develops. We have various tools. In any given country, we have regulations. There's a possibility of international regulation. 

 Technology is emerging from a certain legal, political, normative, cultural, and social framework. It's coming from a certain place. And it is shaped by all of those things. 

 And I think the more we understand a technology's relationship with those things, and the more we then consciously try to shape those things, the more we are going to influence the technology. So, for example, developing a culture of responsible innovation. For example, a kind of Hippocratic oath for AI developers. These things are within the realms of what is feasible, and I think will help to shape the future.
One of the problems with intervention, generally, is that we cannot control the course of events. We can attempt to, but we don't know how things are going to evolve. The reality is, societies are much too complex for us to be able to shape them in any very specific way, as plenty of ideologies and political movements have found to their cost. There are often unforeseen consequences that can derail a project. 

 I think, nonetheless, there are things we can do. We can try to imagine how things might go very badly wrong, and then work hard to develop systems that will stop that from happening. We can also try collectively to imagine how things could go very right. The kind of society that we actually want to live in that uses this technology. And I'm sure that will be skewed in all sorts of ways, and we might imagine things that seem wonderful and actually have terrible by-products. 

 This conversation cannot be in the hands of any one group. It oughtn't be in the hands of Silicon Valley billionaires alone. They've got their role to play, but this is a conversation we need to be having as widely as possible.
The centre is developing some really interesting projects but perhaps one of the most interesting is the discussion of what intelligence might be. Could you go into a bit more detail about the kinds of questions you are trying to explore in this area?
You mean kinds of intelligence?
Yeah.
I think this is very important because historically, we've had an overwhelming tendency to anthropomorphise. We define what intelligence is, historically, as being human-like. And then within that, being like certain humans. 

 And it's taken a very long time for the academic community to accept that there could be such a thing as non-human intelligence at all. We know that crows, for example, who have had a completely different evolutionary history, or octopuses, who have an even more different evolutionary history, might have a kind of intelligence that's very different to ours. That in some ways rivals our own, and so forth. 

 But luckily, we have got to that point in recent years of accepting that we are not the only form of intelligence. But now, AI is challenging that from a different direction. Just as we are accepting that the natural world offers this enormous range of different intelligences, we are at the same time inventing new intelligences that are radically different to humans. 

 And I think, still, this anthropomorphic picture of the kind of humanoid android, the robot, dominates our idea of what AI is too much. And too many people, and the industry as well, talk about human-level artificial intelligence as a goal, or general AI, which basically means like a human. But actually what we're building is nothing like a human. 

 When the first pocket calculator was made, it didn't do maths like a human. It was vastly better. It didn't make the occasional mistake. When we set about creating these artificial agents to solve these problems, because they have a completely different evolutionary history to humans, they solve problems in very different ways.
And until now, people have been fairly shy about describing them as intelligent. Or rather, in the history of AIs, we think solving a particular problem would require intelligence. Then we solve it. And then that's no longer intelligence, because we've solved it. Chess is a good example. 

 But the reality is, we are creating a whole new world of different artificial agents. And we need to understand that world. We need to understand all the different ways of being clever, if you like. How you can be extremely sophisticated at some particular rational process, and yet extremely bad at another one in a way that bears no relation to the way humans are on these axes. 

 And this is important, partly because we need to expand our sense of what is intelligent, like we have done with the natural world. Because lots of things follow from saying something is intelligent. Historically, we have a long tradition in Western philosophy of saying those who are intelligent should rule. So if intelligence equates to power, then obviously we need to think about what we mean by intelligence. Who has it and who doesn't. Or how it equates to rights and responsibilities. 

 It certainly is a very ambitious project to create the atlas of intelligence.
There was a point I read in something you wrote on our ideas of intelligence that I thought was very interesting. We actually tend to think of intelligence at the societal level when we think about human ability, rather than at the individual level but in the end conflate the two. I think that's a very good point, when we think about our capabilities, we think about what we can achieve as a whole, not individually. But when we talk about AI, we tend to think about that individual piece of technology, or that individual system. So for example if we think about the internet of things and AI, we should discuss intelligence as something encompassed by the whole.
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, right now, perhaps it is a product of our anthropomorphising bias. But there is a tendency to see a narrative of AI versus humanity, as if it's one or the other. And yet, obviously, there are risks in this technology long before it acquires any kind of manipulative agency. 

 Robotic technology is dangerous. Or potentially dangerous. But at the same time, most of what we're using technology for is to enhance ourselves, to increase our capacities. And a lot of what AI is going to be doing is augmenting us – we're going to be working as teams, AI-human teams.
Where do you think this AI-human conflict, or concept of a conflict, comes from? Do you think that's just a reflection of historical conversations we've had about automation, or do you think it is a deeper fear?
I do think it comes both from some biases that might well be innate, such as anthropomorphism, or our human tendency to ascribe agency to other objects, particularly moving ones, is well-established and probably has sound evolutionary roots. If it moves, it's probably wise to start asking yourself questions like, ""What is it? What might it want? Where might it be going? Might it be hungry? Do I look like food to it?"" I think it makes sense, it's natural for us to think in terms of agency. And when we do, it's natural for us to project our own ways of being and acting. And we, as primates, are profoundly co-operative. 

 But at the same time, we're competitive and murderous. We have a strong sense of in-group versus out-group, which is responsible for both a great deal of cooperation, within the in-group, but also terrible crimes. Murder, rape, pillage, genocide; and they're pointed at the out-group. 

 And so I think it's very natural for us to see AIs in terms of agents. We anthropomorphise them as these kind of android robots. And then we think about, well, you know, are they part of our in-group, or are they some other group? If they're some other group, it's us against them. Who's going to win? Well, let's see. So I think that's very natural, I think that's very human.
There is this long tradition, in Western culture in particular, with associating intelligence and dominance and power. It's interesting to speculate about how, and I wish I knew more about it, and I'd like to see more research on this, about how different cultures perceive AI. It's well known that Japan is very accepting of technology and robots, for example. 

 You can think, well, we in the West have long been justifying power relations of a certain kind on the basis that we're 'cleverer'. That's why men get to vote and women don't, or whatever. In a culture where power is not based on intelligence but, say, on a caste system, which is purely hereditary, we’d build an AI, and it would just tune in, drop out, attain enlightenment, just sit in the corner. Or we beg it to come back and help us find enlightenment. It might be that we find a completely different narrative to the one that's dominant in the West.
One of the projects the centre is running is looking into what kind of AI breakthroughs may come, when and what the social consequences could be. What do you think the future holds? What are your fears – what do you think could go right and wrong in the short, medium and long term?
That's a big question. Certainly I don't lie awake at night worried that robots are going to knock the door down and come in with a machine gun. If the robots take over the world, it won't be by knocking the door down. At the moment, I think it's certainly as big a risk that we have a GMO moment, and there's a powerful reaction against the technology which prevents us from reaping the benefits, which are enormous. I think that's as big a risk as the risks from the technologies themselves. 

 I think one worry that we haven't talked about is that we've become extremely dependent  upon this technology. And that we essentially become deskilled. There's an extent to which the history of civilisation is the history of the domestication of the human species sort of by ourselves, and also by our technology, to some extent. And AI certainly allows for that to reach a whole new level. 

 Just think about GPs with diagnostic tools. Even now, my GP consults the computer fairly regularly. But as diagnostic tools get better, what are they going to be doing other than just typing something into the computer and reading out what comes back? At which point, you might as well do away with the GP. But then, who does know about medicine? 

 And so we do need to worry about deskilling and about becoming dependent. And it is entirely possible that you can imagine a society in which we're all sort of prosperous, in a sense. Our basic bodily needs are provided for, perhaps, in a way, to an extent that we've never before even dreamed of. Unprecedented in human history. 

 And yet, we're stripped of any kind of meaningful work. We have no purpose. We're escaping to virtual reality. And then you could imagine all sorts of worrying countercultures or Luddite movements or what have you. I guess that's the kind of scenario that – I haven't sketched it terribly well – but that's the kind of thing that worries me more than missile-toting giant robots. 

 As to utopian, yes, that's interesting. I certainly mentioned a couple of things. One thing that I hope is that this new technological revolution enables us to undo some of the damage of the last one. That's a very utopian thought and not terribly realistic, but we use fossil fuels so incredibly efficiently. The idea that driverless cars that are shared, basically a kind of shared service located off a Brownfield site does away with 95 per cent of all cars, freeing up a huge amount of space in the city to be greener, many fewer cars need to be produced, they would be on the road much less, there'd be fewer traffic jams. 

 It's just one example, but the idea that we can live much more resource-efficiently, because we are living more intelligently through using these tools. And therefore can undo some of the damage of the last Industrial Revolution. That's my main utopian hope, I guess.

56,"AI: what's the worst that could happen?
The Centre for the Future of Intelligence is seeking to investigate the implications of artificial intelligence for humanity, and make sure humans take advantage of the opportunities while dodging the risks. It launched at the University of Cambridge last October, and is a collaboration between four universities and colleges – Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial and Berkeley – backed with a 10-year, £10m grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

 Because no single discipline is ideally suited to this task, the centre emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It is bringing together a diverse community of some of the world's best researchers, philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists. 

Executive director of the centre is Stephen Cave, a writer, philosopher and former diplomat. Harry Armstrong, head of futures at Nesta, which publishes The Long + Short, spoke with Cave about the impact of AI. 

 Their conversation has been edited.
Harry  Armstrong: Do you see the interdisciplinary nature of the centre as one of its key values and one of the key impacts you hope it will have on the field?
Stephen Cave: Thinking about the impact of AI is not something that any one discipline owns or does in any very systematic way. So if academia is going to rise to the challenge and provide thought leadership on this hugely important issue, then we’re going to need to do it by breaking down current disciplinary boundaries and bringing people with very different expertise together.  

 That means bringing together the technologists and the experts at developing these algorithms together with social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and so forth.  

 I think there are many areas of science where more interdisciplinary engagement would be valuable. Biotech’s another example. In that sense AI isn’t unique, but I think because thinking about AI is still in very early stages, we have an opportunity to shape the way in which we think about it, and build that community. 

 We want to create a space where many different disciplines can come together and develop a shared language, learn from each other’s approaches, and hopefully very quickly move to be able to actually develop new ideas, new conclusions, together. But the first step is learning how to talk to each other.
At a recent talk, Naomi Klein said that addressing the challenge of climate change could not have come at a worse time. The current dominant political and economic ideologies, along with growing isolationist sentiment, runs contrary to the bipartisan, collaborative approaches needed to solve global issues like climate change. Do you see the same issues hampering a global effort to respond to the challenges AI raises?
Climate change suffers from the problem that the costs are not incurred in any direct way by the industrialists who own the technology and are profiting from it. With AI, that has been the case so far; although not on the same scale. There has been disruption but so far, compared to industrialisation, the impact has been fairly small. That will probably change. 

 AI companies, and in particular the big tech companies, are very concerned that this won't go like climate change, but rather it will go like GMOs: that people will have a gut reaction to this technology as soon as the first great swathe of job losses take hold. People speculate that 50m jobs could be lost in the US if trucking is automated, which is conceivable within 10 years. You could imagine a populist US government therefore simply banning driverless cars. 

 So I think there is anxiety in the tech industry that there could be a serious reaction against this technology at any point. And so my impression is that there is a feeling within these companies that these ethical and social implications need to be taken very seriously, now. And that a broad buy-in by society into some kind of vision of the future in which this technology plays a role is required, if a dangerous – or to them dangerous – counteraction is to be avoided.
My personal experience working with these tech companies is that they are concerned for their businesses and genuinely want to do the right thing. Of course there are intellectual challenges and there is money to be made, but equally they are people who don't think when they get up in the morning that they're going to put people out of jobs or bring about the downfall of humanity. As the industry matures it's developing a sense of responsibility. 

 So I think we've got a real opportunity, despite the general climate, and in some ways because of it. There's a great opportunity to bring industry on board to make sure the technology is developed in the right way.
One of the dominant narratives around not only AI but technology and automation more generally is that we, as humans, are at the mercy of technological progress. If you try and push against this idea you can be labelled as being anti-progress and stuck in the past. But we do have a lot more control than we give ourselves credit for. For example, routineness and susceptibility to automation are not inevitable features of occupations, job design is hugely important. How do we design jobs? How do we create jobs that allow people to do the kind of work they want to do? There can be a bit of a conflict between being impacted by what's happening and having some sort of control over what we want to happen.
Certainly, we encounter technological determinism a lot. And it's understandable. For us as individuals, of course it does feel like it always is happening and we just have to cope. No one individual can do much about it, other than adapt. 

 But that's different when we consider ourselves at a level of a society, as a polis [city state], or as an international community. I think we can shape the way in which technology develops. We have various tools. In any given country, we have regulations. There's a possibility of international regulation. 

 Technology is emerging from a certain legal, political, normative, cultural, and social framework. It's coming from a certain place. And it is shaped by all of those things. 

 And I think the more we understand a technology's relationship with those things, and the more we then consciously try to shape those things, the more we are going to influence the technology. So, for example, developing a culture of responsible innovation. For example, a kind of Hippocratic oath for AI developers. These things are within the realms of what is feasible, and I think will help to shape the future.
One of the problems with intervention, generally, is that we cannot control the course of events. We can attempt to, but we don't know how things are going to evolve. The reality is, societies are much too complex for us to be able to shape them in any very specific way, as plenty of ideologies and political movements have found to their cost. There are often unforeseen consequences that can derail a project. 

 I think, nonetheless, there are things we can do. We can try to imagine how things might go very badly wrong, and then work hard to develop systems that will stop that from happening. We can also try collectively to imagine how things could go very right. The kind of society that we actually want to live in that uses this technology. And I'm sure that will be skewed in all sorts of ways, and we might imagine things that seem wonderful and actually have terrible by-products. 

 This conversation cannot be in the hands of any one group. It oughtn't be in the hands of Silicon Valley billionaires alone. They've got their role to play, but this is a conversation we need to be having as widely as possible.
The centre is developing some really interesting projects but perhaps one of the most interesting is the discussion of what intelligence might be. Could you go into a bit more detail about the kinds of questions you are trying to explore in this area?
You mean kinds of intelligence?
Yeah.
I think this is very important because historically, we've had an overwhelming tendency to anthropomorphise. We define what intelligence is, historically, as being human-like. And then within that, being like certain humans. 

 And it's taken a very long time for the academic community to accept that there could be such a thing as non-human intelligence at all. We know that crows, for example, who have had a completely different evolutionary history, or octopuses, who have an even more different evolutionary history, might have a kind of intelligence that's very different to ours. That in some ways rivals our own, and so forth. 

 But luckily, we have got to that point in recent years of accepting that we are not the only form of intelligence. But now, AI is challenging that from a different direction. Just as we are accepting that the natural world offers this enormous range of different intelligences, we are at the same time inventing new intelligences that are radically different to humans. 

 And I think, still, this anthropomorphic picture of the kind of humanoid android, the robot, dominates our idea of what AI is too much. And too many people, and the industry as well, talk about human-level artificial intelligence as a goal, or general AI, which basically means like a human. But actually what we're building is nothing like a human. 

 When the first pocket calculator was made, it didn't do maths like a human. It was vastly better. It didn't make the occasional mistake. When we set about creating these artificial agents to solve these problems, because they have a completely different evolutionary history to humans, they solve problems in very different ways.
And until now, people have been fairly shy about describing them as intelligent. Or rather, in the history of AIs, we think solving a particular problem would require intelligence. Then we solve it. And then that's no longer intelligence, because we've solved it. Chess is a good example. 

 But the reality is, we are creating a whole new world of different artificial agents. And we need to understand that world. We need to understand all the different ways of being clever, if you like. How you can be extremely sophisticated at some particular rational process, and yet extremely bad at another one in a way that bears no relation to the way humans are on these axes. 

 And this is important, partly because we need to expand our sense of what is intelligent, like we have done with the natural world. Because lots of things follow from saying something is intelligent. Historically, we have a long tradition in Western philosophy of saying those who are intelligent should rule. So if intelligence equates to power, then obviously we need to think about what we mean by intelligence. Who has it and who doesn't. Or how it equates to rights and responsibilities. 

 It certainly is a very ambitious project to create the atlas of intelligence.
There was a point I read in something you wrote on our ideas of intelligence that I thought was very interesting. We actually tend to think of intelligence at the societal level when we think about human ability, rather than at the individual level but in the end conflate the two. I think that's a very good point, when we think about our capabilities, we think about what we can achieve as a whole, not individually. But when we talk about AI, we tend to think about that individual piece of technology, or that individual system. So for example if we think about the internet of things and AI, we should discuss intelligence as something encompassed by the whole.
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, right now, perhaps it is a product of our anthropomorphising bias. But there is a tendency to see a narrative of AI versus humanity, as if it's one or the other. And yet, obviously, there are risks in this technology long before it acquires any kind of manipulative agency. 

 Robotic technology is dangerous. Or potentially dangerous. But at the same time, most of what we're using technology for is to enhance ourselves, to increase our capacities. And a lot of what AI is going to be doing is augmenting us – we're going to be working as teams, AI-human teams.
Where do you think this AI-human conflict, or concept of a conflict, comes from? Do you think that's just a reflection of historical conversations we've had about automation, or do you think it is a deeper fear?
I do think it comes both from some biases that might well be innate, such as anthropomorphism, or our human tendency to ascribe agency to other objects, particularly moving ones, is well-established and probably has sound evolutionary roots. If it moves, it's probably wise to start asking yourself questions like, ""What is it? What might it want? Where might it be going? Might it be hungry? Do I look like food to it?"" I think it makes sense, it's natural for us to think in terms of agency. And when we do, it's natural for us to project our own ways of being and acting. And we, as primates, are profoundly co-operative. 

 But at the same time, we're competitive and murderous. We have a strong sense of in-group versus out-group, which is responsible for both a great deal of cooperation, within the in-group, but also terrible crimes. Murder, rape, pillage, genocide; and they're pointed at the out-group. 

 And so I think it's very natural for us to see AIs in terms of agents. We anthropomorphise them as these kind of android robots. And then we think about, well, you know, are they part of our in-group, or are they some other group? If they're some other group, it's us against them. Who's going to win? Well, let's see. So I think that's very natural, I think that's very human.
There is this long tradition, in Western culture in particular, with associating intelligence and dominance and power. It's interesting to speculate about how, and I wish I knew more about it, and I'd like to see more research on this, about how different cultures perceive AI. It's well known that Japan is very accepting of technology and robots, for example. 

 You can think, well, we in the West have long been justifying power relations of a certain kind on the basis that we're 'cleverer'. That's why men get to vote and women don't, or whatever. In a culture where power is not based on intelligence but, say, on a caste system, which is purely hereditary, we’d build an AI, and it would just tune in, drop out, attain enlightenment, just sit in the corner. Or we beg it to come back and help us find enlightenment. It might be that we find a completely different narrative to the one that's dominant in the West.
One of the projects the centre is running is looking into what kind of AI breakthroughs may come, when and what the social consequences could be. What do you think the future holds? What are your fears – what do you think could go right and wrong in the short, medium and long term?
That's a big question. Certainly I don't lie awake at night worried that robots are going to knock the door down and come in with a machine gun. If the robots take over the world, it won't be by knocking the door down. At the moment, I think it's certainly as big a risk that we have a GMO moment, and there's a powerful reaction against the technology which prevents us from reaping the benefits, which are enormous. I think that's as big a risk as the risks from the technologies themselves. 

 I think one worry that we haven't talked about is that we've become extremely dependent  upon this technology. And that we essentially become deskilled. There's an extent to which the history of civilisation is the history of the domestication of the human species sort of by ourselves, and also by our technology, to some extent. And AI certainly allows for that to reach a whole new level. 

 Just think about GPs with diagnostic tools. Even now, my GP consults the computer fairly regularly. But as diagnostic tools get better, what are they going to be doing other than just typing something into the computer and reading out what comes back? At which point, you might as well do away with the GP. But then, who does know about medicine? 

 And so we do need to worry about deskilling and about becoming dependent. And it is entirely possible that you can imagine a society in which we're all sort of prosperous, in a sense. Our basic bodily needs are provided for, perhaps, in a way, to an extent that we've never before even dreamed of. Unprecedented in human history. 

 And yet, we're stripped of any kind of meaningful work. We have no purpose. We're escaping to virtual reality. And then you could imagine all sorts of worrying countercultures or Luddite movements or what have you. I guess that's the kind of scenario that – I haven't sketched it terribly well – but that's the kind of thing that worries me more than missile-toting giant robots.

57,"COMPLEXITY AND HUMANITY
We have all seen the images. Volunteers pitching in. People working day
 and night; coming up with the most ingenious, improvised solutions to
 everything from food and shelter to communications and security. Working
 together; patching up the fabric that is rent. Disaster, natural or
 otherwise, is a breakdown of systems. For a time, chaos reigns. For a
 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.

 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.

 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.

57,"COMPLEXITY AND HUMANITY
We have all seen the images. Volunteers pitching in. People working day
 and night; coming up with the most ingenious, improvised solutions to
 everything from food and shelter to communications and security. Working
 together; patching up the fabric that is rent. Disaster, natural or
 otherwise, is a breakdown of systems. For a time, chaos reigns. For a
 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved

58,"New money: Do local currencies actually work?
It's lunchtime at Glasgow Chambers in late November, and Councillor George Redmond is getting worked up at the prospect a Glasgow Pound. ""We would be Glasgow-centric about it,"" he says conspiratorially, as though there is any other way to be. ""Can you imagine having the face of Billy Connolly on our local currency? Or Alex Ferguson, or Kenny Dalglish?"" 

 Inventing an alternative to sterling might sound far-fetched, even illegal. But it's not that strange. In the UK we think of the pound like fish think about water, which is to say not at all. It might never have occurred to many of us that there are other types of exchange that can stand in for ragged bank notes tucked away in pockets, or other objects that can stand in for those notes.  

 Not every country is so lucky. In crisis-hit Greece, where the euro can be hard to come by, businesses and citizens have turned to bartering using a points system where goods like pianos, pot and pans can be exchanged for security services or loaned farming equipment. In India last year, desperate people burned sacks of illegal cash after the government withdrew two high-denomination notes as part of a crackdown on corruption. Hoarders woke up to discover the banknotes under their mattresses were suddenly worthless. 

 The pound has been trading at its lowest level since 1985 since the UK voted to leave the European Union and there are fears that it could dip further as Brexit ensues. Timebanks, local exchange trading systems (LETS) and digital inventions like bitcoin can provide alternative ways for people to pay for goods and services when mainstream currencies hit crises. But they will only work if Britons are ready to accept that they have the power to invent their own currency. 

 ""At the moment, if the pound stops working for us, the whole economy grinds to a halt because there aren't alternatives,"" Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, tells those gathered in a gilded room at Glasgow Chambers to discuss the Glasgow Pound. McCann is a long-time advocate of alternative means of exchange. He is behind the ScotPound, a proposal for a new national currency for Scotland that emerged after the referendum on Scottish independence. It's an idea he no longer thinks will work, because the debate, since Brexit, has shifted from the currency issue back to ideas about Scottish independence. 

 Today, he's preaching to the converted. Alex Walker, the chairman of the 250-person Ekopia community in Northern Scotland, listens at the back. The Eko has been the main means of buying everything from beer to bananas in Ekopia since Walker founded it 20 years ago. On an adjacent table, Tracy Duff, a community learning and development worker from Clackmannanshire Council, digs out some papers. She runs the Clacks Youth Timebank, a scheme where 12- to 15-year-olds can earn credit for volunteering. Taking notes up front is Ailie Rutherford, one of the people who organised the meeting. Rutherford runs the People's Bank of Govanhill, a currency that changes value depending on the income of the user. ""I don't see any reason why we shouldn't invent our own currency and play with it,"" she says.
Everyone has gathered to decide what a Glasgow Pound might look like at a time when many are asking if local currencies can work at all. Councillor Redmond says Glasgow has been closely watching existing alternative currencies like the Brixton Pound in London, which was introduced in 2011. 

 The founders of the Brixton Pound wanted to do something to stop 80p of every £1 spent locally from leaking out of the area into the pockets of corporations, at the expense of small local traders. So they printed a currency that would have the same value as the pound, but could only be traded in independent Brixton shops, where the shopkeeper would also have to spend it locally. This year the Brixton Pound got its own cashpoint, from where people can withdraw local banknotes bearing colourful images of local heroes, like David Bowie and secret Agent Violette Szabo, to spend in over 150 local shops. It can also be used by residents to pay council tax and by employers to pay wages.
No two local currencies are exactly the same. But the Brixton Pound and other recent schemes follow the example ten years ago of the Totnes Pound, a 'complementary currency': that is, one supplementing the national currency. As fears for financial stability took hold during the recession, complementary currencies grew in popularity. The Bank of England does not consider these forms of currency legal tender, but the notes hold value in the same way as a gift-card from a department store, with the same kind of restrictions about where they can be spent. Proponents say complementary currencies boost spending in smaller geographical areas, which can have environmental benefits as businesses cut transport distances to deal with local suppliers. Detractors say they have no real economic impact and work only as a game for the middle classes, who can afford to buy from independent shops rather than chains. 

 In Britain, there are now schemes in Totnes, Lewes, Brixton, Bristol and Exeter. Hull has its own local digital currency that can be earned from volunteering and used to pay council tax. Kingston, Birmingham and Liverpool have schemes underway. Glasgow could be next. But the working group has some serious questions to answer first, not least: do complementary currencies actually work?
""People don't understand money,"" Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, says over the phone. 

 Scott Cato says the fish-in-water problem – the idea that sterling is so ubiquitous, it is never questioned – is the biggest challenge for complementary currencies. She knows all about it as a founder of the Stroud Pound in 2010, a currency that has since gone out of circulation. 

 ""[People] think they put money into a bank and someone else takes it out. What they don't understand is that banks have the power to create money. We've given the power to create money to private corporations and people don't understand that we can have it back,"" she says. 

 In Stroud, suspicion of the local currency among local businesses became a barrier to success. Scott-Cato said traders refused to join the scheme because they were ""running a business"", as though putting the community first and placing the needs of others as equivalent to their own was in itself bad business practice, or as though they were somehow being disloyal to sterling. 

 The Bristol Pound (£B) entered into circulation in September 2012. By June 2015, 1m £B had been issued, with £B700,000 of that still in circulation. In a population of some 450,000 people, that's the equivalent of each Bristolian carrying less than £B2 in change in their pocket. 

 ""The small scale is a problem and a strength,"" says Stephen Clarke, chief financial officer of the Bristol Pound. ""The benefit comes from the fact that local currencies are trusted organisations: we're a Community Interest Company limited by guarantee."" That means assets owned by the the Bristol Pound have to be used for the good of the community, rather than purely for profit.
Without enough currency in circulation, it ceases to work. Scott-Cato says Stroud's size meant meant the Stroud Pound was never viable: ""We couldn't get the velocity of circulation right, which contrasts with the Bristol Pound.""
Clarke also says the small scale of local currencies means they are ""always scrabbling around looking for money"". One way founders of the Bristol Pound have addressed his is by setting up an umbrella organisation, the Guild of Independent Currencies, to share information between local currencies in the UK and help new organisations. ""At the moment we're all reinventing the wheel every time,"" Clarke says. 

 Technology might also have a solution. Peter Ferry, a commercial director, travels to Glasgow to tell those working on the Glasgow Pound that that his company Wallet has come up with a way to use the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to make it easier for people to use multiple types of currency. ""There might be many currencies around the country that people want to use. We need to make it simple for them to do that and also to make it simple to earn these currencies in many ways,"" he says. 

 Size doesn't always matter. Sometimes, the smallest places – like Totnes and the Ekopia community – are best able to support complementary currencies because the people who live there are engaged with their local economy in a meaningful way. 

 ""Bristol is seen as a quirky, individualistic kind of place,"" Clarke says. ""When we first produced the Bristol Pound note, people were really proud of it. It got through to people not just sat around coffee shops. I'm not sure a London Pound would work, because people identify with their local area in London rather than the city as a whole.""
Bristol Pound users don't have high incomes necessarily, but surveys show they are engaged with their local community and they have a higher educational attainment than average. In the years since the financial crisis, as local authority budgets have shrunk, some areas have relied heavily on engaged communities to fill in gaps in public services. By contrast, deprived areas where people cannot afford time and money to put into their community have become more deprived, making them even harder for local currencies to reach.
""It is difficult to get into more disadvantaged areas,"" Stephen Clarke says. ""We have a ten-year life expectancy gap between different parts of the city. When you go to disadvantaged areas with the Bristol Pound hat on you realise there aren't independent shops there, there's an Aldi and Lidl and that's it."" 

 More than a third of children grow up in poverty in Glasgow. A Glasgow Pound might struggle to get poorer families to buy into a local currency that ties them to shopping at more expensive, independent shops, rather than getting deals at big supermarket chains.
When Scott-Cato and her colleagues wrote about the experience of setting up the Stroud Pound, they said it was telling that complementary currencies have been accused of being a game for middle-class people, rather than a genuine economic solution. 

 Perhaps for that reason, experts like Duncan McCann have stopped thinking of complementary currencies as a one-size-fits-all solution. He said they can function as a kind of 'gateway drug' to introduce people to a new way of thinking about money. ""That is especially for those who use it, but also for those who just become aware of it,"" he says. 

 Ciaran Mundy, CEO of the Bristol Pound, says it is important to think of the systemic impact rather than looking for targeted treatment of symptoms of economic deprivation. ""Poverty has many causes,"" he says. ""One of these is how the economy is structured in terms of how money flows out of poor areas due to high dependence on larger national and international companies paying lower wages and using offshore accounts to hide the money from the tax man."" 

 Nothing is tying Glasgow to existing models for complementary currencies. But during the first meeting about setting up the Glasgow Pound, the workshop shows just how hard it would be to invent a new system that works for everyone.  

 Each table is handed a wad of Post-it notes and a piece of white paper. A table leader asks everyone to write on the Post-its what they want the Glasgow Pound to achieve. Elbowing teacups out the way, people get to work. They scrawl a dizzying number of proposals, from keeping more wealth in the local area to empowering people who feel cut out of the national economy, or to moving towards land reform and saving the environment. Team leaders try to assemble these ideas in themes to report back to the room. 

 On one table, Duncan McCann encourages people to urge businesses to do things they have never done before. ""One of the goals should be to move businesses from where they are today into the future,"" he says. 

 After years of researc,h McCann believes the only way complementary currencies can create real value for local economies is if they make transactions happen that wouldn't otherwise have taken place. 

 ""They need to create additional spending power. This is this what the local currencies, despite all their good points, fail to do,"" McCann says.
Every time a Brixton Pound transaction is made, 1.5 per cent goes into a Brixton Fund. This is used to give micro-grants of between a few hundred and £2000 to local projects and community groups. ""We aim to target projects that aren't large enough to apply for more formal grant funding,"" says Lucy Çava, project manager at the Brixton Pound. 

 ""We see this as part of community building – linking the Brixton Pound user with community groups, so both groups become more visible to each other through the currency and fund. This is particularly important in Brixton because of the gentrification debates which are very salient round there,"" Çava says. 

 Meanwhile, the people behind the Bristol Pound are readying a mutual credit network called Bristol Prospects. Through this network, businesses in Bristol can exchange credit in the form of loans that are neutralised within the network, helping one another to grow without relying on the high rates of commercial lenders.  

 Once operational, loans offered through the Prospects network will have negative interest, so that businesses are encouraged to pass credit on as quickly as possible. ""That's the plan,"" says Clarke, ""because it's rather like a hot potato: people will want to pass it on.""  

 ""We know from research that a number of small businesses in Bristol are struggling to get money on reasonable terms,"" says Clarke, ""and that banks are not interested in smaller loans to businesses. So we think there is a strength in the Bristol Pound network to start something like this that is linked, but separate."" 

 Duncan McCann, with all his experience, knows that challenge is worthwhile. ""As people we have a right to make credit and loan money. We mustn't forget that. We mustn't leave that to corporations and the state,"" he says.

",3,Which is true about the various types of local currency?,0,"They are used in addition to the national currency, not as a replacement",3,They are too hard to spend and thus the national currencies are always favored
58,"New money: Do local currencies actually work?
It's lunchtime at Glasgow Chambers in late November, and Councillor George Redmond is getting worked up at the prospect a Glasgow Pound. ""We would be Glasgow-centric about it,"" he says conspiratorially, as though there is any other way to be. ""Can you imagine having the face of Billy Connolly on our local currency? Or Alex Ferguson, or Kenny Dalglish?"" 

 Inventing an alternative to sterling might sound far-fetched, even illegal. But it's not that strange. In the UK we think of the pound like fish think about water, which is to say not at all. It might never have occurred to many of us that there are other types of exchange that can stand in for ragged bank notes tucked away in pockets, or other objects that can stand in for those notes.  

 Not every country is so lucky. In crisis-hit Greece, where the euro can be hard to come by, businesses and citizens have turned to bartering using a points system where goods like pianos, pot and pans can be exchanged for security services or loaned farming equipment. In India last year, desperate people burned sacks of illegal cash after the government withdrew two high-denomination notes as part of a crackdown on corruption. Hoarders woke up to discover the banknotes under their mattresses were suddenly worthless. 

 The pound has been trading at its lowest level since 1985 since the UK voted to leave the European Union and there are fears that it could dip further as Brexit ensues. Timebanks, local exchange trading systems (LETS) and digital inventions like bitcoin can provide alternative ways for people to pay for goods and services when mainstream currencies hit crises. But they will only work if Britons are ready to accept that they have the power to invent their own currency. 

 ""At the moment, if the pound stops working for us, the whole economy grinds to a halt because there aren't alternatives,"" Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, tells those gathered in a gilded room at Glasgow Chambers to discuss the Glasgow Pound. McCann is a long-time advocate of alternative means of exchange. He is behind the ScotPound, a proposal for a new national currency for Scotland that emerged after the referendum on Scottish independence. It's an idea he no longer thinks will work, because the debate, since Brexit, has shifted from the currency issue back to ideas about Scottish independence. 

 Today, he's preaching to the converted. Alex Walker, the chairman of the 250-person Ekopia community in Northern Scotland, listens at the back. The Eko has been the main means of buying everything from beer to bananas in Ekopia since Walker founded it 20 years ago. On an adjacent table, Tracy Duff, a community learning and development worker from Clackmannanshire Council, digs out some papers. She runs the Clacks Youth Timebank, a scheme where 12- to 15-year-olds can earn credit for volunteering. Taking notes up front is Ailie Rutherford, one of the people who organised the meeting. Rutherford runs the People's Bank of Govanhill, a currency that changes value depending on the income of the user. ""I don't see any reason why we shouldn't invent our own currency and play with it,"" she says.
Everyone has gathered to decide what a Glasgow Pound might look like at a time when many are asking if local currencies can work at all. Councillor Redmond says Glasgow has been closely watching existing alternative currencies like the Brixton Pound in London, which was introduced in 2011. 

 The founders of the Brixton Pound wanted to do something to stop 80p of every £1 spent locally from leaking out of the area into the pockets of corporations, at the expense of small local traders. So they printed a currency that would have the same value as the pound, but could only be traded in independent Brixton shops, where the shopkeeper would also have to spend it locally. This year the Brixton Pound got its own cashpoint, from where people can withdraw local banknotes bearing colourful images of local heroes, like David Bowie and secret Agent Violette Szabo, to spend in over 150 local shops. It can also be used by residents to pay council tax and by employers to pay wages.
No two local currencies are exactly the same. But the Brixton Pound and other recent schemes follow the example ten years ago of the Totnes Pound, a 'complementary currency': that is, one supplementing the national currency. As fears for financial stability took hold during the recession, complementary currencies grew in popularity. The Bank of England does not consider these forms of currency legal tender, but the notes hold value in the same way as a gift-card from a department store, with the same kind of restrictions about where they can be spent. Proponents say complementary currencies boost spending in smaller geographical areas, which can have environmental benefits as businesses cut transport distances to deal with local suppliers. Detractors say they have no real economic impact and work only as a game for the middle classes, who can afford to buy from independent shops rather than chains. 

 In Britain, there are now schemes in Totnes, Lewes, Brixton, Bristol and Exeter. Hull has its own local digital currency that can be earned from volunteering and used to pay council tax. Kingston, Birmingham and Liverpool have schemes underway. Glasgow could be next. But the working group has some serious questions to answer first, not least: do complementary currencies actually work?
""People don't understand money,"" Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, says over the phone. 

 Scott Cato says the fish-in-water problem – the idea that sterling is so ubiquitous, it is never questioned – is the biggest challenge for complementary currencies. She knows all about it as a founder of the Stroud Pound in 2010, a currency that has since gone out of circulation. 

 ""[People] think they put money into a bank and someone else takes it out. What they don't understand is that banks have the power to create money. We've given the power to create money to private corporations and people don't understand that we can have it back,"" she says. 

 In Stroud, suspicion of the local currency among local businesses became a barrier to success. Scott-Cato said traders refused to join the scheme because they were ""running a business"", as though putting the community first and placing the needs of others as equivalent to their own was in itself bad business practice, or as though they were somehow being disloyal to sterling. 

 The Bristol Pound (£B) entered into circulation in September 2012. By June 2015, 1m £B had been issued, with £B700,000 of that still in circulation. In a population of some 450,000 people, that's the equivalent of each Bristolian carrying less than £B2 in change in their pocket. 

 ""The small scale is a problem and a strength,"" says Stephen Clarke, chief financial officer of the Bristol Pound. ""The benefit comes from the fact that local currencies are trusted organisations: we're a Community Interest Company limited by guarantee."" That means assets owned by the the Bristol Pound have to be used for the good of the community, rather than purely for profit.
Without enough currency in circulation, it ceases to work. Scott-Cato says Stroud's size meant meant the Stroud Pound was never viable: ""We couldn't get the velocity of circulation right, which contrasts with the Bristol Pound.""
Clarke also says the small scale of local currencies means they are ""always scrabbling around looking for money"". One way founders of the Bristol Pound have addressed his is by setting up an umbrella organisation, the Guild of Independent Currencies, to share information between local currencies in the UK and help new organisations. ""At the moment we're all reinventing the wheel every time,"" Clarke says. 

 Technology might also have a solution. Peter Ferry, a commercial director, travels to Glasgow to tell those working on the Glasgow Pound that that his company Wallet has come up with a way to use the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to make it easier for people to use multiple types of currency. ""There might be many currencies around the country that people want to use. We need to make it simple for them to do that and also to make it simple to earn these currencies in many ways,"" he says. 

 Size doesn't always matter. Sometimes, the smallest places – like Totnes and the Ekopia community – are best able to support complementary currencies because the people who live there are engaged with their local economy in a meaningful way. 

 ""Bristol is seen as a quirky, individualistic kind of place,"" Clarke says. ""When we first produced the Bristol Pound note, people were really proud of it. It got through to people not just sat around coffee shops. I'm not sure a London Pound would work, because people identify with their local area in London rather than the city as a whole.""
Bristol Pound users don't have high incomes necessarily, but surveys show they are engaged with their local community and they have a higher educational attainment than average. In the years since the financial crisis, as local authority budgets have shrunk, some areas have relied heavily on engaged communities to fill in gaps in public services. By contrast, deprived areas where people cannot afford time and money to put into their community have become more deprived, making them even harder for local currencies to reach.
""It is difficult to get into more disadvantaged areas,"" Stephen Clarke says. ""We have a ten-year life expectancy gap between different parts of the city. When you go to disadvantaged areas with the Bristol Pound hat on you realise there aren't independent shops there, there's an Aldi and Lidl and that's it."" 

 More than a third of children grow up in poverty in Glasgow. A Glasgow Pound might struggle to get poorer families to buy into a local currency that ties them to shopping at more expensive, independent shops, rather than getting deals at big supermarket chains.
When Scott-Cato and her colleagues wrote about the experience of setting up the Stroud Pound, they said it was telling that complementary currencies have been accused of being a game for middle-class people, rather than a genuine economic solution. 

 Perhaps for that reason, experts like Duncan McCann have stopped thinking of complementary currencies as a one-size-fits-all solution. He said they can function as a kind of 'gateway drug' to introduce people to a new way of thinking about money. ""That is especially for those who use it, but also for those who just become aware of it,"" he says. 

 Ciaran Mundy, CEO of the Bristol Pound, says it is important to think of the systemic impact rather than looking for targeted treatment of symptoms of economic deprivation. ""Poverty has many causes,"" he says. ""One of these is how the economy is structured in terms of how money flows out of poor areas due to high dependence on larger national and international companies paying lower wages and using offshore accounts to hide the money from the tax man."" 

 Nothing is tying Glasgow to existing models for complementary currencies. But during the first meeting about setting up the Glasgow Pound, the workshop shows just how hard it would be to invent a new system that works for everyone.

On an adjacent table, Tracy Duff, a community learning and development worker from Clackmannanshire Council, digs out some papers. She runs the Clacks Youth Timebank, a scheme where 12- to 15-year-olds can earn credit for volunteering. Taking notes up front is Ailie Rutherford, one of the people who organised the meeting. Rutherford runs the People's Bank of Govanhill, a currency that changes value depending on the income of the user. ""I don't see any reason why we shouldn't invent our own currency and play with it,"" she says.
Everyone has gathered to decide what a Glasgow Pound might look like at a time when many are asking if local currencies can work at all. Councillor Redmond says Glasgow has been closely watching existing alternative currencies like the Brixton Pound in London, which was introduced in 2011. 

 The founders of the Brixton Pound wanted to do something to stop 80p of every £1 spent locally from leaking out of the area into the pockets of corporations, at the expense of small local traders. So they printed a currency that would have the same value as the pound, but could only be traded in independent Brixton shops, where the shopkeeper would also have to spend it locally. This year the Brixton Pound got its own cashpoint, from where people can withdraw local banknotes bearing colourful images of local heroes, like David Bowie and secret Agent Violette Szabo, to spend in over 150 local shops. It can also be used by residents to pay council tax and by employers to pay wages.
No two local currencies are exactly the same. But the Brixton Pound and other recent schemes follow the example ten years ago of the Totnes Pound, a 'complementary currency': that is, one supplementing the national currency. As fears for financial stability took hold during the recession, complementary currencies grew in popularity. The Bank of England does not consider these forms of currency legal tender, but the notes hold value in the same way as a gift-card from a department store, with the same kind of restrictions about where they can be spent. Proponents say complementary currencies boost spending in smaller geographical areas, which can have environmental benefits as businesses cut transport distances to deal with local suppliers. Detractors say they have no real economic impact and work only as a game for the middle classes, who can afford to buy from independent shops rather than chains. 

 In Britain, there are now schemes in Totnes, Lewes, Brixton, Bristol and Exeter. Hull has its own local digital currency that can be earned from volunteering and used to pay council tax. Kingston, Birmingham and Liverpool have schemes underway. Glasgow could be next. But the working group has some serious questions to answer first, not least: do complementary currencies actually work?
""People don't understand money,"" Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, says over the phone. 

 Scott Cato says the fish-in-water problem – the idea that sterling is so ubiquitous, it is never questioned – is the biggest challenge for complementary currencies. She knows all about it as a founder of the Stroud Pound in 2010, a currency that has since gone out of circulation. 

 ""[People] think they put money into a bank and someone else takes it out. What they don't understand is that banks have the power to create money. We've given the power to create money to private corporations and people don't understand that we can have it back,"" she says. 

 In Stroud, suspicion of the local currency among local businesses became a barrier to success. Scott-Cato said traders refused to join the scheme because they were ""running a business"", as though putting the community first and placing the needs of others as equivalent to their own was in itself bad business practice, or as though they were somehow being disloyal to sterling. 

 The Bristol Pound (£B) entered into circulation in September 2012. By June 2015, 1m £B had been issued, with £B700,000 of that still in circulation. In a population of some 450,000 people, that's the equivalent of each Bristolian carrying less than £B2 in change in their pocket. 

 ""The small scale is a problem and a strength,"" says Stephen Clarke, chief financial officer of the Bristol Pound. ""The benefit comes from the fact that local currencies are trusted organisations: we're a Community Interest Company limited by guarantee."" That means assets owned by the the Bristol Pound have to be used for the good of the community, rather than purely for profit.
Without enough currency in circulation, it ceases to work. Scott-Cato says Stroud's size meant meant the Stroud Pound was never viable: ""We couldn't get the velocity of circulation right, which contrasts with the Bristol Pound.""
Clarke also says the small scale of local currencies means they are ""always scrabbling around looking for money"". One way founders of the Bristol Pound have addressed his is by setting up an umbrella organisation, the Guild of Independent Currencies, to share information between local currencies in the UK and help new organisations. ""At the moment we're all reinventing the wheel every time,"" Clarke says. 

 Technology might also have a solution. Peter Ferry, a commercial director, travels to Glasgow to tell those working on the Glasgow Pound that that his company Wallet has come up with a way to use the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to make it easier for people to use multiple types of currency. ""There might be many currencies around the country that people want to use. We need to make it simple for them to do that and also to make it simple to earn these currencies in many ways,"" he says. 

 Size doesn't always matter. Sometimes, the smallest places – like Totnes and the Ekopia community – are best able to support complementary currencies because the people who live there are engaged with their local economy in a meaningful way. 

 ""Bristol is seen as a quirky, individualistic kind of place,"" Clarke says. ""When we first produced the Bristol Pound note, people were really proud of it. It got through to people not just sat around coffee shops. I'm not sure a London Pound would work, because people identify with their local area in London rather than the city as a whole.""
Bristol Pound users don't have high incomes necessarily, but surveys show they are engaged with their local community and they have a higher educational attainment than average. In the years since the financial crisis, as local authority budgets have shrunk, some areas have relied heavily on engaged communities to fill in gaps in public services. By contrast, deprived areas where people cannot afford time and money to put into their community have become more deprived, making them even harder for local currencies to reach.
""It is difficult to get into more disadvantaged areas,"" Stephen Clarke says. ""We have a ten-year life expectancy gap between different parts of the city. When you go to disadvantaged areas with the Bristol Pound hat on you realise there aren't independent shops there, there's an Aldi and Lidl and that's it."" 

 More than a third of children grow up in poverty in Glasgow. A Glasgow Pound might struggle to get poorer families to buy into a local currency that ties them to shopping at more expensive, independent shops, rather than getting deals at big supermarket chains.
When Scott-Cato and her colleagues wrote about the experience of setting up the Stroud Pound, they said it was telling that complementary currencies have been accused of being a game for middle-class people, rather than a genuine economic solution. 

 Perhaps for that reason, experts like Duncan McCann have stopped thinking of complementary currencies as a one-size-fits-all solution. He said they can function as a kind of 'gateway drug' to introduce people to a new way of thinking about money. ""That is especially for those who use it, but also for those who just become aware of it,"" he says. 

 Ciaran Mundy, CEO of the Bristol Pound, says it is important to think of the systemic impact rather than looking for targeted treatment of symptoms of economic deprivation. ""Poverty has many causes,"" he says. ""One of these is how the economy is structured in terms of how money flows out of poor areas due to high dependence on larger national and international companies paying lower wages and using offshore accounts to hide the money from the tax man."" 

 Nothing is tying Glasgow to existing models for complementary currencies. But during the first meeting about setting up the Glasgow Pound, the workshop shows just how hard it would be to invent a new system that works for everyone.  

 Each table is handed a wad of Post-it notes and a piece of white paper. A table leader asks everyone to write on the Post-its what they want the Glasgow Pound to achieve. Elbowing teacups out the way, people get to work. They scrawl a dizzying number of proposals, from keeping more wealth in the local area to empowering people who feel cut out of the national economy, or to moving towards land reform and saving the environment. Team leaders try to assemble these ideas in themes to report back to the room. 

 On one table, Duncan McCann encourages people to urge businesses to do things they have never done before. ""One of the goals should be to move businesses from where they are today into the future,"" he says. 

 After years of researc,h McCann believes the only way complementary currencies can create real value for local economies is if they make transactions happen that wouldn't otherwise have taken place. 

 ""They need to create additional spending power. This is this what the local currencies, despite all their good points, fail to do,"" McCann says.
Every time a Brixton Pound transaction is made, 1.5 per cent goes into a Brixton Fund. This is used to give micro-grants of between a few hundred and £2000 to local projects and community groups. ""We aim to target projects that aren't large enough to apply for more formal grant funding,"" says Lucy Çava, project manager at the Brixton Pound. 

 ""We see this as part of community building – linking the Brixton Pound user with community groups, so both groups become more visible to each other through the currency and fund. This is particularly important in Brixton because of the gentrification debates which are very salient round there,"" Çava says. 

 Meanwhile, the people behind the Bristol Pound are readying a mutual credit network called Bristol Prospects. Through this network, businesses in Bristol can exchange credit in the form of loans that are neutralised within the network, helping one another to grow without relying on the high rates of commercial lenders.  

 Once operational, loans offered through the Prospects network will have negative interest, so that businesses are encouraged to pass credit on as quickly as possible. ""That's the plan,"" says Clarke, ""because it's rather like a hot potato: people will want to pass it on.""  

 ""We know from research that a number of small businesses in Bristol are struggling to get money on reasonable terms,"" says Clarke, ""and that banks are not interested in smaller loans to businesses. So we think there is a strength in the Bristol Pound network to start something like this that is linked, but separate."" 

 Duncan McCann, with all his experience, knows that challenge is worthwhile. ""As people we have a right to make credit and loan money. We mustn't forget that. We mustn't leave that to corporations and the state,"" he says.

59,"What cities in the post-Brexit era could learn from a 14th-century trading bloc
As you fly from the country now known as Germany to Britain, the coastal geography of northern European cities gently unfurls. You can see where the sea smacks into them, or where yawning estuaries unfold like funnels between green and brown city and choppy blue water. You can track the snaking rivers and canals that form unrepentant umbilical connections to the settlements set a little further inland.  

 By their nature cities along coasts and rivers developed so they could be open to trade with each other. From the middle of the 13th century, and for some 300 years after, many settlements dotted along this route formed the prosperous Hanseatic League, a European trading confederation of market towns, before the rise of the nation state led to its dissolution. 

 The Hanseatic League is not well known, and today it lives on most prominently in the name of the German national airline Lufthansa, literally the 'Hansa of the skies', whose planes you can look out of – and down towards the Hanseatic cities – on the short journeys between mainland Europe and Britain. The letters HH on the number plates of cars in Hamburg stand for Hansestadt Hamburg: another proud little memory of this hidden history. 

 In the traumatised atmosphere of post-Brexit Britain, it is worth remembering the Hanseatic League. It could point us towards new relationships between progressive city dwellers in a world that otherwise seems to be putting the brakes on modernity. 

 Despite some of Britain's Leave voters longing to inhabit a fantastical realm immune to foreign influence, the reality is patently very different to that. In the late 1300s, Chaucer wrote about characters travelling to Jerusalem, and others who came from Europe; and it was at exactly this point that the Hanseatic League slowly started to coalesce, eventually influencing our isles. 

 The League is most easily understood as a loose federation of cities that acted together in self-interest to promote trade. The Hanseatic cities developed their own legal system, and their armies came to one another's aid. Merchants who wanted to buy and sell and travel were taking the lead at a time when nation states were not fit for purpose: in the case of England or Denmark, leadership was too centralised and authoritarian, while in German-speaking lands a nation had yet to be formed.  

 We think of nations today as elemental almost, immovable. Yet look at any city of Mitteleuropa and you'll see the many different names it has had as borders and regimes have shifted with the sands of time. Nations come and go. Cities endure.  

 ""It is often said that great cities survived great empires,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, editor-in-chief of the Rotterdam-based online publishing platform Amateur Cities. ""So it is not unrealistic to think of cities as discrete entities that compete and collaborate with each other, independently from the states to which they belong."" 

 The cities involved in the Hanseatic League are found along the Baltic and North Sea coasts, and slightly inland too. The League stretched from Novgorod in the east – in what is now Russia – to London in the west. Tallinn, Riga, Gdańsk, Visby, Berlin, Cologne, Antwerp, Stockholm, Bergen, Kiel, Rostock, Dinant, Bruges, Turku, Groningen, Hanover, Wroclaw, Kaliningrad: all were involved at different stages in the Hanse's history, which ran on into the 1500s.  

 The League covered lands that today find themselves a part of the modern nations of Finland, Sweden, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. It was a huge – and hugely ambitious – undertaking in the days when communications consisted of ink and paper and the only viable method of travel was by ship. Wood, fur, wool, silver, herring, cod and salt were the main items traded. But what was also exchanged was knowledge. In some ways it was an exercise in what we today call 'soft diplomacy'. There was no maniacal ruler overseeing things – merchants met and talked. They raised armies and waged war against kings who threatened their businesses and their freedoms and their peace.
There was a kind of proto-democracy at work. Professor Rainer Postel, of the Bundeswehr Universität (Germany's equivalent of Sandhurst military academy), has described the Hanse as ""a community of interests without power politics"". As David Abulafia, Professor of Mediterranean History at Cambridge points out, ""The lack of an elaborate superstructure was one of the things that made the Hanse work. Having said that, one should recognise that Lübeck in particular dominated the League for long periods.""  

 Lübeck was where the merchants most often met; and where renewed recent interest in the Hanse eventually led to Angela Merkel cutting the ribbon at the brand new European Hansemuseum in the city last year.
Germany today – multicultural, economically and culturally motoring, free and fair – seems like the ideal model for a modern European nation state. And part of that success lies in the gravitas the country has given to its Hanseatic history. For Germany is not a top-down country with one city unhealthily dominating as with France and Britain (regional economic inequalities have plagued Britain since the painful de-industrialisation of the 1980s, especially in the north). Germany respects federalism and its cities exist on a much more even keel. The way that Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart all bring varied economic and cultural character to the party is pure Hanse. The former Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen have city state status within Germany, putting them on the same level as a whole region or 'land' like Bavaria or Brandenburg. 

 So how about a new Hanseatic League? I ask Benjamin Barber, senior fellow at New York's Fordham University. ""I believe you will find there is a new Hanse,"" he says, ""that constituted itself about 10 or 11 years ago – including many of the original Hanseatic League cities."" Barber is founder of the Global Parliament of Mayors, which he describes as a kind of Hanse of all cities, not just European ports, which will give cities a global urban voice and a common platform for action. The parliament convenes for its inaugural session in The Hague in September. 

 ""Cities both exist within nations and transcend nations. Their power lies not just in the extent of
de jure
autonomy ceded or granted by 'higher' levels of government,"" says Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Washington DC thinktank the Brookings Institution. ""Rather, cities have de facto power, the result of larger market and demographic forces and environmental imperatives that value proximity, density, connectivity and quality. Smart nations will see themselves as partners to their cities, setting strong platforms for urban prosperity and devolving powers, where appropriate, to give cities the flexibility to perform… Dumb nations will continue to dictate from above, stifling market activity and urban potential."" 

 But could we go further? Could cities like London declare independence from the UK? London's economy is larger than that of Scotland and Wales combined. ""States will not vanish or surrender their waning sovereignty,"" says Benjamin Barber. ""But cities will meet across frontiers and work together to solve problems. The objective is not an independent London or New York, but interdependent cities collaborating globally. And that is happening."" 

 London's voters largely wanted to remain a part of the EU and to maintain the city's status as an entrepôt. There is clearly a widening chasm between urban and rural life at the heart of many nations. Visualisations of Austria's recent presidential election showed the issue clearly: the country's cities voted for the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, while the the rural districts went for right-wing nationalist Norbert Hofer (whose legal challenge to the close result has resulted in a rerun being announced for October). And in the USA in November, it's likely that Trump voters will also come from rural areas and Clinton voters from the cities. City dwellers are finding ever more in common with the world's other city dwellers than with their countrymen 50 miles down the road. 

 Back in Britain, one of history's little oddities pops up on the east coast. Boston in Lincolnshire and King's Lynn in Norfolk were both forward-looking Hanseatic League towns that traded with far-flung ports and hosted foreign merchants. King's Lynn contains the only extantHanse House left in Britain (London's was knocked down to build Cannon Street Station in the 1800s). Yet in the EU referendum these two areas polled among the highest Leave votes of anywhere in the country. 

 ""Things change,"" says LSE's Professor Tony Travers. ""[King's Lynn] used to be very highly connected, but the economy moved on and left those trading ports like it in a different situation."" Take, for example, the pivot towards the New World, with which trade made more sense from the west-coast ports like Bristol and Liverpool. While these boomed between the 1600s and 1800s, the Hanseatic ports declined and then died out. ""One of the things that's interesting about the [referendum] decision is that it begs all sorts of questions about the future of the UK and its relationship with Europe; and of London and Scotland and their relationship with the rest of Europe. When the EU began as the EEC in the mid-20th century some saw it as a modern day Hanse. Now the EU seems to be waning, perhaps its successor will have to ape the Hanse even more."" 

 For all its complex beauty, life can ultimately be reduced to a series of binary options: yes or no, stick or twist, in or out, innovation or stagnation, modernity or mythology. The referendum result was disappointing for many progressive observers because it felt like a step backwards. Despite being primarily about trade monopolies and money making, the Hanse was, in its way, an early stab at stepping forwards: it encompassed internationalism, rational thought, free trade, loose democratic institutions and, most crucially of all, movement. 

 The future, for many observers, can only be understood in terms of the free movement of people, capital, goods and ideas. It is this necessary movement, and its possible curtailment, that could be the spark that leads to cities like London to seek independence and parity with other world cities – rather than with the rural hinterlands of Britain. 

 Of course, cities seceding from their nation states would provide huge headaches for countries whose biggest economic driver had been removed – as well as likely deepening ideological differences between city and rural dwellers. Moreover, cities need the food the countryside provides.  

 Yet for all the potential pitfalls, city states can thrive. Look at Singapore, Hong Kong, or de facto city states like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. One of the most telling characteristics about these four – all of course former British imperial enclaves – is that they are utterly outward looking. To return to the sky analogy, it's the airlines of each of these (Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Etihad) that open up each respective city to the world in the way that the machinery of the Hanse did on the Baltic Sea 600 years ago. And it's the unions each city makes with other places that also look thoroughly Hanseatic in character. A model for modern city states, then. But is it one that we want? 

 ""The Hanseatic League was not always accepted by local citizens,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, ""because the privileges granted to the Hanse merchants were forcing local traders out of competition and many cities took steps to eliminate them. The reasons the countryside is turning to the right [globally] are not independent from cities turning increasingly into speculation machines for the profit of a happy few. It is basically these systemic contradictions that must be addressed before we resort to more isolationist ideas that would intensify the urban-rural political divide. The bottom line is not whether a contemporary Hanse-esque federation is possible, it probably is; but whether it is actually desirable.""

It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present. 

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

60,"Obstetrics for beginners
It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present. 

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

63,"COMPLEXITY AND HUMANITY
We have all seen the images. Volunteers pitching in. People working day
 and night; coming up with the most ingenious, improvised solutions to
 everything from food and shelter to communications and security. Working
 together; patching up the fabric that is rent. Disaster, natural or
 otherwise, is a breakdown of systems. For a time, chaos reigns. For a
 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.

64,"New money: Do local currencies actually work?
It's lunchtime at Glasgow Chambers in late November, and Councillor George Redmond is getting worked up at the prospect a Glasgow Pound. ""We would be Glasgow-centric about it,"" he says conspiratorially, as though there is any other way to be. ""Can you imagine having the face of Billy Connolly on our local currency? Or Alex Ferguson, or Kenny Dalglish?"" 

 Inventing an alternative to sterling might sound far-fetched, even illegal. But it's not that strange. In the UK we think of the pound like fish think about water, which is to say not at all. It might never have occurred to many of us that there are other types of exchange that can stand in for ragged bank notes tucked away in pockets, or other objects that can stand in for those notes.  

 Not every country is so lucky. In crisis-hit Greece, where the euro can be hard to come by, businesses and citizens have turned to bartering using a points system where goods like pianos, pot and pans can be exchanged for security services or loaned farming equipment. In India last year, desperate people burned sacks of illegal cash after the government withdrew two high-denomination notes as part of a crackdown on corruption. Hoarders woke up to discover the banknotes under their mattresses were suddenly worthless. 

 The pound has been trading at its lowest level since 1985 since the UK voted to leave the European Union and there are fears that it could dip further as Brexit ensues. Timebanks, local exchange trading systems (LETS) and digital inventions like bitcoin can provide alternative ways for people to pay for goods and services when mainstream currencies hit crises. But they will only work if Britons are ready to accept that they have the power to invent their own currency. 

 ""At the moment, if the pound stops working for us, the whole economy grinds to a halt because there aren't alternatives,"" Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, tells those gathered in a gilded room at Glasgow Chambers to discuss the Glasgow Pound. McCann is a long-time advocate of alternative means of exchange. He is behind the ScotPound, a proposal for a new national currency for Scotland that emerged after the referendum on Scottish independence. It's an idea he no longer thinks will work, because the debate, since Brexit, has shifted from the currency issue back to ideas about Scottish independence. 

 Today, he's preaching to the converted. Alex Walker, the chairman of the 250-person Ekopia community in Northern Scotland, listens at the back. The Eko has been the main means of buying everything from beer to bananas in Ekopia since Walker founded it 20 years ago. On an adjacent table, Tracy Duff, a community learning and development worker from Clackmannanshire Council, digs out some papers. She runs the Clacks Youth Timebank, a scheme where 12- to 15-year-olds can earn credit for volunteering. Taking notes up front is Ailie Rutherford, one of the people who organised the meeting. Rutherford runs the People's Bank of Govanhill, a currency that changes value depending on the income of the user. ""I don't see any reason why we shouldn't invent our own currency and play with it,"" she says.
Everyone has gathered to decide what a Glasgow Pound might look like at a time when many are asking if local currencies can work at all. Councillor Redmond says Glasgow has been closely watching existing alternative currencies like the Brixton Pound in London, which was introduced in 2011. 

 The founders of the Brixton Pound wanted to do something to stop 80p of every £1 spent locally from leaking out of the area into the pockets of corporations, at the expense of small local traders. So they printed a currency that would have the same value as the pound, but could only be traded in independent Brixton shops, where the shopkeeper would also have to spend it locally. This year the Brixton Pound got its own cashpoint, from where people can withdraw local banknotes bearing colourful images of local heroes, like David Bowie and secret Agent Violette Szabo, to spend in over 150 local shops. It can also be used by residents to pay council tax and by employers to pay wages.
No two local currencies are exactly the same. But the Brixton Pound and other recent schemes follow the example ten years ago of the Totnes Pound, a 'complementary currency': that is, one supplementing the national currency. As fears for financial stability took hold during the recession, complementary currencies grew in popularity. The Bank of England does not consider these forms of currency legal tender, but the notes hold value in the same way as a gift-card from a department store, with the same kind of restrictions about where they can be spent. Proponents say complementary currencies boost spending in smaller geographical areas, which can have environmental benefits as businesses cut transport distances to deal with local suppliers. Detractors say they have no real economic impact and work only as a game for the middle classes, who can afford to buy from independent shops rather than chains. 

 In Britain, there are now schemes in Totnes, Lewes, Brixton, Bristol and Exeter. Hull has its own local digital currency that can be earned from volunteering and used to pay council tax. Kingston, Birmingham and Liverpool have schemes underway. Glasgow could be next. But the working group has some serious questions to answer first, not least: do complementary currencies actually work?
""People don't understand money,"" Molly Scott Cato, Green MEP for the South West of England and Gibraltar, says over the phone. 

 Scott Cato says the fish-in-water problem – the idea that sterling is so ubiquitous, it is never questioned – is the biggest challenge for complementary currencies. She knows all about it as a founder of the Stroud Pound in 2010, a currency that has since gone out of circulation. 

 ""[People] think they put money into a bank and someone else takes it out. What they don't understand is that banks have the power to create money. We've given the power to create money to private corporations and people don't understand that we can have it back,"" she says. 

 In Stroud, suspicion of the local currency among local businesses became a barrier to success. Scott-Cato said traders refused to join the scheme because they were ""running a business"", as though putting the community first and placing the needs of others as equivalent to their own was in itself bad business practice, or as though they were somehow being disloyal to sterling. 

 The Bristol Pound (£B) entered into circulation in September 2012. By June 2015, 1m £B had been issued, with £B700,000 of that still in circulation. In a population of some 450,000 people, that's the equivalent of each Bristolian carrying less than £B2 in change in their pocket. 

 ""The small scale is a problem and a strength,"" says Stephen Clarke, chief financial officer of the Bristol Pound. ""The benefit comes from the fact that local currencies are trusted organisations: we're a Community Interest Company limited by guarantee."" That means assets owned by the the Bristol Pound have to be used for the good of the community, rather than purely for profit.
Without enough currency in circulation, it ceases to work. Scott-Cato says Stroud's size meant meant the Stroud Pound was never viable: ""We couldn't get the velocity of circulation right, which contrasts with the Bristol Pound.""
Clarke also says the small scale of local currencies means they are ""always scrabbling around looking for money"". One way founders of the Bristol Pound have addressed his is by setting up an umbrella organisation, the Guild of Independent Currencies, to share information between local currencies in the UK and help new organisations. ""At the moment we're all reinventing the wheel every time,"" Clarke says. 

 Technology might also have a solution. Peter Ferry, a commercial director, travels to Glasgow to tell those working on the Glasgow Pound that that his company Wallet has come up with a way to use the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, to make it easier for people to use multiple types of currency. ""There might be many currencies around the country that people want to use. We need to make it simple for them to do that and also to make it simple to earn these currencies in many ways,"" he says. 

 Size doesn't always matter. Sometimes, the smallest places – like Totnes and the Ekopia community – are best able to support complementary currencies because the people who live there are engaged with their local economy in a meaningful way. 

 ""Bristol is seen as a quirky, individualistic kind of place,"" Clarke says. ""When we first produced the Bristol Pound note, people were really proud of it. It got through to people not just sat around coffee shops. I'm not sure a London Pound would work, because people identify with their local area in London rather than the city as a whole.""
Bristol Pound users don't have high incomes necessarily, but surveys show they are engaged with their local community and they have a higher educational attainment than average. In the years since the financial crisis, as local authority budgets have shrunk, some areas have relied heavily on engaged communities to fill in gaps in public services. By contrast, deprived areas where people cannot afford time and money to put into their community have become more deprived, making them even harder for local currencies to reach.
""It is difficult to get into more disadvantaged areas,"" Stephen Clarke says. ""We have a ten-year life expectancy gap between different parts of the city. When you go to disadvantaged areas with the Bristol Pound hat on you realise there aren't independent shops there, there's an Aldi and Lidl and that's it."" 

 More than a third of children grow up in poverty in Glasgow. A Glasgow Pound might struggle to get poorer families to buy into a local currency that ties them to shopping at more expensive, independent shops, rather than getting deals at big supermarket chains.
When Scott-Cato and her colleagues wrote about the experience of setting up the Stroud Pound, they said it was telling that complementary currencies have been accused of being a game for middle-class people, rather than a genuine economic solution. 

 Perhaps for that reason, experts like Duncan McCann have stopped thinking of complementary currencies as a one-size-fits-all solution. He said they can function as a kind of 'gateway drug' to introduce people to a new way of thinking about money. ""That is especially for those who use it, but also for those who just become aware of it,"" he says. 

 Ciaran Mundy, CEO of the Bristol Pound, says it is important to think of the systemic impact rather than looking for targeted treatment of symptoms of economic deprivation. ""Poverty has many causes,"" he says. ""One of these is how the economy is structured in terms of how money flows out of poor areas due to high dependence on larger national and international companies paying lower wages and using offshore accounts to hide the money from the tax man."" 

 Nothing is tying Glasgow to existing models for complementary currencies. But during the first meeting about setting up the Glasgow Pound, the workshop shows just how hard it would be to invent a new system that works for everyone.  

 Each table is handed a wad of Post-it notes and a piece of white paper. A table leader asks everyone to write on the Post-its what they want the Glasgow Pound to achieve. Elbowing teacups out the way, people get to work. They scrawl a dizzying number of proposals, from keeping more wealth in the local area to empowering people who feel cut out of the national economy, or to moving towards land reform and saving the environment. Team leaders try to assemble these ideas in themes to report back to the room. 

 On one table, Duncan McCann encourages people to urge businesses to do things they have never done before. ""One of the goals should be to move businesses from where they are today into the future,"" he says. 

 After years of researc,h McCann believes the only way complementary currencies can create real value for local economies is if they make transactions happen that wouldn't otherwise have taken place. 

 ""They need to create additional spending power. This is this what the local currencies, despite all their good points, fail to do,"" McCann says.
Every time a Brixton Pound transaction is made, 1.5 per cent goes into a Brixton Fund. This is used to give micro-grants of between a few hundred and £2000 to local projects and community groups. ""We aim to target projects that aren't large enough to apply for more formal grant funding,"" says Lucy Çava, project manager at the Brixton Pound. 

 ""We see this as part of community building – linking the Brixton Pound user with community groups, so both groups become more visible to each other through the currency and fund. This is particularly important in Brixton because of the gentrification debates which are very salient round there,"" Çava says. 

 Meanwhile, the people behind the Bristol Pound are readying a mutual credit network called Bristol Prospects. Through this network, businesses in Bristol can exchange credit in the form of loans that are neutralised within the network, helping one another to grow without relying on the high rates of commercial lenders.  

 Once operational, loans offered through the Prospects network will have negative interest, so that businesses are encouraged to pass credit on as quickly as possible. ""That's the plan,"" says Clarke, ""because it's rather like a hot potato: people will want to pass it on.""  

 ""We know from research that a number of small businesses in Bristol are struggling to get money on reasonable terms,"" says Clarke, ""and that banks are not interested in smaller loans to businesses. So we think there is a strength in the Bristol Pound network to start something like this that is linked, but separate."" 

 Duncan McCann, with all his experience, knows that challenge is worthwhile. ""As people we have a right to make credit and loan money. We mustn't forget that. We mustn't leave that to corporations and the state,"" he says.

64,"New money: Do local currencies actually work?
It's lunchtime at Glasgow Chambers in late November, and Councillor George Redmond is getting worked up at the prospect a Glasgow Pound. ""We would be Glasgow-centric about it,"" he says conspiratorially, as though there is any other way to be. ""Can you imagine having the face of Billy Connolly on our local currency? Or Alex Ferguson, or Kenny Dalglish?"" 

 Inventing an alternative to sterling might sound far-fetched, even illegal. But it's not that strange. In the UK we think of the pound like fish think about water, which is to say not at all. It might never have occurred to many of us that there are other types of exchange that can stand in for ragged bank notes tucked away in pockets, or other objects that can stand in for those notes.  

 Not every country is so lucky. In crisis-hit Greece, where the euro can be hard to come by, businesses and citizens have turned to bartering using a points system where goods like pianos, pot and pans can be exchanged for security services or loaned farming equipment. In India last year, desperate people burned sacks of illegal cash after the government withdrew two high-denomination notes as part of a crackdown on corruption. Hoarders woke up to discover the banknotes under their mattresses were suddenly worthless. 

 The pound has been trading at its lowest level since 1985 since the UK voted to leave the European Union and there are fears that it could dip further as Brexit ensues. Timebanks, local exchange trading systems (LETS) and digital inventions like bitcoin can provide alternative ways for people to pay for goods and services when mainstream currencies hit crises. But they will only work if Britons are ready to accept that they have the power to invent their own currency. 

 ""At the moment, if the pound stops working for us, the whole economy grinds to a halt because there aren't alternatives,"" Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, tells those gathered in a gilded room at Glasgow Chambers to discuss the Glasgow Pound. McCann is a long-time advocate of alternative means of exchange. He is behind the ScotPound, a proposal for a new national currency for Scotland that emerged after the referendum on Scottish independence. It's an idea he no longer thinks will work, because the debate, since Brexit, has shifted from the currency issue back to ideas about Scottish independence.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""

 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a

 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a

 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

Linton lay down his steel fork beside the massively solid transparency
 of the restaurant water glass.


 ""Isn't that Rogers Snead at that table?"" he heard himself say stupidly.


 Howell, the man across the table from him, looked embarrassed without
 looking. ""Not at all. Somebody who looks like him. Twin brother. You
 know how it is. Snead's dead, don't you remember?""


 Linton remembered. Howell had to know that he would remember. What
 were they trying to pull on him? ""The man who isn't Snead is leaving,""
 Linton said, describing the scene over Howell's shoulder. ""If that's
 Snead's brother, I might catch him to pay my respects.""


 ""No,"" Howell said, ""I wouldn't do that.""


 ""Snead came to Greta's funeral. It's the least I could do.""


 ""I wouldn't. Probably no relation to Snead at all. Somebody who looks
 like him.""


 ""He's practically running,"" Linton said. ""He almost ran out of the
 restaurant.""


 ""Who? Oh, the man who looked like Snead, you mean.""


 ""Yes,"" Linton said.


 A thick-bodied man at the next table leaned his groaning chair back
 intimately against Linton's own chair.


 ""That fellow who just left looked like a friend of yours, huh?"" the
 thick man said.


 ""Couldn't have been him, though,"" Linton answered automatically. ""My
 friend's dead.""


 The thick man rocked forward and came down on all six feet. He threw
 paper money on the table as if he were disgusted with it. He plodded
 out of the place quickly.


 Howell breathed in deeply and sucked back Linton's attention. ""Now
 you've probably got old Snead into trouble.""


 ""Snead's dead,"" Linton said.


 ""Oh, well, 'dead,'"" Howell replied.


 ""What do you say it like that for?"" Linton demanded angrily. ""The
 man's dead. Plain dead. He's not Sherlock Holmes or the Frankenstein
 Monster—there's no doubt or semantic leeway to the thing.""


 ""You know how it is,"" Howell said.


 Linton had thought he had known how death was. He had buried his wife,
 or rather he had watched the two workmen scoop and shove dirt in on
 the sawdust-fresh pine box that held the coffin. He had known what he
 sincerely felt to be a genuine affection for Greta. Even after they had
 let him out of the asylum as cured, he still secretly believed he had
 known a genuine affection for her. But it didn't seem he knew about
 death at all.


 Linton felt that his silence was asking Howell by this time.


 ""I don't know, mind you,"" Howell said, puffing out tobacco smoke, ""but
 I suppose he might have been resurrected.""


 ""Who by?"" Linton asked, thinking:
God?
""The Mafia, I guess. Who knows who runs it?""


 ""You mean, somebody has invented a way to bring dead people back to
 life?"" Linton said.
He knew, of course, that Howell did not mean that. Howell meant that
 some people had a system of making it appear that a person had died
 in order to gain some illegal advantage. But by saying something so
 patently ridiculous, Linton hoped to bring the contradicting truth to
 the surface immediately.


 ""An invention? I guess that's how it is,"" Howell agreed. ""I don't know
 much about people like that. I'm an honest businessman.""


 ""But it's wonderful,"" Linton said, thinking his immediate thoughts.
 ""Wonderful! Why should a thing like that be illegal? Why don't I know
 about it?""


 ""Sh-h,"" Howell said uneasily. ""This is a public place.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton said helplessly.


 ""Look, Frank, you can't legalize a thing like resurrection,"" Howell
 said with feigned patience. ""There are strong religious convictions to
 consider. The undertakers have a lobby. I've heard they got spies right
 in the White House, ready to assassinate if they have to. Death is
 their whole life. You got to realize that.""


 ""That's not enough. Not nearly enough.""


 ""Think of all the problems it would cause. Insurance, for one thing.
 Overpopulation. Birth control is a touchy subject. They'd have to take
 it up if everybody got resurrected when they died, wouldn't they?""


 ""But what do they do about it? Against it?""


 ""There are a lot of fakes and quacks in the resurrection business. When
 the cops find out about a place, they break in, smash all the equipment
 and arrest everybody in sight. That's about all they can do. The
 charges, if any, come under general vice classification.""


 ""I don't understand,"" Linton complained. ""Why haven't I heard about it?""


 ""They didn't talk much about white slavery in Victorian England. I read
 an article in
Time
the other day that said 'death' was our dirty
 word, not sex. You want to shock somebody, you tell him, 'You're going
 to be dead someday,' not anything sexual. You know how it is. The
 opposite of 'live' these days is 'video-taped.'""


 ""I see,"" Linton said.


 He tried to assimilate it. Of course he had, he reminded himself, been
 out of touch for some time. It might be true. Then again, they might be
 trying to trick him. They used to do that to see if he was really well.
 But the temptation was too strong.


 ""Tell me, Howell, where could I find a resurrectionist?""


 Howell looked away. ""Frank, I don't have anything to do with that kind
 of people and if you're smart, you'll not either.""


 Linton's fingers imprinted the linen. ""Damn you, Howell, you tell me!""


 Howell climbed to his feet hurriedly. ""I take you out to dinner to
 console you over the loss of your wife a half a year ago, and to make
 you feel welcome back to the society of your fellows after being in the
 hospital for a nervous breakdown. I do all that, and for thanks, you
 yell at me and curse me. You kooks are all alike!""


 Howell threw money on the table with the same kind of disinterest as
 the thick-set man and stalked out.


 I've got to hurry too, Linton thought. It's Resurrection Day!
The doctor fluttered his hands and chirped about the office. ""Well,
 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a

 well, Mr. Linton, we understand you've been causing disturbances.""


 ""Not really,"" Linton said modestly.


 ""Come, come,"" the doctor chided. ""You started riots in two places,
 attempted to bribe an officer. That's disturbing, Mr. Linton, very
 disturbing.""


 ""I was only trying to find out something,"" Linton maintained. ""They
 could have told me. Everybody seems to know but me.""


 The doctor clucked his tongue. ""Let's not think any such thing. People
 don't know more than you do.""


 Linton rubbed his shoulder. ""That cop knew more about Judo holds than I
 did.""


 ""A few specific people know a few specific things you don't. But let me
 ask you, Mr. Linton, could Einstein bake a pie?""


 ""I don't know. Who the hell ever wasted Einstein's time asking him a
 thing like that?""


 ""People who want to know the answers to questions have to ask them. You
 can find out anything by asking the right questions of the right person
 at the right time.""


 Linton stared suspiciously. ""Do you know where I can find a
 resurrectionist?""


 ""I am a resurrectionist.""


 ""But the policeman brought me to you!""


 ""Well, that's what you paid him to do, wasn't it? Did you think a
 policeman would just steal your money? Cynics—all you young people are
 cynics.""


 Linton scooted forward on the insultingly cold metal chair and really
 looked at the doctor for the first time.


 ""Doctor, can you
really
resurrect the dead?""


 ""Will you stop being cynical? Of course I can!""


 ""Doctor, I'm beginning to believe in you,"" Linton said, ""but tell me,
 can you resurrect the
long
dead?""


 ""Size has nothing to do with it.""


 ""No, my wife has been dead a long time. Months.""


 ""Months?"" The doctor snapped those weeks away with his fingers. ""It
 could be years. Centuries. It's all mathematics, my boy. I need only
 one fragment of the body and my computers can compute what the rest
 of it was like and recreate it. It's infallible. Naturally there is a
 degree of risk involved.""


 ""Infallible risk, yes,"" Linton murmured. ""Could you go to work right
 away?""


 ""First, I must follow an ancient medical practice. I must bleed you.""


 Linton grasped the situation immediately. ""You mean you want money. You
 realize I've just got out of an institution....""


 ""I've often been in institutions myself, for alcoholism, narcotics
 addiction and more.""


 ""What a wonderful professional career,"" Linton said, when he couldn't
 care less.


 ""Oh, yes—yes, indeed. But I didn't come out broke.""


 ""Neither did I,"" Linton said hastily. ""I invested in shifty stocks,
 faltering bonds, and while I was away they sank to rock bottom.""


 ""Then—""


 ""When they hit rock bottom, they bounced up. If I hadn't found you, I
 would have been secure for the rest of my lonely, miserable life.""


 ""All that's ended now,"" the doctor assured him. ""Now we must go dig up
 the corpse. The female corpse, eh?""


 Resurrection Day!


 ""Doctor,"" Linton whispered, ""my mind is singing with battalions of
 choirs. I hope that doesn't sound irreverent to you.""


 The doctor stroked his oily palms together. ""Oh, but it does.
 Beautifully.""
The certificate to allow reburial in Virginia hadn't been impossible
 to obtain. The doctor had taken the body and Linton's fortune and fed
 them both into the maw of his calculators, and by means of the secret,
 smuggled formulae, Greta would be cybernetically reborn.


 Linton shook his head. It seemed impossible. But Greta opened the
 olive-drab slab of metal of the door to the doctor's inner-inner
 sanctum and walked out into the medicinal cold fluorescent lighting.


 It wasn't fair at all, Linton thought. He should have had some time to
 prepare himself.


 Greta lifted her arms, stretching the white smock over the lines of her
 body. ""Darling!"" she said.


 ""Greta!"" he said, feeling a slight revulsion but repressing it. No
 doubt he would be able to adjust to her once having been dead the same
 way he had learned to accept the, to him, distasteful duty of kissing
 her ears the way she enjoyed.


 Greta swirled across the room and folded her arms across his shoulders.
 She kissed his cheek. ""It's so wonderful to be back. This calls for a
 celebration. We must see Nancy, Oscar, Johnny, all our old friends.""


 ""Yes,"" he said, his heart lurching for her sad ignorance. ""But tell
 me—how was it being
away
?""


 The curves and angles of her flesh changed their positions against his
 Ivy dacron. Her attitude altered.


 ""I can't remember,"" she said. ""I can't really remember anything. Not
 really. My memories are ghosts....""


 ""Now, now,"" Linton said, ""we mustn't get excited. You've been through a
 trial.""


 She accepted the verdict. She pulled away and touched at her hair. It
 was the same hair, black as evil, contrasting with her inner purity. Of
 course it would be; it hadn't changed even in the grave. He remembered
 the snaky tendrils of it growing out of the water-logged casket.


 ""I must see all our old friends,"" Greta persisted. ""Helen and
 Johnny....""


 ""My darling,"" he said gently, ""about Johnny—""


 Her fine black brows made Gothic arches. ""Yes? What about Johnny?""


 ""It was a terrible accident right after—that is, about five months
 ago. He was killed.""


 ""Killed?"" Greta repeated blankly. ""Johnny Gorman was killed?""


 ""Traffic accident. Killed instantly.""


 ""But Johnny was your friend, your best friend. Why didn't you have him
 resurrected the same way you did me?""


 ""Darling, resurrection is a risky business and an expensive one. You
 have to pay premium prices for strawberries in February. I no longer
 have the money to pay for a resurrection of Johnny.""


 Greta turned her back to him. ""It's just as well. You shouldn't bring
 back Johnny to this dream of life, give him a ghost of mind and the
 photograph of a soul. It's monstrous. No one should do that. No one.
 But you're
sure
you haven't the money to do it?""


 ""No,"" Linton said. ""I'm sold out. I've borrowed on my insurance to the
 hilt. It won't pay any more until I'm buried, and then, of course, you
 can resurrect me.""


 ""Of course,"" Greta said. She sighed. ""Poor Johnny. He was such a good
 friend of yours. You must miss him. I'm so sorry for you.""


 ""I have you,"" he said with great simplicity.


 ""Frank,"" she said, ""you should see that place in there. There are
 foaming acid baths, great whale-toothed disposals, barrels of chemicals
 to quench death and smother decay. It's
perfect
.""


 ""It sounds carnal,"" he said uneasily.


 ""No, dear, it's perfect for some things that have to be done.""


 Her eyes flashed around the doctor's office and settled somewhere, on
 something.


 Linton followed the direction of Greta's gaze and found only an ashtray
 stand, looking vaguely like a fanatic's idol to a heathen religion on a
 pedestal.


 Greta pounced on the stand, hefted it at the base and ran toward him
 with it over her head.


 Linton leaped aside and Greta hit the edge of the desk instead of him.


 Brain damage, he concluded nervously. Cell deterioration.
Greta raised it again and he caught her wrists high over her head. She
 writhed against him provocatively. ""Frank, I'm sorry, dear, but I have
 to have that insurance money. It's hell!""


 Linton understood immediately. He felt foolish, humiliated. All that
 money! He had resurrected a gold ring that had turned his knuckles
 green. No one must ever know.


 Linton twisted the stand away from his wife and watched her face
 in some appalled form of satisfaction as it registered horror and
 acceptance of the crumpled metal disk falling toward it.


 He split her head open and watched her float to the floor.


 Linton was surprised at the fine wire mesh just below the skin and
 those shiny little tabs that looked like pictures of transistors in
 institutional advertising.


 He knelt beside the body and poked into the bleeding, smoldering
 wreckage.


 Yes, it seemed they had to automate and modify the bodies somewhat
 in resurrection. They couldn't chemically revive the old corpse like
 pouring water on a wilted geranium.


 Or—


 Did they use the old bodies at all? What were all those acid baths for
 if the bodies were used? Didn't the resurrectionists just destroy the
 old corpses and make androids, synthetic creatures, to take their place?


 But it didn't matter. Not a bit.


 She had thought she was his wife, sharing her viewpoint down to the
 finest detail, and he had thought she was his wife.


 It was what you thought was real that made it so, not the other way
 around.


 ""I've killed my wife!"" Linton called, rising from his knees, stretching
 his hands out to something.


 The pain stung him to sleep—a pain in his neck like a needle that left
 a hole big enough for a camel to pass through and big enough for him to
 follow the camel in his turn.
He opened his eyes to the doctor's spotless, well-ordered office. The
 doctor looked down at him consolingly. ""You'll have to go back, Mr.
 Linton. But they'll cure you. You'll be cured of ever thinking your
 wife was brought back to life and that you killed her all over again.""


 ""Do you
really
think so, Doctor?"" Linton asked hopefully.

66,"Face value
When the BBC broadcast the recent documentary by Louis Theroux that looked back at the time he spent in the company of Jimmy Savile, there was disbelief across social media that no one had stepped in to stop Savile from committing his crimes. Some blamed the BBC, some blamed those in Savile's immediate circle, but others blamed a simple error of human judgment.  

 ""He literally couldn't look more like a paedophile,"" read one post – one of many to state a supposedly incontrovertible truth: that Savile's criminal tendencies could have been detected from the shape of his features, his eyes, his hair. Moreover, this has nothing to do with the benefit of hindsight and should have been picked up at the time. His looks, they suggested, were a moral indicator, with a wealth of compelling visual evidence to support the claim. 

 We know that paedophiles, murderers and other violent criminals come in many shapes and sizes. If we knew nothing about their criminal history, some of their photos might even appear attractive. But the idea that someone's features betray their character is something rooted deep within us; it's the reason why certain photos perform well on dating apps, or why trustworthy-looking politicians might rack up votes. But how wrong are our hunches of perceived criminality?  

 A recent paper, published by Xiaolin Wu and Xi Zhang of Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, claims to be the first to use machine learning and neural networks to attempt a fully automated inference of criminality from facial images, removing prejudice from the equation and testing the validity of our gut feelings. ""What facial features influence the average Joe's impulsive and yet consensual judgments on social attributes?"" they ask. Through a study of 1,856 images (""controlled for race, gender, age and facial expression"") they claim to have established the validity of ""automated, face-induced inference on criminality, despite the historical controversy surrounding this line of enquiry.""  

 In other words, they believe that they've found a relationship between looking like a criminal and actually being one. 

 It's a claim that's been made many times over the years. Physiognomy, the 'science' of judging people by their appearance, was first theorised by the ancient Greeks in around the 5th century BC. Aristotle's pronouncement that ""it is possible to infer character from features"" led to a number of works relating to 'Physiognomica', a word derived from
physis
(nature),
nomos
(law) and (or)
gnomon
(judge or interpreter).  

 All of Greek society, it was claimed, could benefit from this skill: it could assist with choosing an employee, a slave or a spouse, while its inherent vagueness made it intriguing to philosophers and useful for scientists who bent the theories to support their own beliefs. It became a recognised science in the Islamic world, and was used and taught in Europe throughout late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, despite nagging doubts among thinkers and physicians of the day. In the early 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci claimed not to ""concern myself with false physiognomy, because these chimeras have no scientific foundation."" 

 Theories of physiognomy, however, would persist beyond the Renaissance. In 1586, Italian scholar Giambattista della Porta published a book, De humana physiognomonia libri IIII, which established him as the 'father of Physiognomy'. Della Porta's thinking was based on the 'doctrine of signatures'; the idea that the appearance of plants and animals offers clues to their nature. For example, as one writer of the time suggested, walnuts are good for curing headaches because they're shaped a bit like a human head. The theories in della Porta's book were supported by dozens of detailed illustrations which, by comparing human faces to those of animals, suggested that they must surely share similar character traits.
In the 17th century, Swiss poet Johann Caspar Lavater took della Porta's methodology and ran with it, commissioning artists to illustrate his popular Essays On Physiognomy – which, to the chagrin of his contemporary, the writer Hannah More, sold for ""fifteen guineas a set… while in vain we boast that philosophy [has] broken down all the strongholds of prejudice, ignorance, and superstition."" 

 Lavater's work was criticised for being ridden with bias (black faces rarely emerged well from his analyses) but he was right in one respect: ""Whether they are or are not sensible of it,"" he wrote, ""all men are daily influenced by physiognomy."" 

 Many studies have been done into our psychological response to faces, and it's clear that a so-called halo effect will inevitably work its magic. ""Attractive people are regarded as better at everything,"" says Professor Peter Hancock, lecturer in Psychology at Stirling University. ""And we can't shake that off because there's some truth to it. Good genes produce intelligent people, attractive faces, fit bodies, and we imagine that they're going to be good at everything else, too. We don't have good insight into our own behaviour. We tend to think we understand what we're doing, but we don't."" 

 Hancock describes attending a conference where one speaker showed a series of black faces and white faces to students (who were mostly white) and asked them what they thought the experiment was about. ""They knew that he was trying to assess whether they would rate the black ones as more criminal,"" says Hancock. ""But then they did!"" 

 We attribute social characteristics based on opinions we already hold about certain kinds of faces: whether they look unusual in some way, whether they resemble a partner, a family member or even ourselves, or perhaps have some other cultural association. Physiognomy ultimately stems from what Alexander Todorov, professor of psychology at Princeton University, calls an 'overgeneralisation hypothesis'. ""People,"" he wrote, ""use easily accessible facial information (eg an expression such as a smile, cues to gender and ethnic group) to make social attributions congruent with this information (eg a nice person)."" 

 In a social media age, the pictures we choose to represent ourselves online are a form of self-presentation driven by those social attributions and the knowledge that our pictures are being judged.  

 Experiments at Princeton found that we take less than one tenth of a second to form an opinion of strangers from their pictures, and those opinions tend to stand firm even if we're exposed to those pictures for a longer period of time. That tendency to judge instantly gives rise to a number of selfie tropes that are deemed to elicit positive responses, particularly when it comes to photos on dating profiles: certain angles, particular expressions, minute adjustments of eyebrows and lips that might appear to be about narcissism and vanity, but are more about a fear of being incorrectly assessed. After all, false suppositions based on people's faces are hugely influential within society, and in extreme cases they can have a huge impact on people's lives.  

 When retired teacher Christopher Jefferies was held by police in connection with the murder of Joanna Yeates in Bristol back in 2010, more than half a dozen newspapers gave his unusual appearance particular scrutiny and made assumptions accordingly, which in turn influenced public opinion. This culminated in substantial damages for defamation, two convictions for contempt of court and a painful ordeal for Jefferies, who was entirely innocent. 

 This kind of deep-seated bias looms large throughout physiognomic works of the 19th and 20th centuries, from absurdities such as Vaught's Practical Character Reader of 1902 (handy if you want to find out what a ""deceitful chin"" looks like) to more inherently troubling volumes such as Cesare Lombroso's Criminal Man.  

 After performing a number of autopsies on criminals, the Italian physician claimed to have discovered a number of common characteristics, and it's worth listing them if only to establish the supposed criminality of pretty much everyone you know:
Unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances on head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos; receding hairline; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.
In a woeful misreading of Darwinian theory, Lombroso unwittingly founded the field of anthropological criminology, and more specifically the idea of the born criminal: a hereditary quality that posed a danger to society and must be rooted out. His theories became discredited during the 20th century, but the kind of bias displayed by Lombroso can still be found in legal systems across the world; studies show that people with stereotypically 'untrustworthy' faces tend to receive harsher treatment than those who don't. There's evidently some consensus over people's attitudes toward certain faces, but it doesn't follow that the consensus is correct. 

 The only attributes that we're reasonably good at detecting, according to research done at the University of Michigan in the 1960s and later tested at the University of Stirling in 2007, are extroversion and conscientiousness. For other traits there's insufficient evidence that our hunches are correct, with anomalies explained by our evolved aversion to 'ugliness', established links between broader faces and powerful physiques, or cultural associations with certain demographics which are reinforced with nagging regularity by newspapers, books, television and film. 

 Data-driven studies, based upon huge quantities of facial data, would seem to offer the final word on this. Since 2005, computational models have used various techniques to test for links between social attributes and facial features, resulting in suggestions that our faces can betray, for example, political leanings, sexual orientation and criminality. One BBC Future article from 2015 even describes the 'discipline' of physiognomy as 'gaining credibility'. But Todorov details many problems with these studies, pointing out the challenging nature of doing such experiments with sufficient rigour – not least because different images of the same people can prompt wildly differing results.  

 The aforementioned study at Shanghai's Jiao Tong University, with its enthusiastic, data-driven analyses of such questions as ""What features of a human face betray its owner's propensity for crimes?"" prompted a wave of press coverage.
The vision outlined in these articles is of an unethical dystopia where neural networks can assess our faces and establish a likely score for criminality – but Todorov is scathing about this paper, too. ""The main problem is the sampling of the images,"" he says. ""There is not enough information about the [nature of] the images of the people who were convicted. Second, clearly, there are huge differences between the two samples [of convicts and non-convicts] [in terms of] education and socio-economic status.""
In other words, your appearance is affected by the kind of life you've led, so the classifiers within the computer program are simply distinguishing between different demographics rather than detecting a propensity for criminal behaviour. 

 Todorov is also wary of these classifiers misidentifying more 'innocent' people than identifying actual criminals, and accuracy is a concern shared by Peter Hancock. ""Networks don't assess faces in the same way that we do,"" he says. ""One of our systems, which is a deep network, has a recognition engine which generates an ordered list of how similar various faces are. And sometimes you get good matches – but other times you look at them and say, well, it's the wrong race! To humans they look completely different. And that underlines the fact that the networks are working in a different sort of way, and actually you don't really know how they're working. They're the ultimate black box."" 

 This isn't to say that the use of big data, and particularly the use of composite imagery (digitally blending together certain types of faces) doesn't give us useful information and fascinating correlations. ""You can, for example, take a given face and use computer software to make it look more or less trustworthy,"" says Hancock. ""I remember a colleague playing with this and he made a less trustworthy version of George W Bush – and how shifty did he look! I'm surprised that they're not using these techniques in political advertising, because you couldn't tell that anything had been done [to the picture], but when you look at it you think 'I wouldn't trust him'."" 

 The revitalisation of the theory of physiognomy by the Shanghai students is, according to Todorov, deeply problematic on a theoretical level. ""Are we back to Lombroso's theory,"" he asks, ""that criminals were anomalous creatures, evolutionary degenerates? How does one become criminal, and what role do various life forces play into this? There are people making claims that you just need to look at the face to predict personality and behaviour, but many of these people have not given much thought to their underlying assumptions.""  

 While it's true that we judge books by their covers, covers are more than just faces; we piece together all kinds of cues from people to form our impressions of them. Jimmy Savile's appearance was unusual by any standards, but we absorbed a great deal of information about him over the years that will have influenced our opinions – not least from the original Louis Theroux programme from 2000 that was reexamined in that recent BBC documentary. Savile's vague resemblance to the Child Catcher from the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang is convenient but ultimately misleading, and the way it reinforces the idea of what a paedophile might 'look like' is unfortunate; not least because it helps to sustain a low-level belief in the 'science' of physiognomy, despite its tendency to crumble under the slightest cross examination.

67,"AI: what's the worst that could happen?
The Centre for the Future of Intelligence is seeking to investigate the implications of artificial intelligence for humanity, and make sure humans take advantage of the opportunities while dodging the risks. It launched at the University of Cambridge last October, and is a collaboration between four universities and colleges – Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial and Berkeley – backed with a 10-year, £10m grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

 Because no single discipline is ideally suited to this task, the centre emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It is bringing together a diverse community of some of the world's best researchers, philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists. 

Executive director of the centre is Stephen Cave, a writer, philosopher and former diplomat. Harry Armstrong, head of futures at Nesta, which publishes The Long + Short, spoke with Cave about the impact of AI. 

 Their conversation has been edited.
Harry  Armstrong: Do you see the interdisciplinary nature of the centre as one of its key values and one of the key impacts you hope it will have on the field?
Stephen Cave: Thinking about the impact of AI is not something that any one discipline owns or does in any very systematic way. So if academia is going to rise to the challenge and provide thought leadership on this hugely important issue, then we’re going to need to do it by breaking down current disciplinary boundaries and bringing people with very different expertise together.  

 That means bringing together the technologists and the experts at developing these algorithms together with social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and so forth.  

 I think there are many areas of science where more interdisciplinary engagement would be valuable. Biotech’s another example. In that sense AI isn’t unique, but I think because thinking about AI is still in very early stages, we have an opportunity to shape the way in which we think about it, and build that community. 

 We want to create a space where many different disciplines can come together and develop a shared language, learn from each other’s approaches, and hopefully very quickly move to be able to actually develop new ideas, new conclusions, together. But the first step is learning how to talk to each other.
At a recent talk, Naomi Klein said that addressing the challenge of climate change could not have come at a worse time. The current dominant political and economic ideologies, along with growing isolationist sentiment, runs contrary to the bipartisan, collaborative approaches needed to solve global issues like climate change. Do you see the same issues hampering a global effort to respond to the challenges AI raises?
Climate change suffers from the problem that the costs are not incurred in any direct way by the industrialists who own the technology and are profiting from it. With AI, that has been the case so far; although not on the same scale. There has been disruption but so far, compared to industrialisation, the impact has been fairly small. That will probably change. 

 AI companies, and in particular the big tech companies, are very concerned that this won't go like climate change, but rather it will go like GMOs: that people will have a gut reaction to this technology as soon as the first great swathe of job losses take hold. People speculate that 50m jobs could be lost in the US if trucking is automated, which is conceivable within 10 years. You could imagine a populist US government therefore simply banning driverless cars. 

 So I think there is anxiety in the tech industry that there could be a serious reaction against this technology at any point. And so my impression is that there is a feeling within these companies that these ethical and social implications need to be taken very seriously, now. And that a broad buy-in by society into some kind of vision of the future in which this technology plays a role is required, if a dangerous – or to them dangerous – counteraction is to be avoided.
My personal experience working with these tech companies is that they are concerned for their businesses and genuinely want to do the right thing. Of course there are intellectual challenges and there is money to be made, but equally they are people who don't think when they get up in the morning that they're going to put people out of jobs or bring about the downfall of humanity. As the industry matures it's developing a sense of responsibility. 

 So I think we've got a real opportunity, despite the general climate, and in some ways because of it. There's a great opportunity to bring industry on board to make sure the technology is developed in the right way.
One of the dominant narratives around not only AI but technology and automation more generally is that we, as humans, are at the mercy of technological progress. If you try and push against this idea you can be labelled as being anti-progress and stuck in the past. But we do have a lot more control than we give ourselves credit for. For example, routineness and susceptibility to automation are not inevitable features of occupations, job design is hugely important. How do we design jobs? How do we create jobs that allow people to do the kind of work they want to do? There can be a bit of a conflict between being impacted by what's happening and having some sort of control over what we want to happen.
Certainly, we encounter technological determinism a lot. And it's understandable. For us as individuals, of course it does feel like it always is happening and we just have to cope. No one individual can do much about it, other than adapt. 

 But that's different when we consider ourselves at a level of a society, as a polis [city state], or as an international community. I think we can shape the way in which technology develops. We have various tools. In any given country, we have regulations. There's a possibility of international regulation. 

 Technology is emerging from a certain legal, political, normative, cultural, and social framework. It's coming from a certain place. And it is shaped by all of those things. 

 And I think the more we understand a technology's relationship with those things, and the more we then consciously try to shape those things, the more we are going to influence the technology. So, for example, developing a culture of responsible innovation. For example, a kind of Hippocratic oath for AI developers. These things are within the realms of what is feasible, and I think will help to shape the future.
One of the problems with intervention, generally, is that we cannot control the course of events. We can attempt to, but we don't know how things are going to evolve. The reality is, societies are much too complex for us to be able to shape them in any very specific way, as plenty of ideologies and political movements have found to their cost. There are often unforeseen consequences that can derail a project. 

 I think, nonetheless, there are things we can do. We can try to imagine how things might go very badly wrong, and then work hard to develop systems that will stop that from happening. We can also try collectively to imagine how things could go very right. The kind of society that we actually want to live in that uses this technology. And I'm sure that will be skewed in all sorts of ways, and we might imagine things that seem wonderful and actually have terrible by-products. 

 This conversation cannot be in the hands of any one group. It oughtn't be in the hands of Silicon Valley billionaires alone. They've got their role to play, but this is a conversation we need to be having as widely as possible.
The centre is developing some really interesting projects but perhaps one of the most interesting is the discussion of what intelligence might be. Could you go into a bit more detail about the kinds of questions you are trying to explore in this area?
You mean kinds of intelligence?
Yeah.
I think this is very important because historically, we've had an overwhelming tendency to anthropomorphise. We define what intelligence is, historically, as being human-like. And then within that, being like certain humans. 

 And it's taken a very long time for the academic community to accept that there could be such a thing as non-human intelligence at all. We know that crows, for example, who have had a completely different evolutionary history, or octopuses, who have an even more different evolutionary history, might have a kind of intelligence that's very different to ours. That in some ways rivals our own, and so forth. 

 But luckily, we have got to that point in recent years of accepting that we are not the only form of intelligence. But now, AI is challenging that from a different direction. Just as we are accepting that the natural world offers this enormous range of different intelligences, we are at the same time inventing new intelligences that are radically different to humans. 

 And I think, still, this anthropomorphic picture of the kind of humanoid android, the robot, dominates our idea of what AI is too much. And too many people, and the industry as well, talk about human-level artificial intelligence as a goal, or general AI, which basically means like a human. But actually what we're building is nothing like a human. 

 When the first pocket calculator was made, it didn't do maths like a human. It was vastly better. It didn't make the occasional mistake. When we set about creating these artificial agents to solve these problems, because they have a completely different evolutionary history to humans, they solve problems in very different ways.
And until now, people have been fairly shy about describing them as intelligent. Or rather, in the history of AIs, we think solving a particular problem would require intelligence. Then we solve it. And then that's no longer intelligence, because we've solved it. Chess is a good example. 

 But the reality is, we are creating a whole new world of different artificial agents. And we need to understand that world. We need to understand all the different ways of being clever, if you like. How you can be extremely sophisticated at some particular rational process, and yet extremely bad at another one in a way that bears no relation to the way humans are on these axes. 

 And this is important, partly because we need to expand our sense of what is intelligent, like we have done with the natural world. Because lots of things follow from saying something is intelligent. Historically, we have a long tradition in Western philosophy of saying those who are intelligent should rule. So if intelligence equates to power, then obviously we need to think about what we mean by intelligence. Who has it and who doesn't. Or how it equates to rights and responsibilities. 

 It certainly is a very ambitious project to create the atlas of intelligence.
There was a point I read in something you wrote on our ideas of intelligence that I thought was very interesting. We actually tend to think of intelligence at the societal level when we think about human ability, rather than at the individual level but in the end conflate the two. I think that's a very good point, when we think about our capabilities, we think about what we can achieve as a whole, not individually. But when we talk about AI, we tend to think about that individual piece of technology, or that individual system. So for example if we think about the internet of things and AI, we should discuss intelligence as something encompassed by the whole.
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, right now, perhaps it is a product of our anthropomorphising bias. But there is a tendency to see a narrative of AI versus humanity, as if it's one or the other. And yet, obviously, there are risks in this technology long before it acquires any kind of manipulative agency. 

 Robotic technology is dangerous. Or potentially dangerous. But at the same time, most of what we're using technology for is to enhance ourselves, to increase our capacities. And a lot of what AI is going to be doing is augmenting us – we're going to be working as teams, AI-human teams.
Where do you think this AI-human conflict, or concept of a conflict, comes from? Do you think that's just a reflection of historical conversations we've had about automation, or do you think it is a deeper fear?
I do think it comes both from some biases that might well be innate, such as anthropomorphism, or our human tendency to ascribe agency to other objects, particularly moving ones, is well-established and probably has sound evolutionary roots. If it moves, it's probably wise to start asking yourself questions like, ""What is it? What might it want? Where might it be going? Might it be hungry? Do I look like food to it?"" I think it makes sense, it's natural for us to think in terms of agency. And when we do, it's natural for us to project our own ways of being and acting. And we, as primates, are profoundly co-operative. 

 But at the same time, we're competitive and murderous. We have a strong sense of in-group versus out-group, which is responsible for both a great deal of cooperation, within the in-group, but also terrible crimes. Murder, rape, pillage, genocide; and they're pointed at the out-group. 

 And so I think it's very natural for us to see AIs in terms of agents. We anthropomorphise them as these kind of android robots. And then we think about, well, you know, are they part of our in-group, or are they some other group? If they're some other group, it's us against them. Who's going to win? Well, let's see. So I think that's very natural, I think that's very human.
There is this long tradition, in Western culture in particular, with associating intelligence and dominance and power. It's interesting to speculate about how, and I wish I knew more about it, and I'd like to see more research on this, about how different cultures perceive AI. It's well known that Japan is very accepting of technology and robots, for example. 

 You can think, well, we in the West have long been justifying power relations of a certain kind on the basis that we're 'cleverer'. That's why men get to vote and women don't, or whatever. In a culture where power is not based on intelligence but, say, on a caste system, which is purely hereditary, we’d build an AI, and it would just tune in, drop out, attain enlightenment, just sit in the corner. Or we beg it to come back and help us find enlightenment. It might be that we find a completely different narrative to the one that's dominant in the West.
One of the projects the centre is running is looking into what kind of AI breakthroughs may come, when and what the social consequences could be. What do you think the future holds? What are your fears – what do you think could go right and wrong in the short, medium and long term?
That's a big question. Certainly I don't lie awake at night worried that robots are going to knock the door down and come in with a machine gun. If the robots take over the world, it won't be by knocking the door down. At the moment, I think it's certainly as big a risk that we have a GMO moment, and there's a powerful reaction against the technology which prevents us from reaping the benefits, which are enormous. I think that's as big a risk as the risks from the technologies themselves. 

 I think one worry that we haven't talked about is that we've become extremely dependent  upon this technology. And that we essentially become deskilled. There's an extent to which the history of civilisation is the history of the domestication of the human species sort of by ourselves, and also by our technology, to some extent. And AI certainly allows for that to reach a whole new level. 

 Just think about GPs with diagnostic tools. Even now, my GP consults the computer fairly regularly. But as diagnostic tools get better, what are they going to be doing other than just typing something into the computer and reading out what comes back? At which point, you might as well do away with the GP. But then, who does know about medicine? 

 And so we do need to worry about deskilling and about becoming dependent. And it is entirely possible that you can imagine a society in which we're all sort of prosperous, in a sense. Our basic bodily needs are provided for, perhaps, in a way, to an extent that we've never before even dreamed of. Unprecedented in human history. 

 And yet, we're stripped of any kind of meaningful work. We have no purpose. We're escaping to virtual reality. And then you could imagine all sorts of worrying countercultures or Luddite movements or what have you. I guess that's the kind of scenario that – I haven't sketched it terribly well – but that's the kind of thing that worries me more than missile-toting giant robots. 

 As to utopian, yes, that's interesting. I certainly mentioned a couple of things. One thing that I hope is that this new technological revolution enables us to undo some of the damage of the last one. That's a very utopian thought and not terribly realistic, but we use fossil fuels so incredibly efficiently. The idea that driverless cars that are shared, basically a kind of shared service located off a Brownfield site does away with 95 per cent of all cars, freeing up a huge amount of space in the city to be greener, many fewer cars need to be produced, they would be on the road much less, there'd be fewer traffic jams. 

 It's just one example, but the idea that we can live much more resource-efficiently, because we are living more intelligently through using these tools. And therefore can undo some of the damage of the last Industrial Revolution. That's my main utopian hope, I guess.

67,"AI: what's the worst that could happen?
The Centre for the Future of Intelligence is seeking to investigate the implications of artificial intelligence for humanity, and make sure humans take advantage of the opportunities while dodging the risks. It launched at the University of Cambridge last October, and is a collaboration between four universities and colleges – Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial and Berkeley – backed with a 10-year, £10m grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

 Because no single discipline is ideally suited to this task, the centre emphasises the importance of interdisciplinary knowledge-sharing and collaboration. It is bringing together a diverse community of some of the world's best researchers, philosophers, psychologists, lawyers and computer scientists. 

Executive director of the centre is Stephen Cave, a writer, philosopher and former diplomat. Harry Armstrong, head of futures at Nesta, which publishes The Long + Short, spoke with Cave about the impact of AI. 

 Their conversation has been edited.
Harry  Armstrong: Do you see the interdisciplinary nature of the centre as one of its key values and one of the key impacts you hope it will have on the field?
Stephen Cave: Thinking about the impact of AI is not something that any one discipline owns or does in any very systematic way. So if academia is going to rise to the challenge and provide thought leadership on this hugely important issue, then we’re going to need to do it by breaking down current disciplinary boundaries and bringing people with very different expertise together.  

 That means bringing together the technologists and the experts at developing these algorithms together with social scientists, philosophers, legal scholars and so forth.  

 I think there are many areas of science where more interdisciplinary engagement would be valuable. Biotech’s another example. In that sense AI isn’t unique, but I think because thinking about AI is still in very early stages, we have an opportunity to shape the way in which we think about it, and build that community. 

 We want to create a space where many different disciplines can come together and develop a shared language, learn from each other’s approaches, and hopefully very quickly move to be able to actually develop new ideas, new conclusions, together. But the first step is learning how to talk to each other.
At a recent talk, Naomi Klein said that addressing the challenge of climate change could not have come at a worse time. The current dominant political and economic ideologies, along with growing isolationist sentiment, runs contrary to the bipartisan, collaborative approaches needed to solve global issues like climate change. Do you see the same issues hampering a global effort to respond to the challenges AI raises?
Climate change suffers from the problem that the costs are not incurred in any direct way by the industrialists who own the technology and are profiting from it. With AI, that has been the case so far; although not on the same scale. There has been disruption but so far, compared to industrialisation, the impact has been fairly small. That will probably change. 

 AI companies, and in particular the big tech companies, are very concerned that this won't go like climate change, but rather it will go like GMOs: that people will have a gut reaction to this technology as soon as the first great swathe of job losses take hold. People speculate that 50m jobs could be lost in the US if trucking is automated, which is conceivable within 10 years. You could imagine a populist US government therefore simply banning driverless cars. 

 So I think there is anxiety in the tech industry that there could be a serious reaction against this technology at any point. And so my impression is that there is a feeling within these companies that these ethical and social implications need to be taken very seriously, now. And that a broad buy-in by society into some kind of vision of the future in which this technology plays a role is required, if a dangerous – or to them dangerous – counteraction is to be avoided.
My personal experience working with these tech companies is that they are concerned for their businesses and genuinely want to do the right thing. Of course there are intellectual challenges and there is money to be made, but equally they are people who don't think when they get up in the morning that they're going to put people out of jobs or bring about the downfall of humanity. As the industry matures it's developing a sense of responsibility. 

 So I think we've got a real opportunity, despite the general climate, and in some ways because of it. There's a great opportunity to bring industry on board to make sure the technology is developed in the right way.
One of the dominant narratives around not only AI but technology and automation more generally is that we, as humans, are at the mercy of technological progress. If you try and push against this idea you can be labelled as being anti-progress and stuck in the past. But we do have a lot more control than we give ourselves credit for. For example, routineness and susceptibility to automation are not inevitable features of occupations, job design is hugely important. How do we design jobs? How do we create jobs that allow people to do the kind of work they want to do? There can be a bit of a conflict between being impacted by what's happening and having some sort of control over what we want to happen.
Certainly, we encounter technological determinism a lot. And it's understandable. For us as individuals, of course it does feel like it always is happening and we just have to cope. No one individual can do much about it, other than adapt. 

 But that's different when we consider ourselves at a level of a society, as a polis [city state], or as an international community. I think we can shape the way in which technology develops. We have various tools. In any given country, we have regulations. There's a possibility of international regulation. 

 Technology is emerging from a certain legal, political, normative, cultural, and social framework. It's coming from a certain place. And it is shaped by all of those things. 

 And I think the more we understand a technology's relationship with those things, and the more we then consciously try to shape those things, the more we are going to influence the technology. So, for example, developing a culture of responsible innovation. For example, a kind of Hippocratic oath for AI developers. These things are within the realms of what is feasible, and I think will help to shape the future.
One of the problems with intervention, generally, is that we cannot control the course of events. We can attempt to, but we don't know how things are going to evolve. The reality is, societies are much too complex for us to be able to shape them in any very specific way, as plenty of ideologies and political movements have found to their cost. There are often unforeseen consequences that can derail a project. 

 I think, nonetheless, there are things we can do. We can try to imagine how things might go very badly wrong, and then work hard to develop systems that will stop that from happening. We can also try collectively to imagine how things could go very right. The kind of society that we actually want to live in that uses this technology. And I'm sure that will be skewed in all sorts of ways, and we might imagine things that seem wonderful and actually have terrible by-products. 

 This conversation cannot be in the hands of any one group. It oughtn't be in the hands of Silicon Valley billionaires alone. They've got their role to play, but this is a conversation we need to be having as widely as possible.
The centre is developing some really interesting projects but perhaps one of the most interesting is the discussion of what intelligence might be. Could you go into a bit more detail about the kinds of questions you are trying to explore in this area?
You mean kinds of intelligence?
Yeah.
I think this is very important because historically, we've had an overwhelming tendency to anthropomorphise. We define what intelligence is, historically, as being human-like. And then within that, being like certain humans. 

 And it's taken a very long time for the academic community to accept that there could be such a thing as non-human intelligence at all. We know that crows, for example, who have had a completely different evolutionary history, or octopuses, who have an even more different evolutionary history, might have a kind of intelligence that's very different to ours. That in some ways rivals our own, and so forth. 

 But luckily, we have got to that point in recent years of accepting that we are not the only form of intelligence. But now, AI is challenging that from a different direction. Just as we are accepting that the natural world offers this enormous range of different intelligences, we are at the same time inventing new intelligences that are radically different to humans. 

 And I think, still, this anthropomorphic picture of the kind of humanoid android, the robot, dominates our idea of what AI is too much. And too many people, and the industry as well, talk about human-level artificial intelligence as a goal, or general AI, which basically means like a human. But actually what we're building is nothing like a human. 

 When the first pocket calculator was made, it didn't do maths like a human. It was vastly better. It didn't make the occasional mistake. When we set about creating these artificial agents to solve these problems, because they have a completely different evolutionary history to humans, they solve problems in very different ways.
And until now, people have been fairly shy about describing them as intelligent. Or rather, in the history of AIs, we think solving a particular problem would require intelligence. Then we solve it. And then that's no longer intelligence, because we've solved it. Chess is a good example. 

 But the reality is, we are creating a whole new world of different artificial agents. And we need to understand that world. We need to understand all the different ways of being clever, if you like. How you can be extremely sophisticated at some particular rational process, and yet extremely bad at another one in a way that bears no relation to the way humans are on these axes. 

 And this is important, partly because we need to expand our sense of what is intelligent, like we have done with the natural world. Because lots of things follow from saying something is intelligent. Historically, we have a long tradition in Western philosophy of saying those who are intelligent should rule. So if intelligence equates to power, then obviously we need to think about what we mean by intelligence. Who has it and who doesn't. Or how it equates to rights and responsibilities. 

 It certainly is a very ambitious project to create the atlas of intelligence.
There was a point I read in something you wrote on our ideas of intelligence that I thought was very interesting. We actually tend to think of intelligence at the societal level when we think about human ability, rather than at the individual level but in the end conflate the two. I think that's a very good point, when we think about our capabilities, we think about what we can achieve as a whole, not individually. But when we talk about AI, we tend to think about that individual piece of technology, or that individual system. So for example if we think about the internet of things and AI, we should discuss intelligence as something encompassed by the whole.
Yeah, absolutely. Yes, right now, perhaps it is a product of our anthropomorphising bias. But there is a tendency to see a narrative of AI versus humanity, as if it's one or the other. And yet, obviously, there are risks in this technology long before it acquires any kind of manipulative agency.

Yeah, absolutely. Yes, right now, perhaps it is a product of our anthropomorphising bias. But there is a tendency to see a narrative of AI versus humanity, as if it's one or the other. And yet, obviously, there are risks in this technology long before it acquires any kind of manipulative agency. 

 Robotic technology is dangerous. Or potentially dangerous. But at the same time, most of what we're using technology for is to enhance ourselves, to increase our capacities. And a lot of what AI is going to be doing is augmenting us – we're going to be working as teams, AI-human teams.
Where do you think this AI-human conflict, or concept of a conflict, comes from? Do you think that's just a reflection of historical conversations we've had about automation, or do you think it is a deeper fear?
I do think it comes both from some biases that might well be innate, such as anthropomorphism, or our human tendency to ascribe agency to other objects, particularly moving ones, is well-established and probably has sound evolutionary roots. If it moves, it's probably wise to start asking yourself questions like, ""What is it? What might it want? Where might it be going? Might it be hungry? Do I look like food to it?"" I think it makes sense, it's natural for us to think in terms of agency. And when we do, it's natural for us to project our own ways of being and acting. And we, as primates, are profoundly co-operative. 

 But at the same time, we're competitive and murderous. We have a strong sense of in-group versus out-group, which is responsible for both a great deal of cooperation, within the in-group, but also terrible crimes. Murder, rape, pillage, genocide; and they're pointed at the out-group. 

 And so I think it's very natural for us to see AIs in terms of agents. We anthropomorphise them as these kind of android robots. And then we think about, well, you know, are they part of our in-group, or are they some other group? If they're some other group, it's us against them. Who's going to win? Well, let's see. So I think that's very natural, I think that's very human.
There is this long tradition, in Western culture in particular, with associating intelligence and dominance and power. It's interesting to speculate about how, and I wish I knew more about it, and I'd like to see more research on this, about how different cultures perceive AI. It's well known that Japan is very accepting of technology and robots, for example. 

 You can think, well, we in the West have long been justifying power relations of a certain kind on the basis that we're 'cleverer'. That's why men get to vote and women don't, or whatever. In a culture where power is not based on intelligence but, say, on a caste system, which is purely hereditary, we’d build an AI, and it would just tune in, drop out, attain enlightenment, just sit in the corner. Or we beg it to come back and help us find enlightenment. It might be that we find a completely different narrative to the one that's dominant in the West.
One of the projects the centre is running is looking into what kind of AI breakthroughs may come, when and what the social consequences could be. What do you think the future holds? What are your fears – what do you think could go right and wrong in the short, medium and long term?
That's a big question. Certainly I don't lie awake at night worried that robots are going to knock the door down and come in with a machine gun. If the robots take over the world, it won't be by knocking the door down. At the moment, I think it's certainly as big a risk that we have a GMO moment, and there's a powerful reaction against the technology which prevents us from reaping the benefits, which are enormous. I think that's as big a risk as the risks from the technologies themselves. 

 I think one worry that we haven't talked about is that we've become extremely dependent  upon this technology. And that we essentially become deskilled. There's an extent to which the history of civilisation is the history of the domestication of the human species sort of by ourselves, and also by our technology, to some extent. And AI certainly allows for that to reach a whole new level. 

 Just think about GPs with diagnostic tools. Even now, my GP consults the computer fairly regularly. But as diagnostic tools get better, what are they going to be doing other than just typing something into the computer and reading out what comes back? At which point, you might as well do away with the GP. But then, who does know about medicine? 

 And so we do need to worry about deskilling and about becoming dependent. And it is entirely possible that you can imagine a society in which we're all sort of prosperous, in a sense. Our basic bodily needs are provided for, perhaps, in a way, to an extent that we've never before even dreamed of. Unprecedented in human history. 

 And yet, we're stripped of any kind of meaningful work. We have no purpose. We're escaping to virtual reality. And then you could imagine all sorts of worrying countercultures or Luddite movements or what have you. I guess that's the kind of scenario that – I haven't sketched it terribly well – but that's the kind of thing that worries me more than missile-toting giant robots. 

 As to utopian, yes, that's interesting. I certainly mentioned a couple of things. One thing that I hope is that this new technological revolution enables us to undo some of the damage of the last one. That's a very utopian thought and not terribly realistic, but we use fossil fuels so incredibly efficiently. The idea that driverless cars that are shared, basically a kind of shared service located off a Brownfield site does away with 95 per cent of all cars, freeing up a huge amount of space in the city to be greener, many fewer cars need to be produced, they would be on the road much less, there'd be fewer traffic jams. 

 It's just one example, but the idea that we can live much more resource-efficiently, because we are living more intelligently through using these tools. And therefore can undo some of the damage of the last Industrial Revolution. That's my main utopian hope, I guess.

68,"What cities in the post-Brexit era could learn from a 14th-century trading bloc
As you fly from the country now known as Germany to Britain, the coastal geography of northern European cities gently unfurls. You can see where the sea smacks into them, or where yawning estuaries unfold like funnels between green and brown city and choppy blue water. You can track the snaking rivers and canals that form unrepentant umbilical connections to the settlements set a little further inland.  

 By their nature cities along coasts and rivers developed so they could be open to trade with each other. From the middle of the 13th century, and for some 300 years after, many settlements dotted along this route formed the prosperous Hanseatic League, a European trading confederation of market towns, before the rise of the nation state led to its dissolution. 

 The Hanseatic League is not well known, and today it lives on most prominently in the name of the German national airline Lufthansa, literally the 'Hansa of the skies', whose planes you can look out of – and down towards the Hanseatic cities – on the short journeys between mainland Europe and Britain. The letters HH on the number plates of cars in Hamburg stand for Hansestadt Hamburg: another proud little memory of this hidden history. 

 In the traumatised atmosphere of post-Brexit Britain, it is worth remembering the Hanseatic League. It could point us towards new relationships between progressive city dwellers in a world that otherwise seems to be putting the brakes on modernity. 

 Despite some of Britain's Leave voters longing to inhabit a fantastical realm immune to foreign influence, the reality is patently very different to that. In the late 1300s, Chaucer wrote about characters travelling to Jerusalem, and others who came from Europe; and it was at exactly this point that the Hanseatic League slowly started to coalesce, eventually influencing our isles. 

 The League is most easily understood as a loose federation of cities that acted together in self-interest to promote trade. The Hanseatic cities developed their own legal system, and their armies came to one another's aid. Merchants who wanted to buy and sell and travel were taking the lead at a time when nation states were not fit for purpose: in the case of England or Denmark, leadership was too centralised and authoritarian, while in German-speaking lands a nation had yet to be formed.  

 We think of nations today as elemental almost, immovable. Yet look at any city of Mitteleuropa and you'll see the many different names it has had as borders and regimes have shifted with the sands of time. Nations come and go. Cities endure.  

 ""It is often said that great cities survived great empires,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, editor-in-chief of the Rotterdam-based online publishing platform Amateur Cities. ""So it is not unrealistic to think of cities as discrete entities that compete and collaborate with each other, independently from the states to which they belong."" 

 The cities involved in the Hanseatic League are found along the Baltic and North Sea coasts, and slightly inland too. The League stretched from Novgorod in the east – in what is now Russia – to London in the west. Tallinn, Riga, Gdańsk, Visby, Berlin, Cologne, Antwerp, Stockholm, Bergen, Kiel, Rostock, Dinant, Bruges, Turku, Groningen, Hanover, Wroclaw, Kaliningrad: all were involved at different stages in the Hanse's history, which ran on into the 1500s.  

 The League covered lands that today find themselves a part of the modern nations of Finland, Sweden, Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Norway, Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. It was a huge – and hugely ambitious – undertaking in the days when communications consisted of ink and paper and the only viable method of travel was by ship. Wood, fur, wool, silver, herring, cod and salt were the main items traded. But what was also exchanged was knowledge. In some ways it was an exercise in what we today call 'soft diplomacy'. There was no maniacal ruler overseeing things – merchants met and talked. They raised armies and waged war against kings who threatened their businesses and their freedoms and their peace.
There was a kind of proto-democracy at work. Professor Rainer Postel, of the Bundeswehr Universität (Germany's equivalent of Sandhurst military academy), has described the Hanse as ""a community of interests without power politics"". As David Abulafia, Professor of Mediterranean History at Cambridge points out, ""The lack of an elaborate superstructure was one of the things that made the Hanse work. Having said that, one should recognise that Lübeck in particular dominated the League for long periods.""  

 Lübeck was where the merchants most often met; and where renewed recent interest in the Hanse eventually led to Angela Merkel cutting the ribbon at the brand new European Hansemuseum in the city last year.
Germany today – multicultural, economically and culturally motoring, free and fair – seems like the ideal model for a modern European nation state. And part of that success lies in the gravitas the country has given to its Hanseatic history. For Germany is not a top-down country with one city unhealthily dominating as with France and Britain (regional economic inequalities have plagued Britain since the painful de-industrialisation of the 1980s, especially in the north). Germany respects federalism and its cities exist on a much more even keel. The way that Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart all bring varied economic and cultural character to the party is pure Hanse. The former Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen have city state status within Germany, putting them on the same level as a whole region or 'land' like Bavaria or Brandenburg. 

 So how about a new Hanseatic League? I ask Benjamin Barber, senior fellow at New York's Fordham University. ""I believe you will find there is a new Hanse,"" he says, ""that constituted itself about 10 or 11 years ago – including many of the original Hanseatic League cities."" Barber is founder of the Global Parliament of Mayors, which he describes as a kind of Hanse of all cities, not just European ports, which will give cities a global urban voice and a common platform for action. The parliament convenes for its inaugural session in The Hague in September. 

 ""Cities both exist within nations and transcend nations. Their power lies not just in the extent of
de jure
autonomy ceded or granted by 'higher' levels of government,"" says Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Washington DC thinktank the Brookings Institution. ""Rather, cities have de facto power, the result of larger market and demographic forces and environmental imperatives that value proximity, density, connectivity and quality. Smart nations will see themselves as partners to their cities, setting strong platforms for urban prosperity and devolving powers, where appropriate, to give cities the flexibility to perform… Dumb nations will continue to dictate from above, stifling market activity and urban potential."" 

 But could we go further? Could cities like London declare independence from the UK? London's economy is larger than that of Scotland and Wales combined. ""States will not vanish or surrender their waning sovereignty,"" says Benjamin Barber. ""But cities will meet across frontiers and work together to solve problems. The objective is not an independent London or New York, but interdependent cities collaborating globally. And that is happening."" 

 London's voters largely wanted to remain a part of the EU and to maintain the city's status as an entrepôt. There is clearly a widening chasm between urban and rural life at the heart of many nations. Visualisations of Austria's recent presidential election showed the issue clearly: the country's cities voted for the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, while the the rural districts went for right-wing nationalist Norbert Hofer (whose legal challenge to the close result has resulted in a rerun being announced for October). And in the USA in November, it's likely that Trump voters will also come from rural areas and Clinton voters from the cities. City dwellers are finding ever more in common with the world's other city dwellers than with their countrymen 50 miles down the road. 

 Back in Britain, one of history's little oddities pops up on the east coast. Boston in Lincolnshire and King's Lynn in Norfolk were both forward-looking Hanseatic League towns that traded with far-flung ports and hosted foreign merchants. King's Lynn contains the only extantHanse House left in Britain (London's was knocked down to build Cannon Street Station in the 1800s). Yet in the EU referendum these two areas polled among the highest Leave votes of anywhere in the country. 

 ""Things change,"" says LSE's Professor Tony Travers. ""[King's Lynn] used to be very highly connected, but the economy moved on and left those trading ports like it in a different situation."" Take, for example, the pivot towards the New World, with which trade made more sense from the west-coast ports like Bristol and Liverpool. While these boomed between the 1600s and 1800s, the Hanseatic ports declined and then died out. ""One of the things that's interesting about the [referendum] decision is that it begs all sorts of questions about the future of the UK and its relationship with Europe; and of London and Scotland and their relationship with the rest of Europe. When the EU began as the EEC in the mid-20th century some saw it as a modern day Hanse. Now the EU seems to be waning, perhaps its successor will have to ape the Hanse even more."" 

 For all its complex beauty, life can ultimately be reduced to a series of binary options: yes or no, stick or twist, in or out, innovation or stagnation, modernity or mythology. The referendum result was disappointing for many progressive observers because it felt like a step backwards. Despite being primarily about trade monopolies and money making, the Hanse was, in its way, an early stab at stepping forwards: it encompassed internationalism, rational thought, free trade, loose democratic institutions and, most crucially of all, movement. 

 The future, for many observers, can only be understood in terms of the free movement of people, capital, goods and ideas. It is this necessary movement, and its possible curtailment, that could be the spark that leads to cities like London to seek independence and parity with other world cities – rather than with the rural hinterlands of Britain. 

 Of course, cities seceding from their nation states would provide huge headaches for countries whose biggest economic driver had been removed – as well as likely deepening ideological differences between city and rural dwellers. Moreover, cities need the food the countryside provides.  

 Yet for all the potential pitfalls, city states can thrive. Look at Singapore, Hong Kong, or de facto city states like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. One of the most telling characteristics about these four – all of course former British imperial enclaves – is that they are utterly outward looking. To return to the sky analogy, it's the airlines of each of these (Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Etihad) that open up each respective city to the world in the way that the machinery of the Hanse did on the Baltic Sea 600 years ago. And it's the unions each city makes with other places that also look thoroughly Hanseatic in character. A model for modern city states, then. But is it one that we want? 

 ""The Hanseatic League was not always accepted by local citizens,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, ""because the privileges granted to the Hanse merchants were forcing local traders out of competition and many cities took steps to eliminate them. The reasons the countryside is turning to the right [globally] are not independent from cities turning increasingly into speculation machines for the profit of a happy few. It is basically these systemic contradictions that must be addressed before we resort to more isolationist ideas that would intensify the urban-rural political divide. The bottom line is not whether a contemporary Hanse-esque federation is possible, it probably is; but whether it is actually desirable.""

And part of that success lies in the gravitas the country has given to its Hanseatic history. For Germany is not a top-down country with one city unhealthily dominating as with France and Britain (regional economic inequalities have plagued Britain since the painful de-industrialisation of the 1980s, especially in the north). Germany respects federalism and its cities exist on a much more even keel. The way that Cologne, Munich, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf and Stuttgart all bring varied economic and cultural character to the party is pure Hanse. The former Hanseatic cities of Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen have city state status within Germany, putting them on the same level as a whole region or 'land' like Bavaria or Brandenburg. 

 So how about a new Hanseatic League? I ask Benjamin Barber, senior fellow at New York's Fordham University. ""I believe you will find there is a new Hanse,"" he says, ""that constituted itself about 10 or 11 years ago – including many of the original Hanseatic League cities."" Barber is founder of the Global Parliament of Mayors, which he describes as a kind of Hanse of all cities, not just European ports, which will give cities a global urban voice and a common platform for action. The parliament convenes for its inaugural session in The Hague in September. 

 ""Cities both exist within nations and transcend nations. Their power lies not just in the extent of
de jure
autonomy ceded or granted by 'higher' levels of government,"" says Bruce Katz, centennial scholar at the Washington DC thinktank the Brookings Institution. ""Rather, cities have de facto power, the result of larger market and demographic forces and environmental imperatives that value proximity, density, connectivity and quality. Smart nations will see themselves as partners to their cities, setting strong platforms for urban prosperity and devolving powers, where appropriate, to give cities the flexibility to perform… Dumb nations will continue to dictate from above, stifling market activity and urban potential."" 

 But could we go further? Could cities like London declare independence from the UK? London's economy is larger than that of Scotland and Wales combined. ""States will not vanish or surrender their waning sovereignty,"" says Benjamin Barber. ""But cities will meet across frontiers and work together to solve problems. The objective is not an independent London or New York, but interdependent cities collaborating globally. And that is happening."" 

 London's voters largely wanted to remain a part of the EU and to maintain the city's status as an entrepôt. There is clearly a widening chasm between urban and rural life at the heart of many nations. Visualisations of Austria's recent presidential election showed the issue clearly: the country's cities voted for the Green candidate Alexander Van der Bellen, while the the rural districts went for right-wing nationalist Norbert Hofer (whose legal challenge to the close result has resulted in a rerun being announced for October). And in the USA in November, it's likely that Trump voters will also come from rural areas and Clinton voters from the cities. City dwellers are finding ever more in common with the world's other city dwellers than with their countrymen 50 miles down the road. 

 Back in Britain, one of history's little oddities pops up on the east coast. Boston in Lincolnshire and King's Lynn in Norfolk were both forward-looking Hanseatic League towns that traded with far-flung ports and hosted foreign merchants. King's Lynn contains the only extantHanse House left in Britain (London's was knocked down to build Cannon Street Station in the 1800s). Yet in the EU referendum these two areas polled among the highest Leave votes of anywhere in the country. 

 ""Things change,"" says LSE's Professor Tony Travers. ""[King's Lynn] used to be very highly connected, but the economy moved on and left those trading ports like it in a different situation."" Take, for example, the pivot towards the New World, with which trade made more sense from the west-coast ports like Bristol and Liverpool. While these boomed between the 1600s and 1800s, the Hanseatic ports declined and then died out. ""One of the things that's interesting about the [referendum] decision is that it begs all sorts of questions about the future of the UK and its relationship with Europe; and of London and Scotland and their relationship with the rest of Europe. When the EU began as the EEC in the mid-20th century some saw it as a modern day Hanse. Now the EU seems to be waning, perhaps its successor will have to ape the Hanse even more."" 

 For all its complex beauty, life can ultimately be reduced to a series of binary options: yes or no, stick or twist, in or out, innovation or stagnation, modernity or mythology. The referendum result was disappointing for many progressive observers because it felt like a step backwards. Despite being primarily about trade monopolies and money making, the Hanse was, in its way, an early stab at stepping forwards: it encompassed internationalism, rational thought, free trade, loose democratic institutions and, most crucially of all, movement. 

 The future, for many observers, can only be understood in terms of the free movement of people, capital, goods and ideas. It is this necessary movement, and its possible curtailment, that could be the spark that leads to cities like London to seek independence and parity with other world cities – rather than with the rural hinterlands of Britain. 

 Of course, cities seceding from their nation states would provide huge headaches for countries whose biggest economic driver had been removed – as well as likely deepening ideological differences between city and rural dwellers. Moreover, cities need the food the countryside provides.  

 Yet for all the potential pitfalls, city states can thrive. Look at Singapore, Hong Kong, or de facto city states like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. One of the most telling characteristics about these four – all of course former British imperial enclaves – is that they are utterly outward looking. To return to the sky analogy, it's the airlines of each of these (Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Emirates and Etihad) that open up each respective city to the world in the way that the machinery of the Hanse did on the Baltic Sea 600 years ago. And it's the unions each city makes with other places that also look thoroughly Hanseatic in character. A model for modern city states, then. But is it one that we want? 

 ""The Hanseatic League was not always accepted by local citizens,"" says Cristina Ampatzidou, ""because the privileges granted to the Hanse merchants were forcing local traders out of competition and many cities took steps to eliminate them. The reasons the countryside is turning to the right [globally] are not independent from cities turning increasingly into speculation machines for the profit of a happy few. It is basically these systemic contradictions that must be addressed before we resort to more isolationist ideas that would intensify the urban-rural political divide. The bottom line is not whether a contemporary Hanse-esque federation is possible, it probably is; but whether it is actually desirable.""

It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present. 

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present.

The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

70,"Just another free soul
In his foreword to the book, Lessig writes that you understand your subjects “by learning to see them in a certain way.” What is that certain way?
I think I’m trying to get a mental image of a person, certain
 expressions, or what I think that person is about. I’m trying to capture
 what I think they look like, which is many times a minority of their
 typical expressions, or their typical stance. So, if I’m taking pictures
 of Larry [Lessig], I want to have his signature hand gestures, and not
 just random ones.
I think I’m trying to capture pictures of people that help others see
 what they’re about. Some photographers will make someone look the way
 the photographer wants them to look, and not the way they appear, so
 they’ll pick the one picture out of 100 where the guy looks more
 egotistical than he really is. Some photographers are almost medical,
 and are going after a perfect portrait. I’m somewhere in between.
It’s amazing how many people will upload snapshots of people where the
 pictures don’t look like them at all. To me, uploading a picture that is
 not an easily recognizable picture of that person defeats the point,
 which I’m working toward, to try to express who they are. On the other
 hand, professional photographers usually have a subject whom they don’t
 know personally, so they end up having to try to capture an image that
 they’ve created based on who they think the person is or how they want
 that person to appear. You know how sculptors often say that they’re
 just freeing an image from a block? What I’m trying to do is free
 someone’s soul from his or her image. There are a lot of things that
 make this hard. A lot of people are uncomfortable in front of a camera,
 or might make expressions that aren’t very natural for them. And if the
 person is nervous, it’s very difficult to try to see what it is that
 you’re trying to capture.
A lot of what I’m doing is, I just start shooting photos. After half an
 hour of having their picture taken, people start to ignore you. Or I’ll
 take pictures when I’m talking to people about what they’re doing, so
 after a while they get distracted by the conversation and forget about
 the camera. That’s something that I’m not perfect at, but I’m getting
 better.
I think good photographers are also able to disarm people through
 conversation, but still, it’s difficult to have a disarming conversation
 with somebody you don’t know, or to make them laugh. Many times people
 make a face for me that they wouldn’t make for a professional
 photographer.
For instance, a board meeting picture, like the one with Eric Saltzman:
 that was during a very tense discussion. I’ve found that people are at
 their most animated at these kinds of meetings, and look the most alive
 when they are under a lot of pressure, and super- focused. But usually
 if an outsider is in the room, they won’t get into that. I mean, it
 would be difficult for a cameraman to be in a room where a board is
 having a heated debate.
But those are the things that I’m trying to capture, because most people
 don’t get to see that. At the Creative Commons board meeting, Larry
 asked me to put the camera away after awhile [laughs] because it was
 distracting. We were having a very heated discussion and I was taking
 all of these pictures. But he credited me later because afterward those
 pictures turned out the best.
In your mind, what is a ‘Freesoul’ ?
A freesoul is somewhat of a pun. On the one hand it means you are free,
 liberated. You, as a human spirit, are open. And then, it also has the
 meaning that you are unencumbered legally, that you are free, as in
 ‘free software.’
There’s a paradox: with many people’s Wikipedia
 articles to which I’ve contributed, when it comes to the picture, many
 of these people don’t have any free photos of themselves on the web, so
 while they are “notable” on Wikipedia, their images aren’t free of the
 copyright of the photographer, or the institution who hired the
 photographer to take the picture. Often, even the subject of the article
 can’t make an image available to the Wikimedia/Wikipedia community.
This means that a lot of people who have a Net presence have a legally
 encumbered Net presence. People who are invited to conferences get asked
 all the time, “By the way, do you have a photo that we can use?” But
 they don’t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons
 license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.
The third part of the pun is that, since I’m asking for a model release
 from the subjects, I’m asking everyone to be much more open and giving
 about their image than most people typically are. I’m giving, you’re
 giving, we’re all giving to participate and to try to create this
 wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.
Of course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But
 I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The
 fact is, it’s much more likely that somebody is going to use these
 pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The
 benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of
 our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the
 benefits.
This is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give. In a
 way, giving up your image and allowing anyone to use it: it’s the
 ultimate gift. In one way it’s kind of vain. [laughs] But in another
 way it’s wonderful. A Wikipedia article on some person but with no
 picture is sad.
Besides Wikipedia, how do you imagine these photos being used?
They can be used in textbooks and in mainstream media articles about the
 person. Now they can get a picture that represents the person, at least
 from my perspective. That said, I shouldn’t be the only person doing
 this. More people should do the same, and make the photographs available
 freely. For one, I feel that “free” CC licensed photos have a much
 higher chance of not disappearing. But I don’t know exactly how these
 photos are going to be used, so in a sense I’m curious. For example,
 recently I received the Harvard Berkman Center pamphlet. It was a report
 of what they’re doing, and they also had a bunch of my pictures in
 there. They all had attribution, and it made me feel really good. There
 were pictures of different Berkman Center members that I had taken in
 various places all over the world. I think that the subject is probably
 happy with this, and I’m happy, and the Berkman Center’s happy because
 they’re not all pictures of people sitting at desks in the Berkman
 Center. There’s one more important thing: Creative Commons is great for
 original creative works or derivative creative works, but when it
 involves human images, it gets very complicated. We all know the Virgin
 Mobile case, where Virgin used CC licensed images in an advertisement
 without getting permission from the models, and got in trouble. What
 we’re trying to do here is to expand beyond just copyright, to make it
 more thorough from a legal perspective. It’s also an important
 educational point, so people understand that, in addition to the
 Creative Commons licenses, we need people to provide other rights in
 cases where the law requires such rights to be cleared before reuse.
What have you learned about the people in these networks, just in the past year?
That’s a good question. I think that at least Creative Commons has
 become much more mainstream. Creative Commons has moved from a fringy
 academic discussion to a boardroom discussion. Yahoo announced that it
 will be using Creative Commons for all of their basic infrastructure,
 and integrating it all. Google has CC search in their advanced search.
Microsoft is working with CC as well and have a plug-in. Nine Inch Nails
 released their album, Ghost, under a Creative Commons license. The list
 goes on. Many people are asking: can you make money and share? The
 answer is, yes. CC is becoming an important part of the business
 discussion.
But one thing that happens when a movement like CC becomes a business
 thing, is that a lot of the pioneers fade into the background, and it
 becomes a part of industry. This happened to the Internet. And so while
 you still have the core people who still remember and hold the torch for
 the philosophical side, the Internet has become much more of a business.
 Now, when you go to many Internet conferences, it’s mostly salesmen in
 attendance.
I believe that the success of the Internet has two parts. The first part
 is the market- driven business side, which has made the Internet
 affordable and ubiquitous. The second part is the strong movement of
 participants who fight to keep the Internet open and try to prevent the
 business side from corrupting the fundamental elements that make the
 Internet great. The Net Neutrality or Open Network discussion going on
 right now is a good example of the importance of continuing to balance
 these principles with business interests.
Similarly, I think that business interests can help make Creative
 Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I
 think it’s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more
 “free” and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or
 destructive ways.
In addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by
 educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of
 science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we
 have the license ported to at least 44 jurisdictions, and the number of
 countries with projects continues to grow. In many ways, the movement
 outside of the United States has become much bigger than the movement in
 the United States. Although the United States is still slightly farther
 ahead in terms of commercialization, the size of the whole free culture
 movement outside of the United States is huge now. The CC China Photo
 exhibit was just amazing. There were some great
 images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is
 beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we’re
 making is international.
What are your personal realizations or experiences?
Well, we’re all getting old, if you look at these pictures. But there’s
 another thing, though, about this book: the number of
 professional-quality amateurs has increased significantly due to the
 importance of digital in both professional and high-end amateur
 photography I hate to say it, a lot of people love the darkroom, but it
 really feels like the death of the darkroom with this year.
With new 22 megapixel cameras coming in under $10,000, and Lightroom
 and some of this software at a couple hundred dollars, it doesn’t really
 make sense, except for particularly fussy artists, to do wet-work
 anymore. If you’re a commercial photographer or a high-end amateur, you
 can do anything you used to do in the darkroom. I think it has really
 lowered the bar. I don’t know how that affects the industry directly,
 but for me, it bridged a huge gap.
I used to be darkroom geek. I loved my darkroom, and even when I didn’t
 have my darkroom anymore, I still was shooting 6x6 Hasselblad 120 film
 and processing it in a special lab, and then digitizing it. For me, that
 film was it. You could never get as good as medium-format film or
 large-format film
At the time, the digital Hasselblad backs were too expensive, and were
 still not as good as 8x10 film. So there was this whole period where the
 darkroom was not all that exciting, but the digital wasn’t perfect. I
 went through a limbo period. I had invested so much in my Hasselblad
 system, and my Leica M6 set. I had bought the Leica R8, but I was
 kicking myself because it was terrible. But then the Leica M8 came out,
 and I bought one at the beginning of 2007. The M8 really got me to where
 I could use my old gear, and it had enough megapixels to be as good as
 some film.
Another way of saying it was that there was a gear breakthrough at the
 beginning of last year. Okay, that’s pretty materialistic! So there was
 a technology breakthrough, let’s call it that, that allowed me to switch
 completely away from film, and I think this happened to a lot of
 photographers. It caused an explosion of content and an increase in the
 quality of content on sites like Flickr. It has
 allowed amateurs to create a business model with professionals.
 Interestingly, I think these new high-end amateurs are buying more
 photography books and photographs and are probably providing an
 increasing revenue stream for professional photographers. I think most
 amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and
 not trying to “compete” with them.
Despite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?
For me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by
 making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like
 best. Dopplr is a great example. When
 I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the
 same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew
 in London, and a huge percentage of those people don’t live there. I
 would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of
 friends, and they’re not in their hometown.
That’s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it’s
 really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a
 smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your
 meetings don’t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in
 this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn’t
 see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real
 friends, than I’ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,
 but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.
What’s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was
 sharing with that person. It’s not just a connection on a social network
 online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos
 and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we
 were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that’s a much more
 rich experience.
It’s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality
 is “the present” plus what you remember from the past. I think this
 project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as
 well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I
 look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of
 presence.
I think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying
 around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,
 being able to connect with people through social software mostly
 increases your travel, it doesn’t decrease it. It is great because you
 get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad
 for our jet lag.
How would you characterize your contributions to free culture?
I think it’s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we
 actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, “I did this” or “I did
 that.” I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions
 or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.
Having said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting
 Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now
 CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track
 and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in
 Free Culture.
Specifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a
 balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement
 is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.
 Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of
 operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me
 to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free
 Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.
However, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to
 celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I’m a huge fan
 of Larry’s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But
 more than anything, I’m thankful for and respectful of all of the
 participants who aren’t so well known and who are essential to moving
 everything forward.
Personally, I don’t think it’s ultimately meaningful to talk about one
 individual’s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is
 in the whole movement. I’m just one participant. Just another free soul.

 exhibit was just amazing. There were some great
 images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is
 beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we’re
 making is international.
What are your personal realizations or experiences?
Well, we’re all getting old, if you look at these pictures. But there’s
 another thing, though, about this book: the number of
 professional-quality amateurs has increased significantly due to the
 importance of digital in both professional and high-end amateur
 photography I hate to say it, a lot of people love the darkroom, but it
 really feels like the death of the darkroom with this year.
With new 22 megapixel cameras coming in under $10,000, and Lightroom
 and some of this software at a couple hundred dollars, it doesn’t really
 make sense, except for particularly fussy artists, to do wet-work
 anymore. If you’re a commercial photographer or a high-end amateur, you
 can do anything you used to do in the darkroom. I think it has really
 lowered the bar. I don’t know how that affects the industry directly,
 but for me, it bridged a huge gap.
I used to be darkroom geek. I loved my darkroom, and even when I didn’t
 have my darkroom anymore, I still was shooting 6x6 Hasselblad 120 film
 and processing it in a special lab, and then digitizing it. For me, that
 film was it. You could never get as good as medium-format film or
 large-format film
At the time, the digital Hasselblad backs were too expensive, and were
 still not as good as 8x10 film. So there was this whole period where the
 darkroom was not all that exciting, but the digital wasn’t perfect. I
 went through a limbo period. I had invested so much in my Hasselblad
 system, and my Leica M6 set. I had bought the Leica R8, but I was
 kicking myself because it was terrible. But then the Leica M8 came out,
 and I bought one at the beginning of 2007. The M8 really got me to where
 I could use my old gear, and it had enough megapixels to be as good as
 some film.
Another way of saying it was that there was a gear breakthrough at the
 beginning of last year. Okay, that’s pretty materialistic! So there was
 a technology breakthrough, let’s call it that, that allowed me to switch
 completely away from film, and I think this happened to a lot of
 photographers. It caused an explosion of content and an increase in the
 quality of content on sites like Flickr. It has
 allowed amateurs to create a business model with professionals.
 Interestingly, I think these new high-end amateurs are buying more
 photography books and photographs and are probably providing an
 increasing revenue stream for professional photographers. I think most
 amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and
 not trying to “compete” with them.
Despite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?
For me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by
 making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like
 best. Dopplr is a great example. When
 I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the
 same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew
 in London, and a huge percentage of those people don’t live there. I
 would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of
 friends, and they’re not in their hometown.
That’s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it’s
 really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a
 smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your
 meetings don’t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in
 this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn’t
 see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real
 friends, than I’ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,
 but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.
What’s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was
 sharing with that person. It’s not just a connection on a social network
 online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos
 and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we
 were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that’s a much more
 rich experience.
It’s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality
 is “the present” plus what you remember from the past. I think this
 project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as
 well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I
 look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of
 presence.
I think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying
 around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,
 being able to connect with people through social software mostly
 increases your travel, it doesn’t decrease it. It is great because you
 get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad
 for our jet lag.
How would you characterize your contributions to free culture?
I think it’s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we
 actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, “I did this” or “I did
 that.” I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions
 or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.
Having said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting
 Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now
 CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track
 and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in
 Free Culture.
Specifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a
 balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement
 is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.
 Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of
 operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me
 to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free
 Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.
However, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to
 celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I’m a huge fan
 of Larry’s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But
 more than anything, I’m thankful for and respectful of all of the
 participants who aren’t so well known and who are essential to moving
 everything forward.
Personally, I don’t think it’s ultimately meaningful to talk about one
 individual’s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is
 in the whole movement. I’m just one participant. Just another free soul.

In his foreword to the book, Lessig writes that you understand your subjects “by learning to see them in a certain way.” What is that certain way?
I think I’m trying to get a mental image of a person, certain
 expressions, or what I think that person is about. I’m trying to capture
 what I think they look like, which is many times a minority of their
 typical expressions, or their typical stance. So, if I’m taking pictures
 of Larry [Lessig], I want to have his signature hand gestures, and not
 just random ones.
I think I’m trying to capture pictures of people that help others see
 what they’re about. Some photographers will make someone look the way
 the photographer wants them to look, and not the way they appear, so
 they’ll pick the one picture out of 100 where the guy looks more
 egotistical than he really is. Some photographers are almost medical,
 and are going after a perfect portrait. I’m somewhere in between.
It’s amazing how many people will upload snapshots of people where the
 pictures don’t look like them at all. To me, uploading a picture that is
 not an easily recognizable picture of that person defeats the point,
 which I’m working toward, to try to express who they are. On the other
 hand, professional photographers usually have a subject whom they don’t
 know personally, so they end up having to try to capture an image that
 they’ve created based on who they think the person is or how they want
 that person to appear. You know how sculptors often say that they’re
 just freeing an image from a block? What I’m trying to do is free
 someone’s soul from his or her image. There are a lot of things that
 make this hard. A lot of people are uncomfortable in front of a camera,
 or might make expressions that aren’t very natural for them. And if the
 person is nervous, it’s very difficult to try to see what it is that
 you’re trying to capture.
A lot of what I’m doing is, I just start shooting photos. After half an
 hour of having their picture taken, people start to ignore you. Or I’ll
 take pictures when I’m talking to people about what they’re doing, so
 after a while they get distracted by the conversation and forget about
 the camera. That’s something that I’m not perfect at, but I’m getting
 better.
I think good photographers are also able to disarm people through
 conversation, but still, it’s difficult to have a disarming conversation
 with somebody you don’t know, or to make them laugh. Many times people
 make a face for me that they wouldn’t make for a professional
 photographer.
For instance, a board meeting picture, like the one with Eric Saltzman:
 that was during a very tense discussion. I’ve found that people are at
 their most animated at these kinds of meetings, and look the most alive
 when they are under a lot of pressure, and super- focused. But usually
 if an outsider is in the room, they won’t get into that. I mean, it
 would be difficult for a cameraman to be in a room where a board is
 having a heated debate.
But those are the things that I’m trying to capture, because most people
 don’t get to see that. At the Creative Commons board meeting, Larry
 asked me to put the camera away after awhile [laughs] because it was
 distracting. We were having a very heated discussion and I was taking
 all of these pictures. But he credited me later because afterward those
 pictures turned out the best.
In your mind, what is a ‘Freesoul’ ?
A freesoul is somewhat of a pun. On the one hand it means you are free,
 liberated. You, as a human spirit, are open. And then, it also has the
 meaning that you are unencumbered legally, that you are free, as in
 ‘free software.’
There’s a paradox: with many people’s Wikipedia
 articles to which I’ve contributed, when it comes to the picture, many
 of these people don’t have any free photos of themselves on the web, so
 while they are “notable” on Wikipedia, their images aren’t free of the
 copyright of the photographer, or the institution who hired the
 photographer to take the picture. Often, even the subject of the article
 can’t make an image available to the Wikimedia/Wikipedia community.
This means that a lot of people who have a Net presence have a legally
 encumbered Net presence. People who are invited to conferences get asked
 all the time, “By the way, do you have a photo that we can use?” But
 they don’t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons
 license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.
The third part of the pun is that, since I’m asking for a model release
 from the subjects, I’m asking everyone to be much more open and giving
 about their image than most people typically are. I’m giving, you’re
 giving, we’re all giving to participate and to try to create this
 wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.
Of course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But
 I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The
 fact is, it’s much more likely that somebody is going to use these
 pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The
 benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of
 our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the
 benefits.
This is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give. In a
 way, giving up your image and allowing anyone to use it: it’s the
 ultimate gift. In one way it’s kind of vain. [laughs] But in another
 way it’s wonderful. A Wikipedia article on some person but with no
 picture is sad.
Besides Wikipedia, how do you imagine these photos being used?
They can be used in textbooks and in mainstream media articles about the
 person. Now they can get a picture that represents the person, at least
 from my perspective. That said, I shouldn’t be the only person doing
 this. More people should do the same, and make the photographs available
 freely. For one, I feel that “free” CC licensed photos have a much
 higher chance of not disappearing. But I don’t know exactly how these
 photos are going to be used, so in a sense I’m curious. For example,
 recently I received the Harvard Berkman Center pamphlet. It was a report
 of what they’re doing, and they also had a bunch of my pictures in
 there. They all had attribution, and it made me feel really good. There
 were pictures of different Berkman Center members that I had taken in
 various places all over the world. I think that the subject is probably
 happy with this, and I’m happy, and the Berkman Center’s happy because
 they’re not all pictures of people sitting at desks in the Berkman
 Center. There’s one more important thing: Creative Commons is great for
 original creative works or derivative creative works, but when it
 involves human images, it gets very complicated. We all know the Virgin
 Mobile case, where Virgin used CC licensed images in an advertisement
 without getting permission from the models, and got in trouble. What
 we’re trying to do here is to expand beyond just copyright, to make it
 more thorough from a legal perspective. It’s also an important
 educational point, so people understand that, in addition to the
 Creative Commons licenses, we need people to provide other rights in
 cases where the law requires such rights to be cleared before reuse.
What have you learned about the people in these networks, just in the past year?
That’s a good question. I think that at least Creative Commons has
 become much more mainstream. Creative Commons has moved from a fringy
 academic discussion to a boardroom discussion. Yahoo announced that it
 will be using Creative Commons for all of their basic infrastructure,
 and integrating it all. Google has CC search in their advanced search.
Microsoft is working with CC as well and have a plug-in. Nine Inch Nails
 released their album, Ghost, under a Creative Commons license. The list
 goes on. Many people are asking: can you make money and share? The
 answer is, yes. CC is becoming an important part of the business
 discussion.
But one thing that happens when a movement like CC becomes a business
 thing, is that a lot of the pioneers fade into the background, and it
 becomes a part of industry. This happened to the Internet. And so while
 you still have the core people who still remember and hold the torch for
 the philosophical side, the Internet has become much more of a business.
 Now, when you go to many Internet conferences, it’s mostly salesmen in
 attendance.
I believe that the success of the Internet has two parts. The first part
 is the market- driven business side, which has made the Internet
 affordable and ubiquitous. The second part is the strong movement of
 participants who fight to keep the Internet open and try to prevent the
 business side from corrupting the fundamental elements that make the
 Internet great. The Net Neutrality or Open Network discussion going on
 right now is a good example of the importance of continuing to balance
 these principles with business interests.
Similarly, I think that business interests can help make Creative
 Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I
 think it’s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more
 “free” and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or
 destructive ways.
In addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by
 educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of
 science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we
 have the license ported to at least 44 jurisdictions, and the number of
 countries with projects continues to grow. In many ways, the movement
 outside of the United States has become much bigger than the movement in
 the United States. Although the United States is still slightly farther
 ahead in terms of commercialization, the size of the whole free culture
 movement outside of the United States is huge now. The CC China Photo
 exhibit was just amazing. There were some great
 images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is
 beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we’re

 Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I
 think it’s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more
 “free” and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or
 destructive ways.
In addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by
 educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of
 science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we
 have the license ported to at least 44 jurisdictions, and the number of
 countries with projects continues to grow. In many ways, the movement
 outside of the United States has become much bigger than the movement in
 the United States. Although the United States is still slightly farther
 ahead in terms of commercialization, the size of the whole free culture
 movement outside of the United States is huge now. The CC China Photo
 exhibit was just amazing. There were some great
 images, and a lot of the photographers were professionals. This is
 beyond what anybody has done in the US. A lot of the progress that we’re
 making is international.
What are your personal realizations or experiences?
Well, we’re all getting old, if you look at these pictures. But there’s
 another thing, though, about this book: the number of
 professional-quality amateurs has increased significantly due to the
 importance of digital in both professional and high-end amateur
 photography I hate to say it, a lot of people love the darkroom, but it
 really feels like the death of the darkroom with this year.
With new 22 megapixel cameras coming in under $10,000, and Lightroom
 and some of this software at a couple hundred dollars, it doesn’t really
 make sense, except for particularly fussy artists, to do wet-work
 anymore. If you’re a commercial photographer or a high-end amateur, you
 can do anything you used to do in the darkroom. I think it has really
 lowered the bar. I don’t know how that affects the industry directly,
 but for me, it bridged a huge gap.
I used to be darkroom geek. I loved my darkroom, and even when I didn’t
 have my darkroom anymore, I still was shooting 6x6 Hasselblad 120 film
 and processing it in a special lab, and then digitizing it. For me, that
 film was it. You could never get as good as medium-format film or
 large-format film
At the time, the digital Hasselblad backs were too expensive, and were
 still not as good as 8x10 film. So there was this whole period where the
 darkroom was not all that exciting, but the digital wasn’t perfect. I
 went through a limbo period. I had invested so much in my Hasselblad
 system, and my Leica M6 set. I had bought the Leica R8, but I was
 kicking myself because it was terrible. But then the Leica M8 came out,
 and I bought one at the beginning of 2007. The M8 really got me to where
 I could use my old gear, and it had enough megapixels to be as good as
 some film.
Another way of saying it was that there was a gear breakthrough at the
 beginning of last year. Okay, that’s pretty materialistic! So there was
 a technology breakthrough, let’s call it that, that allowed me to switch
 completely away from film, and I think this happened to a lot of
 photographers. It caused an explosion of content and an increase in the
 quality of content on sites like Flickr. It has
 allowed amateurs to create a business model with professionals.
 Interestingly, I think these new high-end amateurs are buying more
 photography books and photographs and are probably providing an
 increasing revenue stream for professional photographers. I think most
 amateurs, including myself, are paying homage to the professionals and
 not trying to “compete” with them.
Despite the existence of social software, what is still important about meeting people face-to-face?
For me, the right way to use a lot of the new social software is by
 making it easier to spend more physical time with the people you like
 best. Dopplr is a great example. When
 I visit a city, I will see all of the people who are in the city at the
 same time. When I went to London awhile ago, there were 47 people I knew
 in London, and a huge percentage of those people don’t live there. I
 would bet that more than half of the photos in this book are pictures of
 friends, and they’re not in their hometown.
That’s the really interesting thing that is happening right now: it’s
 really increasing your ability to spend quality time with, actually, a
 smaller number of people. It allows you to actively filter. Your
 meetings don’t have to be random. If I look at the list of people in
 this book, although there are some obvious people missing whom I didn’t
 see last year, probably met more of my friends last year, my real
 friends, than I’ve met in any other year. I know my travels were crazy,
 but I think that the online world has allowed me to do that.
What’s great about photography is that it captures the moment that I was
 sharing with that person. It’s not just a connection on a social network
 online, which is really pretty binary. I can look at all these photos
 and remember exactly what we were doing, what we were eating, what we
 were drinking, what we were talking about, and to me that’s a much more
 rich experience.
It’s the combination of social software and photography. For me, reality
 is “the present” plus what you remember from the past. I think this
 project is really sharing memories with people. Blog posts contribute as
 well, but to me photography is a really good way of doing that. When I
 look at the expressions, I remember the moment and get a sense of
 presence.
I think the main problem for me is the environmental impact of flying
 around. Just as I never believed that we would have a paperless office,
 being able to connect with people through social software mostly
 increases your travel, it doesn’t decrease it. It is great because you
 get to meet all these people. But it is bad for the environment, and bad
 for our jet lag.
How would you characterize your contributions to free culture?
I think it’s mostly incremental. I think there is very little we
 actually do all by ourselves, and I hate saying, “I did this” or “I did
 that.” I think that in most cases, focusing on individual contributions
 or achievements undervalues the importance of everyone else involved.
Having said that, I think my main contribution is probably in supporting
 Creative Commons as a fan, board member, chairman of the board and now
 CEO. I think CC has a significant role, and helping to keep it on track
 and growing is probably the single most important role that I have in
 Free Culture.
Specifically, I think that trying to keep an international focus and a
 balance between business and the non-business elements of the movement
 is essential. My job is to keep that focus and maintain that balance.
 Also, CC needs to run smoothly as an organization and there is a lot of
 operational work that we all need to do. My photography is a way for me
 to participate in a small measure on the creative side of the Free
 Culture movement, and helps me see things from that perspective as well.
However, I believe in emergent democracy and the importance of trying to
 celebrate the community more than the heroes. Of course, I’m a huge fan
 of Larry’s and I have great respect for the leaders of our movement. But
 more than anything, I’m thankful for and respectful of all of the
 participants who aren’t so well known and who are essential to moving
 everything forward.
Personally, I don’t think it’s ultimately meaningful to talk about one
 individual’s personal contribution to any movement. The real meaning is
 in the whole movement. I’m just one participant. Just another free soul.

70,"Just another free soul
In his foreword to the book, Lessig writes that you understand your subjects “by learning to see them in a certain way.” What is that certain way?
I think I’m trying to get a mental image of a person, certain
 expressions, or what I think that person is about. I’m trying to capture
 what I think they look like, which is many times a minority of their
 typical expressions, or their typical stance. So, if I’m taking pictures
 of Larry [Lessig], I want to have his signature hand gestures, and not
 just random ones.
I think I’m trying to capture pictures of people that help others see
 what they’re about. Some photographers will make someone look the way
 the photographer wants them to look, and not the way they appear, so
 they’ll pick the one picture out of 100 where the guy looks more
 egotistical than he really is. Some photographers are almost medical,
 and are going after a perfect portrait. I’m somewhere in between.
It’s amazing how many people will upload snapshots of people where the
 pictures don’t look like them at all. To me, uploading a picture that is
 not an easily recognizable picture of that person defeats the point,
 which I’m working toward, to try to express who they are. On the other
 hand, professional photographers usually have a subject whom they don’t
 know personally, so they end up having to try to capture an image that
 they’ve created based on who they think the person is or how they want
 that person to appear. You know how sculptors often say that they’re
 just freeing an image from a block? What I’m trying to do is free
 someone’s soul from his or her image. There are a lot of things that
 make this hard. A lot of people are uncomfortable in front of a camera,
 or might make expressions that aren’t very natural for them. And if the
 person is nervous, it’s very difficult to try to see what it is that
 you’re trying to capture.
A lot of what I’m doing is, I just start shooting photos. After half an
 hour of having their picture taken, people start to ignore you. Or I’ll
 take pictures when I’m talking to people about what they’re doing, so
 after a while they get distracted by the conversation and forget about
 the camera. That’s something that I’m not perfect at, but I’m getting
 better.
I think good photographers are also able to disarm people through
 conversation, but still, it’s difficult to have a disarming conversation
 with somebody you don’t know, or to make them laugh. Many times people
 make a face for me that they wouldn’t make for a professional
 photographer.
For instance, a board meeting picture, like the one with Eric Saltzman:
 that was during a very tense discussion. I’ve found that people are at
 their most animated at these kinds of meetings, and look the most alive
 when they are under a lot of pressure, and super- focused. But usually
 if an outsider is in the room, they won’t get into that. I mean, it
 would be difficult for a cameraman to be in a room where a board is
 having a heated debate.
But those are the things that I’m trying to capture, because most people
 don’t get to see that. At the Creative Commons board meeting, Larry
 asked me to put the camera away after awhile [laughs] because it was
 distracting. We were having a very heated discussion and I was taking
 all of these pictures. But he credited me later because afterward those
 pictures turned out the best.
In your mind, what is a ‘Freesoul’ ?
A freesoul is somewhat of a pun. On the one hand it means you are free,
 liberated. You, as a human spirit, are open. And then, it also has the
 meaning that you are unencumbered legally, that you are free, as in
 ‘free software.’
There’s a paradox: with many people’s Wikipedia
 articles to which I’ve contributed, when it comes to the picture, many
 of these people don’t have any free photos of themselves on the web, so
 while they are “notable” on Wikipedia, their images aren’t free of the
 copyright of the photographer, or the institution who hired the
 photographer to take the picture. Often, even the subject of the article
 can’t make an image available to the Wikimedia/Wikipedia community.
This means that a lot of people who have a Net presence have a legally
 encumbered Net presence. People who are invited to conferences get asked
 all the time, “By the way, do you have a photo that we can use?” But
 they don’t. By making these pictures available under a Creative Commons
 license, now they do. This is solving the issue of legal freedom.
The third part of the pun is that, since I’m asking for a model release
 from the subjects, I’m asking everyone to be much more open and giving
 about their image than most people typically are. I’m giving, you’re
 giving, we’re all giving to participate and to try to create this
 wonderful work, and allow others to create derivative works.
Of course people can abuse that, just like they can abuse anything. But
 I want people to see the value in sharing over the fear in sharing. The
 fact is, it’s much more likely that somebody is going to use these
 pictures for something positive, rather than for something negative. The
 benefits greatly outweigh the risks. I think we spend way too much of
 our lives worrying about the risks, at the cost of a lot of the
 benefits.
This is a celebration of all of the people who are willing to give. In a
 way, giving up your image and allowing anyone to use it: it’s the
 ultimate gift. In one way it’s kind of vain. [laughs] But in another
 way it’s wonderful. A Wikipedia article on some person but with no
 picture is sad.
Besides Wikipedia, how do you imagine these photos being used?
They can be used in textbooks and in mainstream media articles about the
 person. Now they can get a picture that represents the person, at least
 from my perspective. That said, I shouldn’t be the only person doing
 this. More people should do the same, and make the photographs available
 freely. For one, I feel that “free” CC licensed photos have a much
 higher chance of not disappearing. But I don’t know exactly how these
 photos are going to be used, so in a sense I’m curious. For example,
 recently I received the Harvard Berkman Center pamphlet. It was a report
 of what they’re doing, and they also had a bunch of my pictures in
 there. They all had attribution, and it made me feel really good. There
 were pictures of different Berkman Center members that I had taken in
 various places all over the world. I think that the subject is probably
 happy with this, and I’m happy, and the Berkman Center’s happy because
 they’re not all pictures of people sitting at desks in the Berkman
 Center. There’s one more important thing: Creative Commons is great for
 original creative works or derivative creative works, but when it
 involves human images, it gets very complicated. We all know the Virgin
 Mobile case, where Virgin used CC licensed images in an advertisement
 without getting permission from the models, and got in trouble. What
 we’re trying to do here is to expand beyond just copyright, to make it
 more thorough from a legal perspective. It’s also an important
 educational point, so people understand that, in addition to the
 Creative Commons licenses, we need people to provide other rights in
 cases where the law requires such rights to be cleared before reuse.
What have you learned about the people in these networks, just in the past year?
That’s a good question. I think that at least Creative Commons has
 become much more mainstream. Creative Commons has moved from a fringy
 academic discussion to a boardroom discussion. Yahoo announced that it
 will be using Creative Commons for all of their basic infrastructure,
 and integrating it all. Google has CC search in their advanced search.
Microsoft is working with CC as well and have a plug-in. Nine Inch Nails
 released their album, Ghost, under a Creative Commons license. The list
 goes on. Many people are asking: can you make money and share? The
 answer is, yes. CC is becoming an important part of the business
 discussion.
But one thing that happens when a movement like CC becomes a business
 thing, is that a lot of the pioneers fade into the background, and it
 becomes a part of industry. This happened to the Internet. And so while
 you still have the core people who still remember and hold the torch for
 the philosophical side, the Internet has become much more of a business.
 Now, when you go to many Internet conferences, it’s mostly salesmen in
 attendance.
I believe that the success of the Internet has two parts. The first part
 is the market- driven business side, which has made the Internet
 affordable and ubiquitous. The second part is the strong movement of
 participants who fight to keep the Internet open and try to prevent the
 business side from corrupting the fundamental elements that make the
 Internet great. The Net Neutrality or Open Network discussion going on
 right now is a good example of the importance of continuing to balance
 these principles with business interests.
Similarly, I think that business interests can help make Creative
 Commons ubiquitous and more easily accessible to everyone. However, I
 think it’s important to remember to keep pushing to make content more
 “free” and not allow businesses to use Creative Commons in exploitive or
 destructive ways.
In addition to the business side, Creative Commons is being used by
 educators to create open courseware around the world and in the area of
 science and technology to promote sharing in research. And as of now, we

71,"Sharism: A Mind Revolution
With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and
 freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner
 dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What
 motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?
 A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social
 capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of
 Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called
 Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it
 in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is
 in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a
 mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to
 transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain.
The Neuron Doctrine
Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many
 pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in
 neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.
 Although we can’t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do
 have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its
 neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,
 electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form
 vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the
 synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by
 sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more
 meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,
 such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons
 work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the
 brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and
 information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas
 and decisions about human networks.
Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has
 profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an
 intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative
 ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The
 idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of
 amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a
 creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,
 you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you
 generate even more ideas in return. It’s a kind of butterfly- effect, as
 the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,
 and the world, more creative.
However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative
 productivity, if only because they’ve switched off their sharing paths.
 People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that
 tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in
 the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and
 not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to
 share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her
 mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative
 choice, her choice will be, “Share.”
These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and
 society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these
 micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result
 in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a
 company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are
 not, what they defend as “cultural goods” and “intellectual property”
 are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much
 of their “culture” will be protected, but the net result is the direct
 loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the
 potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our
 life, which may start to swallow other values as well.
Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private
 and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between
 public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum
 of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable
 creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We
 shouldn’t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing
 private and stay “closed.” They may fear the Internet creates a
 potential for abuse that they can’t fight alone. However, the paradox
 is: The less you share, the less power you have.
New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism
Let’s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer
 bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers
 following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was
 happening, but the rest of the world hadn’t yet realized it. The shift
 toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just
 five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,
 to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to
 the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More
 bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The
 revolution was viral.
Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and
 connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and
 quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete
 gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become
 a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a
 small site, it’s hard to stop. We can’t explain this fact with a theory
 of addiction. It’s an impulse to share. It’s the energy of the memes
 that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It’s more
 than just E-mail. It’s Sharism.
Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in
 mind, by asking themselves, “Who is going to see this?” Bloggers are
 agile in adjusting their tone−and privacy settings−to advance ideas and
 stay out of trouble. It’s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart
 expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into
 the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system
 and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they
 can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how
 Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The
 checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but
 you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a
 box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have
 seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while
 retaining flexible choices.
The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and
 cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to
 another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like
 ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple
 online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a
 result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true
 alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving
 Sharism in our closed culture.
Local Practice, Global Gain
If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural
 setting, it’s hard to get it back. But it’s not impossible. A
 persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of
 Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.
 Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently.
You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and
 returning to a closed mindset. Here’s an idea: put a sticky note on your
 desk that says, “What do you want to share today?” I’m not kidding.
 Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way
 to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social
 software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,
 but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from
 your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it
 might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see
 if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You
 will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive
 results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate
 reward. But there are others.
The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of
 comments. Then you know you’ve provoked interest, appreciation,
 excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being
 shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you
 will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,
 the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the
 third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be
 forwarded, circulated and republished via other people’s networks. This
 cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses.
Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as
 fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You’re
 about to become popular, and fast
This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning
 not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you
 may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This
 one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing
 path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate
 about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of
 development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.
 Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And
 it’s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get
 something just as substantial: Happiness.
The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will
 be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by
 people themselves. Media won’t be controlled by any single person but
 will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These “Shaeros”
 (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first
 wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to
 everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a
 system.
Sharism Safeguards Your Rights
Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in
 new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of
 control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in
 personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said
 that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing
 environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social
 applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.
 Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,
 but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can
 also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional
 copyright holder, this sounds ideal.
Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that
 can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and “All
 Rights Reserved” are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much
 to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the
 more people remix your works, the higher the return.
I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for
 those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people’s
 sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their
 property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also
 lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all
 property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like
 to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity
Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It’s not a very hard
 concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free
 Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.
 These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for
 both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new
 licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it’s becoming
 easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems.
The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain
Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a
 naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the
 power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world
 into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and
 software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social
 Software.
This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for
 human society. With new “hairy” emergent technologies sprouting all
 around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the
 throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we
 social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all
 people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will
 be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now
 we can put it all online.
Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not
 be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This
 may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing
 policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I’m discussing can
 improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging
 democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,
 social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share
 data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence
 of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our
 rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be
 made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.
 This “Emergent Democracy” is more real-time than periodical
 parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our
 choices, beyond the binary options of “Yes” or “No” referenda.
 Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because
 we will represent ourselves within the system.
Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing
 environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the
 public’s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant
 support from her peers and her peers’ peers. Appeals to justice will
 take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.
 Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With
 multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become
 more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act
 alone.
Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of
 the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and
 mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational
 system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community
 of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to
 social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society
 down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle
 is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and
 machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,
 anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more
 flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create
 a new social order−A Mind Revolution!

71,"Sharism: A Mind Revolution
With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and
 freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner
 dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What
 motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?
 A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social
 capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of
 Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called
 Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it
 in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is
 in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a
 mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to
 transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain.
The Neuron Doctrine
Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many
 pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in
 neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.
 Although we can’t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do
 have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its
 neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,
 electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form
 vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the
 synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by
 sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more
 meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,
 such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons
 work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the
 brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and
 information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas
 and decisions about human networks.
Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has
 profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an
 intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative
 ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The
 idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of
 amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a
 creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,
 you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you
 generate even more ideas in return. It’s a kind of butterfly- effect, as
 the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,
 and the world, more creative.
However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative
 productivity, if only because they’ve switched off their sharing paths.
 People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that
 tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in
 the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and
 not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to
 share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her
 mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative
 choice, her choice will be, “Share.”
These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and
 society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these
 micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result
 in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a
 company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are
 not, what they defend as “cultural goods” and “intellectual property”
 are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much
 of their “culture” will be protected, but the net result is the direct
 loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the
 potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our
 life, which may start to swallow other values as well.
Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private
 and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between
 public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum
 of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable
 creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We
 shouldn’t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing
 private and stay “closed.” They may fear the Internet creates a
 potential for abuse that they can’t fight alone. However, the paradox
 is: The less you share, the less power you have.
New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism
Let’s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer
 bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers
 following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was
 happening, but the rest of the world hadn’t yet realized it. The shift
 toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just
 five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,
 to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to
 the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More
 bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The
 revolution was viral.
Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and
 connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and
 quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete
 gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become
 a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a
 small site, it’s hard to stop. We can’t explain this fact with a theory
 of addiction. It’s an impulse to share. It’s the energy of the memes
 that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It’s more
 than just E-mail. It’s Sharism.
Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in
 mind, by asking themselves, “Who is going to see this?” Bloggers are
 agile in adjusting their tone−and privacy settings−to advance ideas and
 stay out of trouble. It’s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart
 expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into
 the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system
 and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they
 can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how
 Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The
 checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but
 you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a
 box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have
 seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while
 retaining flexible choices.
The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and
 cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to
 another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like
 ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple
 online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a
 result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true
 alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving
 Sharism in our closed culture.
Local Practice, Global Gain
If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural
 setting, it’s hard to get it back. But it’s not impossible. A
 persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of
 Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.
 Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently.
You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and
 returning to a closed mindset. Here’s an idea: put a sticky note on your
 desk that says, “What do you want to share today?” I’m not kidding.
 Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way
 to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social
 software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,
 but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from
 your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it
 might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see
 if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You
 will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive
 results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate
 reward. But there are others.
The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of
 comments. Then you know you’ve provoked interest, appreciation,
 excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being
 shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you
 will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,
 the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the
 third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be
 forwarded, circulated and republished via other people’s networks. This
 cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses.
Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as
 fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You’re

This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning

Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that
 can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and “All
 Rights Reserved” are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much
 to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the
 more people remix your works, the higher the return.
I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for
 those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people’s
 sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their
 property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also
 lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all
 property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like
 to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity
Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It’s not a very hard
 concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free
 Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.
 These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for
 both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new
 licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it’s becoming
 easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems.
The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain
Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a
 naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the
 power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world
 into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and
 software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social
 Software.
This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for
 human society. With new “hairy” emergent technologies sprouting all
 around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the
 throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we
 social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all
 people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will
 be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now
 we can put it all online.
Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not
 be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This
 may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing
 policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I’m discussing can
 improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging
 democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,
 social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share
 data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence
 of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our
 rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be
 made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.
 This “Emergent Democracy” is more real-time than periodical
 parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our
 choices, beyond the binary options of “Yes” or “No” referenda.
 Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because
 we will represent ourselves within the system.
Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing
 environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the
 public’s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant
 support from her peers and her peers’ peers. Appeals to justice will
 take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.
 Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With
 multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become
 more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act
 alone.
Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of
 the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and
 mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational
 system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community
 of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to
 social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society
 down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle
 is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and
 machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,
 anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more
 flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create
 a new social order−A Mind Revolution!
